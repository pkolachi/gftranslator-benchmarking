In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem .
Political internationalism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say : the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that , divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies , can not decide on a common political path .
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention , bailout and re-launching plans , new rules , and especially financial aid : since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources , the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things .
And they possess likewise the necessary means , and the legitimate reasons to use them : two resources of incommensurable value , under certain circumstances , of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure .
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the statal-national element is after all perfectly tuned with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribute to a coefficient that is very closely connected to that element : territoriality .
Paradoxically , in fact , while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web , of a technology increasingly more sophisticated , of the immaterial , while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world , we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little immaterial such as water , harvests , oil .
Accidentally , all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space , to a territory .
So that whoever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn't , than he who happens to live in a place without crops , oil , or water .
I 'm getting to the second novelty that however predicts a split .
Whoever says Territory , State , Government , inevitably implies Politics , and hence Leadership .
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena .
On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authoritative leadership , the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation .
On the other hand a wave of discredit for existent leadership , an economic sort , revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas .
And together something ever deeper and in a certain way disturbing : a discredit , an intolerance , an image of inadequacy , a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-increasing number of Western countries .
Rather , it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour , their way of feeling and being , their culture in all accepted meanings of the word , to have had their day , and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority .
In other words , the call for leadership feeds underhandedly a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structures , that manifest itself in the sudden electoral " revoltsÂ " or abrupt twists in the collective moods in these last and latest times , from the conservative rise in Austria â $ " Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain , to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush ( and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it ) .
One gets the impression that the traditional elite , their parties , their programmes , but also their rites , their newspapers , their accredited intellectuals , some would say their formats , are finding it always more difficult to comprehend , and hence to represent , that which has been taking shape within the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening , augmenting , potentially agitating without restraint .
In face of all this , talking about a " rebellion of the massesÂ " as being the order of the day may be frankly exaggerated .
But keeping one's eyes wide open , it is not for sure .
Superglue to be able to walk on walls
To defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future be able to walk up walls like Spiderman .
It's the aim of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close .
With an adhesive of only 2.5 cm squared the scientists have succeeded in gluing a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall .
Studying â $ " The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton , Akron , of the Georgia Institute of Technology , and of the Air Force Research Laboratory .
The material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on existent materials that utilise a particular carbon structure , called carbon nanotubes .
Â " The principle behind the glue could be imagined as being like a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghettiÂ " explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
The scientists were inspired by the paws of geckoes , covered with microscopic bristles which succeed in assuring a perfect adhesion to the animal .
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass , Teflon , and sandpaper have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and at the same time " comes off from walls easierÂ " explains Liming Dai , researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton .
WALK ON WALLS ? - " This material could be useful as a temporary glueÂ " adds Liming Dai .
Perhaps for walking on walls just like Spiderman ? Maybe yes , but the researchers are thinking of a less glamorous use such as the connections between electrical devices , because the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and of electrical current .
Other applications could be within the aerospace industry .
For now , no superheroes .
OTHER RESEARCH â $ " Even Berkeley University , in California , is dedicating itself to the research of a new adhesive .
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society the Californian scientists have presented an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self-clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion .
Drugs : Never with fruit juices .
Be careful of grapefruit juice , orange juice , and apple juice .
These drinks , especially consumed in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins , if taken together with some lifesaving drugs may alter their absorption , amplifying or diminishing , depending on the case , their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health .
Confirming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit juices whether they are pre-packaged or fresh with certain medicines is David Bailey , professor at the university of Western Ontario in London , who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new warning : a glass of grapefruit juice , orange juice , or apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs , nullifying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients .
Grapefruit juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising , up to levels thought to be toxic , the effects of some antirhythmic , antibiotic , tranquilising , antihistaminic , and neurological medicines .
DRUGS AT RISK â $ " The very same Italian Drug Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago , alerting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers deriving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is drunk in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Diazepam or Methadone .
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT JUICE â $ " According to experts even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs .
The list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices is very long .
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba , director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan : " Usually , such discoveries are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information slips of medicines .
Therefore , always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear , do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chemist for clarificationsÂ " emphasised the expert from the Ansa Agency .
The Nobel Prize for Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on market models and on the localisation of economic activities .
55 year old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian that teaches at Princeton University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times .
Krugman is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration .
A few months after the attacks of September 2001 , in the days when Enron was going bankrupt , Krugman had forecasted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first , in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States .
A prediction that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the economist's face , but has now been revealed to have been exact .
Â " I am surprised and also a bit annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attentionÂ " , declared Krugman towards the end of 2002 .
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi , of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank , Krugman is an " economist of great valueÂ " , but also an orator with a " very aggressive style , particularly critical of the excesses in liberalism of the Bush administrationÂ " .
Open Office , here is the third edition of the " anti-MicrosoftÂ " package .
Today sees the release of Openoffice.org 3.0 , the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users , from domestic to home users , from professionals to public administration , as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office .
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunteer developers , with SUN Microsystem supervising at their backs , the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various novelties : to the welcome screen and to a revisited , less Spartan user interface , are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF ( Open Document Format ) 1.2 , the latest ISO version standard .
Attention was also placed on interoperability with the Office 2007 suite , Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension ( . docx , . xlsx , . pptx ) .
Interesting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of PowerPoint presentations , useful for example for sending them via email , or the possibility of importing a PDF file into the graphics module , maintaining the original appearance of the page .
Always on the same track , it is possible to create " hybrid PDF " documents , that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor .
Collaboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved : in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously , avoiding conflicts on the modifications , in the word processor , each users is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision .
Some companies are also working on porting some of the functionalities of OpenOffice onto the Web ( on the cloud ) , and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product .
The Italian version is available for download at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday .
Besides for Windows and Mac OS , as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system .
On request the installation cd can be sent to your home or workplace .
And if the gimmick of free could be a driving force for the diffusion into houses , it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools .
And there are even institutions that offer training services , consultancy , and assistance , ideal small to medium enterprises , which could create more business opportunities .
Open Office is composed of five main modules : Writer , for onscreen typing corresponding to Word ; Calc , the spreadsheet application aiming at substituting Excel ; Impress , for presentations in emulation of Powerpoint ; Dbase , as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that consents working on databases ; Draw , is the graphic module .
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads , and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand , with the release of the new version it is probable that the predicted figure could even be exceeded .
Even Kohl tested positive , it is the fourth case of doping
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France : it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl , of the team Gerolsteiner , third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt .
Reporting the news is the daily newspaper L'Equipe .
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth cyclist tested positive to Cera , the third generation EPO , after the Italians Riccardo RiccÃ ² and Leonardo Piepoli , and the German Stefan Schumacher , also from the Gerolsteiner team .
The analysis of the blood samples from Kohl form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry .
If the counter-analysis confirm the tests as positive to Cera , the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-year canonical disqualification .
Confirming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation Epo is the French anti-doping agency's chief , Pierre Bordry who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results .
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the finalist podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans , also winning the polka-dotted shirt of the best grimpeur .
IMMIGRANTS : NEW YORK IS WONDERING , IS ITALY RACIST ?
Italy " from a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants " reluctantly received .
Is this transforming the â $  Belpaese ' into a nation of racists ? This is what is being questioned in a long article in the New York Times , which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of biscuits .
This case proves what the New York Times calls the " northern paradox " : the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is " most integration and most work " but also where there is " the highest anti-immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League " .
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also cited the incidents of intolerance in Milan , Parma , Rome , Ciampino , and Castel Volturno .
Not only .
Even the new legislation from the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in climate in Italy .
A trend that has been highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic " Giorgio Napolitano who meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism " .
Students victims of high rents up to 900 Euro for a room
The rent market for university students does not know crises .
According to the latest investigation by SUNIA , the tenants ' syndicate , renting a single room could cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan , 700 in Florence , 650 in Naples , 600 in Rome .
" The phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend ; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain â $ " explains the executive from the Research Office of SUNIA , Laura Mariani â $ " in these cities the strong demand by the students has distorted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents " .
In the majority of cases the rent-offers contain a series of violations : freestyle contracts , unregistered , without rent limits , connected subleases .
According to SUNIA special intervention is necessary that , through a revision of the taxes imposed , the prices could be cooled down .
Looking at the details of the investigation , one can see that in Milan , for a bed-space in the Brianza zone , 450 Euro are required ; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 ( Black Band zone ) , to an average price of 800 ( Lambiate zone , Udine and Fiera ) , and on to a maximum of 900 ( Victoria zone ) .
In Florence a bed-space costs on average 350/400 Euro , a room approximately 700 .
In Bologna , where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university , 250/280 Euro are required for a bed-space in a double room , and from 370 to 500 for a single .
In Rome in the zone near the central universities ( San Lorenzo , Piazza Bologna ) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room , 450 Euro for a bed-space in a double room .
Slightly lower prices ( 550 Euro for a single room ) in areas close to the other universities ( Ostiense and CinecittÃ ) .
Savings are only possible by moving to the suburbs : 300 Euro for a bed-space and 450 for a single in areas such as Prenestrina , Centocelle and similar places .
In Naples 300/450 Euro are required for a bed-space , for a single room one spends 400 to 600 Euro , with the highest prices found in the Policlinico , Vomero , and Colli Aminei areas .
In Bari for a bed-space 250/350 Euro are required , at least 350 for a single .
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms , but they have a higher impact on the local economy .
In cities where renting to non-EU students is a more frequent phenomenon , such as Perugia , there is a further anomaly : the increase of about 25/30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students .
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso , cities cancel historical theatres
Historical cinematographic theatres close in favour of Multiplex .
" A city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city , it's like a face without eyes " .
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore efficaciously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns .
The sidelining process of the cinemas , with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres within the central areas of the city , is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime .
Frequently , it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear , " it is as if a friend is lost , an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memoriesÂ " , observes the director of New Cinema Paradise , the film that twenty years ago gave Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes , and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which , perhaps , has been lost forever .
The numbers provided by Anec , the main cinema-operators association , speak clearly : within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop , and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities : 10 less in Florence , 9 in Milan , Naples , Bologna , and Rome , 6 less in Turin , 5 in Palermo .
Among the regions most badly hit by the closures , Emilia-Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-hall cinemas lost , followed by Tuscany ( 44 ) , and by Lombardy ( 41 ) .
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most responsible for their disappearance , these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered : 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years , 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna .
Â " The Italian business has developed in an irrational wayÂ " observes Paolo Protti , Anec's president , " it's useful that new structures are built but it's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed , because once a theatre in a city closes , not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes .
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators : the previous debit by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro .
It's disgraceful , from the ethical and from the moral point of view , that the government does not respect the existent laws .
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are requiredÂ " .
An interesting example is that of Bologna , the first Italian city that , concerned by the closures , has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec , the first of its kind in Italy , to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts .
Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility : the spectators can enter in the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks .
Â " It's an initiative which I likeÂ " observes Giuseppe Tornatore " and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures .
It's certain though , that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex , traditional theatres have also to improve the sound and image quality , because the public nowadays is more demanding .
The defence of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important : the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema , the place of my infancy and adolescence , was the spark that convinced me to create " New Cinema Paradiso " , on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years .
I have been living in Rome for 25 years , and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now , there where I have experienced many shared emotions , I turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dustÂ " .
Ties between politics and â $  ndrangheta arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed towards conforming municipal interests with those of the Piromalli gang " .
The accusations that the magistrates of the Calabrese Anti-mafia Office direct against the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone , and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli , who have been arrested this morning for external contest with mafia association , are very serious .
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli , the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration offices , and his nephew - a lawyer , namesake of the boss , already condemned for mafia-style criminal association , condemned to repay 10 million euro .
" In contempt of all judicial and moral rules , and common sense " , write the public prosecutors , the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer Piromalli .
" In this way , it was allowed for the gang â $ " the judges write â $ " to officially penetrate inside the municipality easing the already vast possibilities of controlling and directing the public administration " .
The president of the Calabrese local council Agazio Loiero does not hide that " collusions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous " within his region : " there are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others , where collusion is almost inevitable .
However , there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the ` ndrangheta , heroes who remain clean " .
This morning's arrests follow those in July with which the police announced to have beheaded the Piromalli gang .
At the end of last April , the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991 , and always for presumed conditioning between organised crime and local administration , local politicians had been relieved from duties of administration of the municipality .
Giorgio Dal Torrione , the mayor of UDC at the time of the dissolution , had been elected head of a centre-right coalition , after the May 2006 ballot .
He made a scandal out of it when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council .
He brought in cause the then vice-minister of the Interior Marco Minniti accusing him of having plotted everything for political motives , however the judges , in the arrest warrant signed this morning , have explained that the Piromalli gang had even arrived at asking for the variation of the A3 project .
From the interceptions ordered on Dal Torrione , writes the public prosecution , has emerged " a willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur , representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli , aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang " .
When energy is born from the waves the big come into play
It's an immense body , that occupies 70 % of the planet's surface and now the big , international energy companies are discovering it .
Waves , currents , tides are the new renewable sources being eyed , and subjected to attempts of development , by colossi such as Chevron .
The possibility of extracting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70's , coinciding with the first oil crisis , research was intensified .
When the oil prices went down , around 1980 , the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside , but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector .
The World Energy Council ( WEC ) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas ' undulating motion .
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations .
And then there would be the currents and the tides .
Colossi on the attack .
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis , which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal .
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step .
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these , there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy .
" Chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy â $ " a spokesperson for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal â $ " and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us " .
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission , necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska .
This is a significant sign , especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling .
Besides Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc . Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far , even though they are not known in detail , indicate according to the observers an increasing interest .
Technology to be made ready .
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy , marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact .
Till now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the ecosystem .
To produce energy on a large scale , however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented .
And the choices are varied : Ocean Power , for example , uses a system of buoys connected between themselves .
The thrust of the waves , which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters .
The pressure turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator .
The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables .
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned , waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation .
Verdant Power , on the other hand , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River .
The water movement when there are the sea tides makes the fans of the turbines go round , creating a rotary motion that powers a generator .
Verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy .
After the waves , the tides .
Particular interest , declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute , is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides .
Even though it is an intermittent phenomenon , the tide is more predictable than the wind , the sun , or the waves , and so is more reliable as a source of energy .
It's exactly on tidal energy that states such as New York , Maine , and Alaska , together with others that overlook the coast , have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009 .
