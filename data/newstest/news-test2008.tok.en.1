Congress approves the transposition of Mifid that took place on November 1st
Alongside its parliamentary proceedings , that ended today with the partial voting of the Congress on the amendments incorporated to the project in the Senate , the government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law , with the aim of coming in force before the year ends .
The representatives of different groups agreed in emphasizing the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree the best legislation for guaranteeing the protection of the investors and regulating in detail the organizations activity so that the markets work efficiently .
The Mifid , which amends the Securities Market Act , involves the modernization of financial markets , while it strengthens the investor protection , improving the supervisory powers of the ComisiÃ ³ n Nacional del Mercado de Valores ( CNMV ) and encourages cooperation among the various supervisors of the European Union .
The new regulations will grant financial advisory services to specialized companies as well as to natural or legal individuals , and creates a new type of financial advisory companies ( ESIS ) , the financial advisory companies ( AFI ) , that include stock firms , brokers , and the portfolio management firms .
In addition , it extends the number of systems available for the execution of financial operations , so included in the regulation are the secondary markets , the multilateral trading systems , and the internalization systems of orders , these will compete with the current stock market managers .
The law also requires investment services companies to disclose to the market the key details of their business profile , risk exposure and forms of risk management , and to keep a registry of all their operations to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV .
In their passage through the Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress , several modifications were introduced , most notably securitised debts should be considered as a " complex " financial instrument due to its high risk for the investor , which has been demonstrated by what happened with the high risk American mortgages debts ( subprime ) .
In addition , the transposition took advantage of the directive to legally define the functions that can develop graduates in Economics and Finance in 30 years after the decree approbation in 1977 , that delimits the professional functions reserved to professional economists .
For its part , the Senate promoted the creation of new roles in the financial sector , such as the financial advisor , who will work for hire or reward , not require SEC approval and will be able to provide his services and marketing products brokerage to customers at various investment firms at the same time .
The harmonized IPC increases five tenths in November to 4.1 % .
This indicator , that later serves Eurostat to incorporate in the inflation rate calculation in the European Union , provides a prediction of how Spanish prices would evolve during November .
Its publication corresponds with Eurostat and the European Central bank ( BCE ) policy to offer high quality , timely data comparable with the ones produced in the United States .
This advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used by the Consumer Price Index Harmonized , but using different methods of statistical modelling to account for information which isn't available at the moment of its publication .
INE recalled that the information provided by the indicator is only an example , it need not necessarily coincide with the final data , which will be announced next December 14 .
" IPC will continue at relatively high levels " .
The second vice-president and Economy minister , Pedro Solbes , has stated that the IPC increase to 4.1 % in November is a " temporary figure " , but at the same time expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at " relatively high " levels for the next months .
In any case Solbes has emphasized in the Congress corridors that " although the figure is not good " Spanish inflation differential with respect to the monetary union continues to be " more or less " the same as in recent years .
Also explained that November " has been less of a surprise " than in the previous month , when the Government did not count on such a high increase .
" We expected a figure of around 4 % " , recognized the Economy minister with respect to the advance data today .
Virgin plans to make with Northern Rock 42,000 euros million in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50 % to 12,000 million pounds ( 16,800 million euros ) since it went in crisis in the middle of September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England .
At the time it needed deposits of over 25,000 million pounds , a figure that has been progressively falling in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the guarantee of the one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis .
Virgin , that would rename the organization to its financial trademark Virgin Money , needs to get around a quarter of revenues in British banks that are deposited in next the three years to obtain those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the objective of 30,000 million .
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson , known for his showy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom , intends spending 50 million pounds ( about 70 million euros ) annually on publicity and marketing research to achieve his purposes .
Northern Rock named this week the partnership of Virgin , which includes three other companies , as its favourite to rescue it from bankruptcy .
Detained the Totana's mayor for a presumed plot of city-planning corruption
Today , early in the morning , the Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana ( Popular Party ) for his alleged connection with the city-planning corruption plot uncovered this week .
Also arrested was a secretary of the consortium and the head of the Municipal Police .
Jose Martinez Andreo , who last May was replaced by Juan Morales , current popular deputy , and then alderman of the municipality , and according to investigation sources consulted by the Chain SER , could be leader of this plot .
Agents continue registering the municipal dependants and the Urban Council and more arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours .
In addition , the lawyer Juan Morales has been named as the main suspect of the city-planning corruption plot uncovered in the beginning of this week .
As reported yesterday the Chain SER , the lawyer of the Popular deputy Juan Morales , thus witnessed , was arrested leaving the Morales address with important documents related to the plot .
More , the object of the investigation , according to sources of the investigation , is the presumed fees charged by Morales in exchange for facilitating the company/signature of a city-planning agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land .
At the moment , there are eight people detained .
Bono accepts to head the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if won .
The ex - Defence minister JosÃ © Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and General Secretary of the Socialists , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections .
This was announced in a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE , Jose Blanco , and Bono himself , after the meeting that was held this afternoon in the federal seat of the party with Zapatero .
The chief executive has justified the offer to the ex - minister because " it's important to have the best " in political life and Bono " is among the best " .
In addition , it was also pointed out that " it seems " that the Manchego group socialist candidate will preside the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections .
Bono would replace the Congress president Manuel MarÃn , that on 15th November made public his decision of not standing for the next general elections and to abandon his career in politics to dedicate himself to fight against the climatic change in the university level .
The ex - minister has recognized that the Government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago .
In addition , he has indicated that , like the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE gains the elections , they have wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress , in an " act of transparency " .
If he gains office , Bono hopes to turn the House into " the house of respect and not insult or shout " . And make it " more and more visible to the citizens " .
" Sometimes unfortunately it appears that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to be speak with confidence and calmness is the Congress , the Government president on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times " .
Also , he has praised the current president , Manuel MarÃn and " the good work he's doing " and has not wanted to be viewed as already occupying his post , not to fall in what , his adversaries could view as " arrogance " .
Climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against the climatic change , put under merciless persecution by the sceptics of its predictions like those that prioritize other political and social battles , is forced to show an iron determination .
And as leader of the movement and as the president of the Government Zapatero thinks that this fight is more important that the one on Islamic terrorism and proposes to sign a " new contract with the planet " .
That approach forces him to explain why the action , or the inaction , of the Government has contributed decisively to the Spanish heading the UE breach of Kyoto .
Who are the people responsible for the breach , in which sectors have they taken place and why his Government , the contract with the planet , has not avoided it .
In addition , it demands to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish which are the measures that are needed to restrain the climatic change .
Which companies will be affected , which citizen habits will have to be changed , which individual and collective power savings will we be forced to do , what economic consequences will it have .
That is , who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet .
But there has neither been nor will be explanations .
Indeed because someone will have to sacrifice and pay .
Measures against climatic change , the real measures , are unpopular .
Expensive , uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals .
Such as the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE , which close to the election may be dangerous to Zapatero , who has hastened to deny it .
That is , which one is to save the planet without doing anything , with pure propaganda , with slogans devoid of all real consequence .
With impressive phrases , commissions , committees , protocols , new positions .
With contracts with the planet , this man , who neither speaks nor complains nor demands , but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness , is very useful for election campaigns .
Always , if the contract part is limited to being only virtual , and we only pretend to move around by bicycle or to stay fresh with a fan .
Detained the Totana's mayor and the head of the local Police on a presumed plot of city-planning corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana , " popular " Jose Martinez Andreo , the head of the local Police , the secretary of the City council and a hostel businessman on possible city-planning crimes , sources have informed us today .

In addition , two other people were detained but not charged in the summary , that instructs the Totana's number 1 Court .
The six first arrests have gone before the court today .
According to information sources , the previous alderman of Totana and actual autonomic parliamentary of the PP , Juan Morales , is being investigated .

Our Finnish correspondent provided this commentary from yesterday's Helsingin Sanomat , the most important Finnish newspaper ( by the way in head of the PISA report about educative level in the world ) , which refers to what was published on November 18th , the same day in which appeared there a specific criticism to the book of Blackburn :
" The content of Philosophy signature has come to the public attention as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela's school .
To blame for the deaths , a high school student mentioned in his messages works of Plato and Nietzsche .
The Education Advisor and responsible for Philosophy , Pekka Elo , demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that to study Nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes " .

A colleague has passed information over the introduction in the Penal Code of the crimes over downloading from the Internet :
A . The downloading of one song would be a criminal offence carrying a penalty of six months to a year .
However , if you steal from the music store for a value inferior to 400 euros , it is considered simply a misdemeanour ( article 623,1 ) .
B . If you steal from the store up to 1000 euros , the theft already is crime , but the penalty continues being inferior to the one imposed for downloading ( article 234 of the Penal Code ) .
C . If you steal a car and you give it back 40 hours later , the penalty continues being inferior to the one for downloading ( article 244,1 ) .
D . It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the interchange of degraded music .
To participate in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year ( article 154 of the Penal Code ) and the interchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
( article 270 of the Penal Code ) .
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD , according to article 184,2 of the Penal Code .
F . The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors ' authorization carries a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors ( article 186 ) .
Well , if my colleague is right , somebody is stretching the law a bit too far .

My attending physician gave me an article on a rare investigation titled : " Money produces brain activity , mainly if the others receive less ' .
That is , that the feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the workers depends on how much colleagues earn .
A study has been made using magnetic resonance at the University of Bonn , and the results have been published in the last issue of Science .
According to Bernd Weber , author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life & Brain Institute , in Germany : " the hardest activation took place when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed " .
The investigators observed that when both guessed right and received the same payment , the activation was moderate , but if one received double , the activation was greater .
I do not know if this conclusion required as much science .
The public prosecutor of the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been eight years implacably pursuing the war criminals of the Balkans from the public prosecutor's office of the Penal Court for the ex - Yugoslavia , located in The Hague .
Her mandate expires at the end of year and Carla will go with bittersweet flavour , because people responsible for the Srebrenica's slaughter - where 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died , the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , are still at large .
Their names are in the list from which the Swiss documentary , produced by Marcel SchÃ 1/4 pbach , takes its title , " Carla's list " ( 2006 , not released in Spain ) , which has the pace of a police thriller , and follows the work of the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments concerned to strengthen the siege .
Which insurance is good for me ?
The car insurance that covers the driver against possible claims , represents a major expense that would depend on various factors , such as age , sex , length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
Having the car is only the beginning .
Because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model .
First we must be clear what we are talking about .
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured .
This commitment is translated into an insurance contract , which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed premium and in return it is responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of loss .
The premium is the insurance price , which is established considering diverse factors , such as the age , sex , the length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
The insuring companies establish their prices based on the statistics , so that the greater the probability of having an accident is , the greater the premium is .
It is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums , since statistics show that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence .
Also , making use of the statistics , companies have reached the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than celibate drivers .
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency , and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap .
Increasing the frequency increases the probabilities .
There are many variables that the insurers consider when establishing the price of the premium .
It is for this reason , that the driver has to study his situation to choose the insurance that better adjusts his profile .
Presented here are the most significant variables in choosing one or another kind of insurance that , in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured , offers a reasonable price .
People younger than 25 years have diverse disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price , as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership .
Although , to be well insured , it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance , other economic options exist .
The most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any risk , so that they obtain the insurance coverage , but at a price more feasible .
This class of agreement would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps .
" The amount of the costs that contributes the client will be settled based on the value of the premium , that will be higher if this amount is lowered " , specifies Luis Noguera , head of First Europe in Spain , mediator of online insurances .
Another option is an extended third party insurance , so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties , although not to those caused to his own car .
In addition , it would be covered for robbery , fire and the loss of the vehicle .
An advice .
If you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible , since this will be an advantage , being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future .
An advantage is a reduction on the basic tariff of the company .
On the contrary , a penalty is a surcharge on this base tariff .
" Advantages and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits .
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the advantages " , clarifies Noguera .
Once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance , since the accident index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience .
For this reason the most recommendable is to contract a fully comprehensive with tax exemption .
" Normally young people can not take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident , or even when driving " , assures the director in Spain of the European company , to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving , once the " fear of the novice " passes .
Nevertheless , if the client is married but still doesn't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance , as long as his economic situation allows it , clearly .
On the other hand , people married with children are considered by the insurers as the public with accident rate , reason why the premiums will be smaller .
In this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( this being of 300 euros ) , or , when it is had , a high benefit level , a third-party extended as the third life's year of the vehicle .
" They make a more relaxed driver and have a greater spending power to allow the luxury to assume an amount of greater tax exemption " , states Luis Noguera .
For the pensioners a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( being this one of 150 euros ) , or a third party when a high level of advantage is had .
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important , not only because it covers the driver over possible wrecks , but because it represents an important cost , reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation .
The Celtic looking in Milan a point worth eighth
Milan and Celtic are playing on Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they needed to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the " Champions " league , as the Italians are used to be first and the Scots for his sentencing classification .
The Italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in Portugal , while Celtic has nine points , but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar , with six , and that Benfica , which has four , do not overtake it .
These two matches of Group D will be played in one week before the end of the sixth day , since Milan has to play in the Mundial de Clubes in Japan , where they make their debut on the 13 in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final on 16 .
So , this group will be closed before the rest and Giuseppe Meazza seems to expect a tie as the result , but the two teams will try to go for a win , and the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals .
To the Gordon Strachan team could serve even a defeat for classified Shakhtar if not wins , but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the Ukranians pass , who lost last week in Glasgow ( 2-1 ) , but won ( 2-0 ) in another duel live .
Thus , Milanists threaten to make it a bitter night for the Scots , who rely on getting into the quarters for the second time in a row in the restructured Champions League , after they were precisely defeated in this last round by a goal from Kaka in the extended time ( 1-0 ) after 0-0 in the round .
Waiting for the victory of the " rossoneri " will be the Shakhtar to which only the win will do , in the event that Celtic lost both get into quarters to continue in the UEFA .
And as to Benfica , despite being the last one and without any hope of staying in the top European competition , could reach third place with a victory , which play UEFA .
20,000 people in Vancouver attending the first concert of the Spice Girls ' tour .
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver ( Canada ) , in front of 20,000 spectators , their first tour since they dissolved in 2000 .
" Posh Spice " ( Victoria Beckham ) , " Scary Spice " ( Melanie Brown ) , " Baby Spice " ( Emma Bunton ) , " Sporty Spice " ( Melanie Chisholm ) and " Ginger Spice " ( Geri Halliwell ) declared shortly before the concert at the stadium GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting is " brilliant " .
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to witness the concert that included a video which tells the story of the group that was very successful at the end of 1990 .
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that includes their major successes as well as two new songs , " Headlines " and " Voodoo " , which are published by EMI in Spain .
The five members of Spice Girls came out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of ` Posh Spice ' , the British footballer David Beckham .
The athlete was among the public that filled GM Place , despite the fact that due to nervousness Victoria had forbidden it days earlier .
Prior to the start of the show , Victoria Beckham noted that the British star " has not seen our apparel , for nothing , so I am nervous about what he will think about the spectacle . "
" Sporty Spice " whose departure from the group in 1998 " for the differences between us " led the dissolution of the quintet two years later , also expressed nervousness during a meeting with the press , two hours before the start of the show .
" I was scared " .
" I was nervous to see that the world's sense has changed , the feeling about the Spice Girls has changed .
And I thought why not , so I am happy for having taken the decision " said Chisholm about the reunion of the group that she disbanded nine years ago .
The singer also noted that over time , " things have been settled and we still love each other a lot . "
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls acted together for the last time in 1998 .
To begin with , according to CTV television , the group arrived at Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines plane .
Upon their arrival at the airport , waiting for them there was an army of nannies .
Among the five joined seven children .
After the concert in Vancouver , the group will appear in California ( USA ) , San Jose ( December 4th ) and Los Angeles ( December 5th and 7th ) .
In Madrid they will appear on December 23th .
New Russia-Ukraine gas row fears
A fresh gas price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia , raising the risk that Russian exports of the fuel to western Europe may be affected .
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union ( EU ) are piped through Ukraine and any row between the two nations is keenly watched .
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for the gas it will charge Russia higher transit fees .
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states .
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly , Gazprom , try to reach agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008 .
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more as it has agreed to pay up to 50 % extra in 2008 for gas it sources from neighbouring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine having to pay 40 % more for its imports from Gazprom .
" It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the top gas transit states during talks , " Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency .
" The changes in gas prices should no doubt be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit fees [ to western Europe ] via Ukraine . "
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev saw Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006 .
That lead to a knock-on fall in exports to western Europe , which sharply pushed up prices .
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the European Union's supplies .
Russia has the world's largest stocks of gas , but much of it remains under-developed .
As a result , Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations .
NHS ` must check foreign workers '
Scottish NHS boards need to improve criminal records checks for employees outside Europe , a watchdog has said .
The recommendation from Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked with the Glasgow Airport attack in June .
Mr Black also raised concerns that NHS Scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas staff it had .
But his report pointed out other key checks were properly carried out across a sample of five health authorities .
The auditor general looked into staff recruited outside European Economic Area countries , in the wake of the Glasgow Airport attack .
Bilal Abdullah , 28 , an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , was arrested at the airport after a Jeep was driven into the doors of the main terminal building .
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey by video link in October , charged in connection with the suspected car bomb attempts in the UK .
NHS boards are expected to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure they have the qualifications , experience and authorisation to work in the UK .
Although Scots health boards use Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal records checks , the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain such information outside Britain .
The auditor general's report has now said , among other recommendations , that the boards should take on Criminal Records Bureau guidance , which helps employers with checks in several overseas countries .
" Although we found the some of the personnel records had evidence of these checks , this is not done routinely , " stated the report .
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS had a high level of compliance with its own pre-employment screening policies , but added : " Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of overseas NHS staff . "
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was " extremely unlikely " that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees people who might commit future terrorist acts .
" The report suggests that current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver , " he said .
Scottish health authorities said they currently had 1,161 overseas staff , the vast majority of them doctors and nurses .
But the auditor general warned the numbers were likely to be higher , partly because boards had problems identifying which staff were on indefinite leave to remain .
The investigation also found that established check procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , and Lothian were largely being met .
These included passport , work permit and qualification checks .
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for overseas staff in the NHS .
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : " I was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on Glasgow Airport .
She added the Scottish Government , in conjunction with health boards , would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas - it planned to publish next month .

The black-and-white film - which features The Killers , David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack - was shot for just Â # 3m .
But it earned Dutch photographer Corbijn , previously best-known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album , two awards - for best director and best debut director .
Rock music was the focus of another award-winner at the ceremony - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer took the Best Documentary prize .
The best actor gong went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver to a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises .
Ray Winstone , who has a reputation for playing tough guys , picked up the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film .
The 50-year-old , whose films include Scum , Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast , is currently filming Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull .
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award , named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris , who died in 2002 .
" It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney that opened the doors for people like me , " he said .
" I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times .
He's my type of guy , a great actor of the time , I 'm really honoured . "
The independent film awards , known as the Bifas , are selected by a panel which included filmmakers , actors and festival organisers .
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis , Ken Loach , Ewan McGregor , Samantha Morton , Bill Nighy , Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom .
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 over terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for involvement in cells planning an imminent attack on an oil installation , as well as attacks on clerics and security forces .
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles .
Sympathisers of al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against the monarchy , an ally of the United States , since 2003 , following the invasion of Iraq .
A cell of eight militants led by a foreign resident planned an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province , the TV report said .
Saudi Arabia has been building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect installations after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006 on the world's largest oil processing plant , at Abqaiq .
The report , citing an interior ministry statement , said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by an " expert in launching missiles " , who had slipped into the country .
It said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom .
Another 22 of those detained were reported to be plotting to assassinate clerics and security forces .
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis heading to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government , which is considered heretical by hardline Sunni Saudis .
Al-Qaeda militants regard many clerics in Saudi Arabia as having been co-opted by the authorities into supporting the policies of the royal family , which dominates government .
Militants - boosted by calls from Osama bin Laden , the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader , to target the pro-western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential compounds , government buildings and energy-sector installations .
" This was a very large effort by security forces over the past ... five months , " an interior ministry spokesman told state television .
The arrests also included a " media cell " of 16 in Medina , which aimed to promote " takfiri thinking " - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates .
Those arrested also included 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants .
Climate on Venus may be glimpse of future for Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live , scientists said yesterday .
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft show the planet is even more like a wayward twin of Earth than was previously realised .
Venus is the Earth's closest planetary neighbour .
The two worlds are about the same size and occupy similar orbits , although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
Billions of years ago , Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth and may even have been habitable , scientists now believe .
But a runaway carbon dioxide greenhouse effect , atmospheric erosion by solar radiation , and a slower rotation rate sent Venus down a very different development path .
Today the planet is stripped of water , has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms .
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe , which has been studying the planet for a year , offer a sobering view of how Earth might develop given catastrophic changes to its climate .
Professor Fred Taylor , of Oxford University's department of physics , one of the Venus Express mission leaders , said : " It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from the Earth when the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar .
" Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth , possibly with a habitable environment , billions of years ago . "
` Enriched uranium ' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material , reported to be enriched uranium , was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday .
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was being examined .
He would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $ 1 million ( Â # 480,000 ) .
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said he did not feel it was dignified for presidential candidates to take questions from a snowman .
Nonetheless , the Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agreed to face a YouTube debate , in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates .
None of the questions aired on the evening of Wednesday November 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate .
But the questions , and answers , this time reflected much about the state of the Republican party heading into next year's election .
It is not known how exactly the producers of CNN , which co-sponsored the debate , chose which YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates .
But the first half-hour of the debate , the longest dedicated to any single issue , focused on immigration .
The subject is one of the most potent topics for Republicans .
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn up a dial when they heard things that pleased them : the broadcaster noted spikes of approval when the candidates talked tough on borders .
The harshest and longest exchange of the evening came between Rudy Giuliani , the national front-runner , and Mr Romney , who has nudged ahead in the crucial early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake a reputation that he was easy on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked Mr Romney , accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house .
The two sparred particularly fiercely as questioners asked if any candidate would support an " amnesty " ( giving illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship ) .
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter , a Californian congressman , and Tom Tancredo , a congressman from Colorado , managed to get digs in on the subject .
Neither man has a prayer at the nomination , but both remain in the race perhaps because they started beating the immigration drum earlier and harder than others .
At least on immigration the candidates , broadly , share the same views : tougher borders , intolerance for illegal migrants .
This topic , along with fears of toxic toys from China or other worries about the outside world , helps Republicans forget , or minimise , the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives .
But the debate grew distinctly awkward when other topics were raised .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past .
John McCain and Mr Romney debated whether waterboarding should be considered as torture .
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible .
This led Mr Giuliani to stumble towards the position that while the Bible was his favourite book , he perhaps did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee - now , against all expectations , in first place in a recent poll from Iowa thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary .
When pressed whether Jesus would be in favour , he got a laugh saying Jesus was too smart to run for office .
The race remains unusually wide open .
Mr Huckabee's surge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at Wednesday's debate .
These two have surged from the bottom because the party's two wings can not yet agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates .
In 1980 and 2000 , a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness and winks to both of the party's wings .
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear .
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another hole to fall into ; his way out of it remains the same
As British political scandals go , this one is not particularly juicy .
No honours seem to have been sold , no politician's Parisian hotel bills picked up , no extramarital toes sucked .
But the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to Britain's governing Labour Party of more than Â # 650,000 ( $ 1.3 m ) over four years under other people's names , and that the party failed to report it , is one the embattled Gordon Brown could well have done without .
Two months ago , when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election , stupidly insulting Britons ' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision , the hope was that he would provide sturdy , efficient government .
Instead , as Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats ' increasingly witty stand-in leader , put it , the once feared Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr Bean .
The cack-handed rescue of Northern Rock , a troubled bank , showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire .
Ill-thought-out proposals to change the tax code have drawn business groups together against the government .
The tax authority's loss of 25m people's personal details revealed unimaginable administrative bungling .
A trio of retired generals launched a mutiny in the Lords , protesting against cuts in military spending : being armed-forces minister is , they claimed , a part-time job .
Now there are the multifaceted donations from David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labour's general secretary ( and its previous head of compliance ) , has already resigned .
None of this means that Mr Brown is headed irrevocably for the exit .
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern .
People neither like nor trust politicians , but usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over .
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things , and may not even be around for long , that suspension is over : the civil service starts leaking ; cabinet ministers start briefing ; the press looks for bad-news stories ; and government becomes defensive and unfocused .
In one way , Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult , because unlike other political leaders he can not claim to be a new broom .
Much though he would like to disown Tony Blair , he was his senior lieutenant .
The problems to do with Northern Rock and the tax-authority records , for instance , are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer .
And even when he was not directly involved in Blairish mishaps - such as the long " cash for peerages " inquiry into political-party funding - voters may well assume he was .
Yet Mr Brown's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks .
The gaffes are not as appalling as the Tories are making out .
As with Mr Bean , no one has died , or been swindled outright .
And the remedy , painful though it may be , is to provide what Mr Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised : reliable , sound and slightly brutal government .
The new fuss about political donations is a good example .
The Garboesque Mr Abrahams , who compares his donations to his charitable giving , says he wished no public recognition for his benevolence .
That may be so , but the decision was not his to make .
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason : the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land .
Mr Watt , who says he knew of Mr Abrahams's arrangement but not that it was illegal , will obviously face some close questioning ; so will Jon Mendlesohn , Labour's chief fund-raiser who was told about the dodgy donations in October .
But so far Mr Brown is not involved : there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these convolutions , even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June .
So far the prime minister has done half the job .
He was quick to condemn his party's breach of the law , but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool , a committee of inquiry into the matter - led , for good measure , by a retired bishop and a judge .
In this case , the " lessons to be learned " are not complicated .
If the law has been broken , it is a matter for the police .
Besides , there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do , such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life , which has been without one for six months , and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political-party funding .
That would require hard-up Labour to co-operate with the Tories and perhaps give up its special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partisan like Mr Brown .
But he should face some partisan facts .
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls ; he has two years to win back voters ; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence .
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting America's credit-card market ?
When there is blood in the water , it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly .
Now that America's housing market is ailing , predators have their sights on the country's credit-card market .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that credit-card losses could reach $ 99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other forms of consumer credit .
Signs of strain are clearly visible .
There are rises in both the charge-off and delinquency rates , which measure the share of balances that are uncollectible or more than 30 days late respectively .
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $ 1.4 billion charge in its American consumer-finance business , partly because of weakness among card borrowers .
It is too early to panic , though .
Charge-offs and delinquencies are still low .
According to Moody's , a rating agency , the third-quarter delinquency rate of 3.89 % was almost a full percentage point below the historical average .
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors .
A change in America's personal-bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings , which in turn account for a big chunk of credit-card losses ; the number of filings ( and thus charge-off rates ) would be rising again , whether or not overall conditions for borrowers were getting worse .
The industry also reports solid payment rates , which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month .
And confidence in credit-card asset-backed securities is pretty firm despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance .
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup , a research firm , predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25 % higher than last year .
Direct channels of infection between the subprime-mortgage crisis and the credit-card market certainly exist : consumers are likelier to load up on credit-card debt now that home-equity loans are drying up .
But card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values , so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers ' creditworthiness .
They may even work to issuers ' advantage .
The incentives for consumers to keep paying the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan ; card debt rises higher up the list of repayment priorities as a result .
Card issuers are also able to respond much more swiftly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders are , by changing interest rates or altering credit limits .
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid repricing of assets .
" We are not going to wake up one day and totally revalue the loans , " says Gary Perlin , Capital One's chief financial officer .
If a sudden subprime-style meltdown in the credit-card market is improbable , the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real .
If lower house prices and a contraction in credit push America into recession , the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future .
Keep watching for those dorsal fins .
British Bankers Plead Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers who were set to go to trial for their roles in a fraudulent scheme with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty Wednesday .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly colluding with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at their employers ' expense .
They were set to go on trial in January .
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. , each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud .
The three former executives at Greenwich NatWest , a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC , became a cause celebre in Britain throughout extradition proceedings that lasted two years .
In the United States , their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's 2001 collapse .
Charges initially filed against them in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was a target of the government's investigation into Enron's downfall .
The indictment against the bankers -- dubbed the " NatWest Three " -- alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide , Michael Kopper .
Greenwich NatWest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow , who was the architect of a myriad of fraudulent Enron schemes that helped fuel its spiral into bankruptcy proceedings .
In early 2002 , the bank had valued its interest in the subsidiary at zero , but the three British men knew it actually had significant value .
A company under Kopper's control purchased the bank's interest in the subsidiary for $ 1 million .
The bankers paid Kopper $ 250,000 for an interest in this company .
According to the indictment , Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $ 20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary .
But the $ 20 million actually went to the British bankers , Fastow and others .
The bankers got $ 7.3 million while Fastow , Kopper and others skimmed about $ 12.3 million , according to the indictment .
In January 2004 , Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's collapse .
The British trio was arrested three months later .
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana .
Kopper is serving a three-year , one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana .
Each of the three British men have been free on $ 1 million bonds that required them to live in the United States pending trial .
Enron , once the nation's seventh-largest company , crumbled into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or make failing ventures appear profitable .
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs , more than $ 60 billion in market value and more than $ 2 billion in pension plans .
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse .
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years .
Lay's convictions for conspiracy , fraud and other charges were wiped out after he died of heart disease last year .
Not Down and Out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 airplane , fitted with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles , starts at $ 54 million .
But that is small change to some of the Russian rich .
" It seats up to 18 passengers , " said Dan Firer , a Gulfstream representative .
" But none of them ask for that many seats because it is for a private family or a company president . "
Mr. Firer was manning the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair , a four-day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital .
In addition to Gulfstream , over 200 other luxury purveyors had set up display stands , hoping to interest newly moneyed Russians in everything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worthy of 50 Cent .
Mr. Firer warily eyed a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his .
" That's a nice car , but it is nickels and dimes compared to us , " he said .
" After the United States , Russia is the second-biggest market for private aircraft . "
Fueled by an oil boom , the Russian capital seems as awash in cash as Dallas was in its heyday .
" We went through the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans came into giant wealth and flocked to Europe , where they were viewed as materialistic , " said Marshall Goldman , a senior scholar at the Davis Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University .
Like the Saudi high rollers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s , Russians are emerging as the world's most visible free spenders .
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the Klondike .
Elsewhere in Moscow this week , a conference on the luxury industry has drawn Donatella Versace , Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault , the chairman of LVMH , to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods to markets like Russia .
( The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune , which is owned by The New York Times Company . )
Russia has 53 billionaires worth a total of $ 282 billion , according to the Forbes list of the richest people .
In addition , the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires who are collectively worth $ 670 billion , according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research , a think tank here .
( The World Bank says that in 2005 , 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level . )
" There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that is why we are all here , " said Nicole Marais , a sales and marketing representative for David Morris , the London jeweller .
She was attending the fair for the first time in conjunction with the brand's Russian distributor , the Soho Jewelry Group .
" The women are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune . "
Wandering the halls Sunday night , dressed in evening attire , two real estate agents , Evgenia Yumatova , 21 , and Svetlana Turovtsova , 26 , described both themselves and their clients as millionaires .
" I was looking at the cars and I 'm trying to decide between the Infiniti , the Mercedes and the Porsche , " said Ms. Yumatova , who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers .
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the nouveaux riches , the type of brand-driven Russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades , platinum penknives , MÃ ¶ venpick ice cream , custom pool tables , apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears .
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( $ 44.57 ) .
" Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best , " said Mr. Gijrath , who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft , in front of a wall-size re-creation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue tile .
" Of course , Russians are more interested in bling-bling . "
Indeed , vendors here said that Russians with old money ( 10 to 15 years is old , by Russian standards ) have already moved on from flashy logos to the kind of understated limited-edition brands that would not market themselves at a trade show .
Still , several thousand people , whether cash millionaires , emissaries of millionaires or just tourists , thronged the halls every day .
And some of them were buying .
On the first night of the show last Thursday , Roman Ershov , the general manager of King Koil beds here , said he had sold two $ 70,000 mattress sets made of silk , cashmere and cotton , interwoven with gold threads .
Also on the first night , Mikhail Lyubiumov , the sales manager for A1 Moto , a company that outfits high-end cars with high-end alarm systems , said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche , for $ 170,000 , to a Russian millionaire .
By Sunday afternoon , Andrei Karapetian , the president of L.A. Connection , a company that customizes luxury cars , said he had sold three car grilles , resembling interlinked chain bracelets , for Rolls-Royce Phantoms , at $ 55,000 each .
He showed a reporter a car wheel , designed for a Russian casino owner , with spokes that he had encrusted with coloured Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
The cost : $ 22,000 for a set of four .
" The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made out of cubic zirconium , is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels , " Mr. Karapetian said .
" He is going to keep it in his 30 - or 40-car garage . "
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich , Mr. Karapetian said the phrase " Russian millionaire " did not convey much exclusivity at the moment , given the surge in real estate prices here .
" If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago , you are probably already a millionaire , at least on paper if not in cash , " he said .
" There are more of them than you think . "
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand run by Alliance Continental , a Russian asset management firm .
The company had erected four red British-style telephone booths , stuffed with piles of counterfeit million-dollar greenbacks .
Azad Karryev , the company's marketing manager , said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair .
Passers-by stopped to toss piles of money around , ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth , or just to pocket a couple of million .
" You see , in Moscow , everyone can feel himself a millionaire , " Mr. Karryev said .
Botched Surgery Suspected in a Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the big plate-glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance pulled up to the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue .
Soon , there was a police patrol car .
And then there was another .
" Then I saw the medical examiner's van pull up , " Mr. Livingston , a supervisor at the restaurant , said on Wednesday .
" That's when I knew somebody was gone . "
The authorities would learn that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo , 41 , an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department .
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon , whom the police did not identify , working in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue .
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death , and are hopeful that toxicology tests , the results of which might not be available for weeks , will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of the Newark police .
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director , Garry F. McCarthy , since September 2006 , and her voice was familiar to many in the department .
" She was loyal , hard-working and tenacious , " Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday .
" She was my pit bull .
She would protect me . "
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo , a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission , and that she leaves two sons , 14 and 11 , and a stepdaughter .
Eileen Walsh , a spokeswoman for the Union County prosecutor , Theodore J. Romankow , said that detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as the result of an unlicensed surgical procedure .
" That's one of the possibilities , " Ms. Walsh said .
" It's an ongoing investigation . "
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on Nov.
21 and found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa .
She was pronounced dead at the scene .
More than a week has gone by , and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house , who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro .
Ms. Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro had been interviewed by the authorities .
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical office .
On Wednesday , no one answered the door at Ms. Castro's home , where a withered rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked in the back .
A blue drum labelled " Ethyl Vanillin " - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in a carport , next to a door that led to the basement .
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks off to one side .
Mr. McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department , Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city's insular and rough-hewn political culture .
" She would say , ` You 've got to watch out for this one or that one , ' " he said .
" She was always here when I got here , and she was always here when I left .
It was embarrassing . "
Hopes that Fed will cut rates lead to world stock market surge
Shares leapt on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve will try to calm credit conditions with further interest rate cuts were boosted by soothing comments from the US central bank's vice-chairman .
Stock markets surged in London , New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn , No 2 to Ben Bernanke , the Fed's Chairman , said that policymakers must be " flexible and pragmatic " in responding to continued stress in financial markets .
In a clear effort to reassure fretful markets amid signs of resurgent credit strains , Mr Kohn said that recent turbulence had " partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of September and in October " .
Should the elevated turbulence persist , it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses , he said .
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Fed stands ready to step in with fresh injections of capital into US markets , and possible further interest rate cuts , to stabilise credit conditions .
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street amid more bad news on the US economy , as sales of US homes hit a record low in October .
The fallout from financial turmoil was emphasised by an announcement from Bear Stearns , the investment bank , that it will cut 650 jobs , or 4 per cent of its global workforce , in a round of cost-cutting to offset heavy losses from its losing bets on the US sub-prime home loans sector .
Only 20 of those posts are expected to go in London , where the bank employs 1,500 people .
In New York , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 331 points , or 2.55 per cent , to close at 13,289.40 , while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent .
In London , the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points , or 2.7 per cent , to close at 6,306.2 , adding more than Â # 39 billion to the value of Britain's blue-chip companies .
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 per cent , and France's CAC40 was up 2.3 per cent .
Earlier , the re-emergence of credit stress in the markets was high-lighted after strong demand in an auction of three-month funds by the European Central Bank saw those loaned to Europe's commercial banks at a hefty 4.7 per cent , the highest rate since April 2001 .
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and ECB and inject extra funds into money markets in London mounted as credit strains saw three-month " Libor " rates for lending between UK banks pushed to their highest since late September , at 6.59 per cent , after a steady climb since November 12 .
England faced with judgment call over the claims of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas , each almost as difficult as the other .
Who should bat at No 6 for England in Kandy this weekend , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , no less relevant in a wider context than the first Test against Sri Lanka , who should make the decision ?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney , the chairman of selectors who is on borrowed time under that particular title at least , is here to help Peter Moores , the head coach , and Michael Vaughan , the captain , to decide and because the desk of Hugh Morris , the England managing director , is starting to fill up with applications to become national selector , if not a part-time one .
Whoever does not get the sixth batting place will be unlucky , but life is often unfair and sport certainly is .
It is never easy to pin down what makes one man reach the top of his profession while another never gets beyond a lower level , sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability .
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult , requiring judgment that always has to be subjective in the end .
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up ?
Is it fair on Shah if he does ?
The same might well be asked in another field of whether , say , John Edwards or " Tubby " Banerjee , both bright young executives with good degrees who know the business well , should be promoted to the board : there is only room for one of them .
Who is to say what the right level is for a cricketer , unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one ?
Figures , naturally , have a large bearing on decisions , but so do opportunities .
Within a team , a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one-day cricketer .
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated .
There were many who did better last season , for example , than James Anderson , who looks certain to play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself fit and bowls like the wind in the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average , but both have had their moments at the highest level and hope for more of them .
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can be only a matter of opinion .
The choice might break or make either man's career , or it might make little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka , Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , but it was Paul Collingwood , struggling to establish himself at the same time , who came through to become a substantial Test cricketer and , despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia , may still be underestimated .
The probability is that Graveney , Vaughan and Moores , after one more discussion in the wake of today's net session at the Asgiriya Stadium , will follow their conservative instincts and plump for Shah's greater experience over Bopara's youthful exuberance .
There are arguments for both .
In Shah's favour are his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Bombay , 32 first-class hundreds to only six by Bopara , who , at 22 , is seven years younger , and an excellent record against spin bowling .
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's , his home venue as a Middlesex player , and that , plus the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was fit to reclaim his place for the next match , seems to have taken from his batting some of the Ã © lan that was evident in Bombay .
By contrast , the Essex all-rounder has joie de vivre in spades .
He is fazed by nothing on a cricket field and his attitude off it was summed up when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition day for England's car sponsor , Volkswagen .
He suffered minor injuries and , presumably , shock , but the first thing that he did was to pull out his Vodafone ( also sponsored , of course ) and phone Alastair Cook , his team-mate , who was watching from a distance , to say , with excitement : " Did you see that ? "
Bopara is much the better fielder , he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some effect here on pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill .
Choosing the right man is one thing , choosing the right moment another .
Perhaps that is the real art of selection .
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance now , which is not to say that Shah might not excel if , as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest , it is he who plays here this weekend .
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria started arriving in Baghdad yesterday , spewing out exiles who had run out of cash or visa extensions and others who hoped that the city was returning to normality .
Some had even come back to fight the militants who drove them from their homes .
At the Mansour bus station , even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people in an official government convoy of a dozen buses , the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport .
" I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad , " Sabah al-Qubaisi , a Sunni doctor , said .
" I returned today because of what I saw on TV and what I keep reading in the newspapers , about what happened to Baghdad and how it was safe now .
They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people , " he said , referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr , who has ordered his forces to stand down for the moment .
Qassim al Atwani , a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amariyah , returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working .
His Shia neighbours in Amariyah telephoned to tell him that a local US-backed militia force had helped to drive al-Qaeda out from their bastion in the west of the capital , and urged him to return .
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up to fight al-Qaeda .
He had come back to fight .
" Two days ago , some of my friends called me and told me they started an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they need me and my boys ' support .
That's way I returned today , " Sabaah Alu Obeidi , 62 , said .
Many spoke of being lured by the increased calm in the capital since the US troop surge and growth of local " concerned citizens groups " , armed and working with the US military to defend their neighbourhoods .
But more spoke of being forced home by visa woes and dwindling capital in Damascus , where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years .
Salaam al-Samarrai , a 51-year-old father of three , gave voice to common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki , the Shia prime minister , had asked the Syrian Government to impose visa restriction on the refugees to force people to return .
More than two and half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads .
" We were OK until al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the Government to stop giving the Iraqis visas , to force them to go back to Iraq , " the Sunni pensioner said .
" I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burnt down my house after I left . "
Part of the reason for the drop in violence is that Sunnis have been purged from Shia areas and vice versa , creating many places where tensions are lower .
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions again and lead to fighting .
Tiny Saarland , Good Education
The smallest German federal state is leading the field in vocational training , and distinguishes itself through the international character of its university-level institutions in particular .
In one field of education , however , Saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country .
" Yesterday I met someone not from Saarland , and I had to point out for the 50th time that we are not Frenchmen " - with this self-deprecating advertising slogan , the smallest German federal state celebrates its 50th birthday .
At the same time , France and Luxemburg play major roles in Saarland's educational system , which , according to a so-called education monitor of the German Business Institute ( IW ) , Cologne , ranks fifth .
The university-level institutions ' cooperation with the neighbouring countries , for instance , is part of a tradition .
SaarbrÃ 1/4 cken's university was founded by the French in 1948 .
Even now , students there have the opportunity to obtain bi-national or even tri-national degrees .
As a consequence , the share of foreign students is large , making up 15.6 percent .
Nonetheless , the number of students native to Saarland is also above average at the state's university-level institutions , although many of those students do not have a diploma from a college-preparatory high school .
" In Saarland , many people make use of the vocational education system , " says Axel PlÃ 1/4 nnecke , education expert at the IW .
More than every fifth adolescent acquires their higher-education entrance qualification at a vocational school , which places Saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points .
Opportunities to combine vocational and academic education are developed comparatively strongly .
Relative to population , the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in Germany .
Despite a practice-oriented education and increasing demand , the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years .
Consequently , Saarlandâ $  s Department of Education is committing university-level institutions to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences .
" After the first PISA survey , we initiated a number of reforms at general-education schools , " a spokeswoman for the Department of Education says .
For instance , the government introduced statewide comparative tests .
In order for children to commence studying earlier , the final year at day-care centres is free of charge â $ " a model which other German federal states have begun to adopt .
Whether the studentsâ $  performance has improved substantially , future comparative surveys will show .
The 2003 PISA survey showed the share of at-risk students shrinking from 29 to 20 percent .
Overall , Saarland did not improve as much as other German federal states , however .
Bavarins are better at mathematics .
And , much to the chagrin of Saarlanders , PISA does not evaluate foreign language skills â $ " an area in which they might score .
After all , studying the neighbours ' language is mandatory at college-preparatory high schools - even though Saarlanders are not Frenchmen .
ChÃ ¡ vez Turns Back Clocks
In Venezuela , times are about to change .
President Hugo ChÃ ¡ vez has decreed that time-pieces in the South American country be turned back by half an hour on December 9 .
In Spain , meanwhile , ChÃ ¡ vez is becoming a figure of ridicule .
According to the Official Gazette of Venezuela , a new law decrees that clocks be set to GMT minus four and a half hours .
Thereby , the South American state creates its own time zone that does not apply to any other country in the world .
ChÃ ¡ vez , whose disposition towards the US has been hostile , cited a number of reasons for his decision . Notably , he alleged that the worldâ $  s division into time zones according to full clock hours was an imposition by the United States .
On Wednesday ( local time ) , ChÃ ¡ vez also announced a severance of diplomatic ties with neighbouring country Colombia due to a hostage crisis .
As long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia , the left-wing nationalist said , he would not entertain relations with Colombiaâ $  s head of state , nor with its government .
" My dignity does not permit it , " said ChÃ ¡ vez . He is pushing for a constitutional reform on which citizens of the petroleum-exporting country get to vote in a referendum on Sunday .
The reform would provide a significant extension of his domestic power .
The dispute was caused by Uribeâ $  s decision to revoke ChÃ ¡ vezâ $  s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia .
Uribeâ $  s decision was a " slap in the face " for Venezuela , ChÃ ¡ vez had complained on Sunday .
ChÃ ¡ vez is the talk of the town in Spain , as well .
A new ringtone for cell phones is causing a frenzy in the country : " Por quÃ © no te callas " ( Why donâ $  t you shut your mouth ) , says the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet .
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain . Annoyed by the left-wing populistâ $  s incessant interjections , Juan Carlos had rebuked him at the most recent Ibero-American Summit .
German Wages Feared to Drop in 2007
Despite a strong economy , wage earners in Germany have to fear a drop in actual wages in 2007 , projections say .
Experts cited a number of reasons for their pessimistic projections .
According to calculations by the Hans BÃ ¶ ckler Foundation , employees could face drops in actual wages in 2007 , relative to the previous year .
" The causes are a modest wage growth , the value-added tax increase and price advances for food and energy , " Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the daily newspaper " Bild . "
Additionally , new burdens could emerge for wage-earners in the unemployment insurance contribution .
Lowering the unemployment insurance contribution , as planned , to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was appropriate and reasonable in the present situation , Secretary of the Treasury Peer SteinbrÃ 1/4 ck told the daily newspaper " Neue OsnabrÃ 1/4 cker Zeitung . "
However , the Social Democrat reportedly also said that the Federal Employment Office should not have to ask for federal loans or grants again .
On Tuesday , it was revealed that exploding prices for food and petroleum products were resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years .
Overall , there was a year-on-year price increase of 3.0 percent .
Venus Is Earthâ $  s Hellish Twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere , Venus is more similar to Earth than anticipated : European space probe " Venus Express " discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles , similar to those occurring on Earth in winter .
For almost three decades , scientists suspected the existence of lightning on Venus .
Now , the European probe " Venus Express " brings confirmation â $ " it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere : On Venus , lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometres , reports Christopher Russel of the University of California , Los Angeles , in the science magazine " Nature . "
According to the famous " primordial soup theory , " life on Earth was conditioned by lightning : Supposedly , thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so on Venus : " If life ever existed there , it had to have been in the planetâ $  s very early history , " explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution , Washington .
Today , chances of life existing on the surface of Venus are slim : The atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth , with temperatures of up to 500 degrees .
" Venus may be a devilish twin of Earth , but a twin it is , " Russel said .
The key question of the ESA mission is why Venus , which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size , has undergone such a fundamentally different evolution .
The launch of " Venus Express " in November 2005 marked a milestone for Venus research . There had been no probe specifically designed to explore the planet since the early nineties .
The latest research results are now being presented in several " Nature " articles . According to the scientists , they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system .
" They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially anticipated , " ESA reports .
In addition to the known whirlwind at the North Pole , for instance , the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the South Pole , spinning at a significantly higher velocity .
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earthâ $  s winter hemisphere , writes a research team of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The mass of the solar systemâ $  s second-innermost planet is almost the same as that of Earth , as is its size , with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres .
The planet , which is also known as morning star or evening star , orbits the sun in just under 225 days .
Its rotation is much slower , however : One Venus day equals 243 Earth days .
With surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar , Venus barely resembles Earth . Nonetheless , scientists suspect that both planets developed under very similar conditions .
Water accumulated on both planets . On Earth it remained in oceans , whereas on Venus it escaped into space .
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is focused in carbonate rock , on Venus it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere .
KÃ ¶ hler Defends Merkelâ $  s Meeting with Dalai Lama
German Federal President KÃ ¶ hler is demanding an end to the party dispute on the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception at the Federal Chancellery .
He indirectly criticized the Social Democratic Party because of its attacks on the chancellor after Septemberâ $  s meeting .
Worried about Germanyâ $  s reputation , German Federal President Horst KÃ ¶ hler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception .
" We should not face the world as a nation that is divided on this issue , " KÃ ¶ hler told the trade journal " Handelsblatt . "
At the same time , KÃ ¶ hler signalled his appreciation of the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel , a Christian Democrat , in September .
" I consider human rights to be universal , even though I respect the diversity of cultures , " KÃ ¶ hler said .
The President stressed that everyone was aware of Germanyâ $  s obligation to maintain delicate balances in foreign affairs . However , he defended Merkel against charges of pursuing a new policy with reference to China .
" The Chancellor has not departed from our traditional policy towards China .
China is aware of this , too , " KÃ ¶ hler said .
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier , a Social Democrat , had indirectly expressed displeasure at the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception , leading to attacks from the ranks of the Christian Democratic Union .
Among other things , Steinmeier had criticized what he called the Unionâ $  s " showcase " mentality in foreign affairs .
In the wake of the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception at the Federal Chancellery , there had been severe discordances in German-Chinese relations .
For instance , the Chinese government not only cancelled the inviation to German Secretary of the Treasury Peer SteinbrÃ 1/4 ck , a Social Democrat ; according to news magazine " Der Spiegel , " it also suspended the so-called strategically dialogue between the two countriesâ $  State Departments .
Chinaâ $  s head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to concede that the Dalai Lamaâ $  s formal reception was a mistake .
Stating Chinaâ $  s disapproval of European officials receiving the spiritual leader of the Tibetans , Wen Jiabao underlined the Chinese position .
The Dalai Lamaâ $  s actions and words showed his intention to separate Tibet and the broader Tibetan region , which also includes other present-day provinces , from China , Wen Jiabao said .
SchÃ $ uble Warns of " French " Riots in Germany
Clashes with the police , shots fired , burning cars : Wolfgang SchÃ $ uble warns of riots similar to those in France .
Any steps necessary to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating in public displays of violence needed to be taken , the German Federal Secretary of the Interior demanded .
Barricades were set aflame and rioters fired shotguns at the police : In the wake of the massive youth riots in France , German Federal Secretary of the Interior Wolfgang SchÃ $ uble , of the Christian Democratic Union , fears similar developments in Germany .
" We have to prevent the rise of social tensions which may escalate in violence .
We need to take this seriously , " he told the Hannover-based daily newspaper " Neue Presse . "
Some young adults were finding it difficult to adjust to a social reality that is changing ever more quickly , he said .
Federal , state and local governments were already hard at work on the issues , said SchÃ $ uble .
These were not limited to the integration of migrants , he added .
" Between the German Summit for Integration and the Conference on German-Islamic Affairs , we are beginning to see results . "
But it was too early to sound the all-clear , he said .
At the same time , SchÃ $ uble pointed out that German suburbs were not suffering from the same urban-construction and sociological issues as their French counterparts .
In suburbs north of Paris , there had been violent clashes between youths and the police in recent nights .
Cars and public buildings were set on fire in Toulouse , as well .
Kenan Kolat , Chairman of the Community of Turks in Germany , is asking the German Federal Government to step up its integration efforts , meanwhile .
In light of the riots in France , Kolat warned of " copycat effects . "
The situation in Germany was not as urgent as in France , he said .
But there was still a need for action .
The unemployment rate among youths with a migrational background below the age of 25 was " above average , " Kolat noted .
Above all , more vocational training positions needed to be provided .
" We need to provide options to these youths , " Kolat emphasized .
However , the Chairman of the Community of Turks added that " a social supervision in families " applied in Germany more than it did in France .
In addition , many youths did not want to destroy what their parents had built for themselves in Germany , he said .
" We still need to be careful , " Kolat urged .
Youths needed to be " given the opportunity to participate in labour and education . "
In the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel , the night remained quiet , meanwhile .
Hundreds of policemen were on alert , and a helicopter circled the area with searchlights .
The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a number of burning garbage cans and cars .
Since the day before , a security force of 1000 has been keeping the peace .
After visiting the suburb , Secretary of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as necessary .
During the night of Monday , about 80 policemen were harmed in riots .
In the following night , the unrest encroached upon Toulouse .
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident which had caused the deaths of two youths on Sunday .
According to an initial investigation by the Office of the District Attorney , the police were not to blame in the two youthsâ $  deaths .
In the Realm of Angela in the Sky
Divorced from reality , the Chancellorâ $  s performance documents that the coalition is at the end of its rope conceptually â $ " and that expectations in herself have to be scaled down to nil .
What country , exactly , does the Federal Chancellor live in ?
After her desolate performance at the Bundestagâ $  s general debate , which was cloddy and bereft of substance , the verdict is : not this one â $ " not in the country she ought to be governing .
The charge that she concentrated too much on foreign affairs , she dismissed with a terribly presumptuous statement .
It was provincial , she said , thereby demonstrating her refusal to grasp the criticsâ $  meaning .
At the Bundestag , she documented , in plain sight of everyone , how right on target their criticisms are .
Neither a tangible concern for , nor any sense of the countryâ $  s issues could be detected .
Instead , she presented herself as Angela in the Sky : a detached politician who takes refuge in foreign affairs , but remains noncommittal even there .
Take , for instance , climate protection : She excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of Heiligendamm , but does not share how climate protection objectives are to be achieved in this country .
And anyway , the self-praise â $ " two years ago , the leader of the Christian Democratic Union would have denied herself this much immodesty .
Now she is clinging to the slogan that the economic boom has arrived at peopleâ $  s doorsteps .
In doing so , she damages her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems , instead of sugar-coating the truth .
But in the realm of Angela in the Sky , domestic issues are of marginal importance .
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage earners ?
A few asides are all she has time for on that .
It is telling how often she misspeaks when it comes to childrenâ $  s allowance .
At this point in her address , Merkel needs three attempts to produce a reasonably serviceable sentence .
As soon as things become concrete , she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground .
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates , favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough exchange of blows â $ " and now have to fear an underdog candidate .
The candidatesâ $  tension is finding release as early as at the first subject .
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a " safe haven for illegal immigrants . "
The latter counters with bold allegations of his own : " I would say his own home was a safe haven for illegals , " Giuliani retorts , charging the former Governor of Massachusetts with having privately employed immigrants without paperwork .
The candidates mount the attack : Because the Republican base still lacks a clear favourite , the eight presidential contenders use the CNN debate , first and foremost , to discredit their opponents .
The self-made 30-second videos submitted via YouTube by internet users contribute little more than cues .
" This is the kind of isolationism which allowed Hitler to rise to power , " John McCain accuses opponent Ron Paul , the only one in the group demanding an instant withdrawal from Iraq .
Romney , too , is sharply reprimanded by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to denounce the so-called " waterboarding , " an interrogation technique which simulates drowning , as torture .
However , audience reactions in St. Petersburg , Florida , show that the important issues of the campaign are far off from the Iraq War and the torture debates .
Whenever conservative values are praised and the notion of future tax increases is rejected , there is applause from the auditorium .
In the process , the two favouritesâ $  weak spots once more become apparent .
" I was wrong back then , " a remorseful Romney announces , apologizing to base and audience for having endorsed abortion as recently as in 1994 .
Giuliani faltered when asked about his opinion on taking the Bible literally , meanwhile .
Musharraf Begins First Civilian Reign
One day after resigning as army chief , Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president .
Thus , eight years of military rule in Pakistan came to an end .
On Thursday , President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term in office .
The ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad was broadcast live on Pakistani television .
Musharraf vowed to honour the constitution and to act towards the good of the nation .
On Wednesday , he had consigned the office of army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani , yielding to international pressure , by the US in particular .
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup , the former general now for the first time reigns as a civilian head of state .
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces , Musharraf had complied with one of the key demands of the opposition and of the West .
Ending the state of emergency , which Musharraf had declared on November 3 , is another central demand .
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum , Musharraf will revoke the state of emergency soon after being sworn in , and by doing so meet another of the demands of the West .
Last week , the countryâ $  s supreme court had overruled all objections to the head of stateâ $  s controversial re-election on October 6 . After declaring a state of emergency , Musharraf had filled it with jurisprudents who were well-disposed towards him .
In the northern Tribal Area of North Waziristan , four soldiers were killed and four more harmed in an attack on a military convoy , meanwhile .
According to an army spokesman , the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border .
The Fathers of Krautrock Are Back
Germanyâ $  s super group of the seventies is reunited : At a concert in Berlin , the three band members of Harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles .
To celebrate the reunion , " Live 1974 , " a recording from their heyday , is released .
Even back then , they were much more famous abroad than in Germany .
The arranged sensation , then , occurs in the shape of three composed gentlemen at the dinner table .
Each of them has his little box in front of them , his wires and , most significantly , his keys .
Dieter Moebius , 63 , wearing a pristine white shirt , is throning at the centre .
At his left flank is Michael Rother , a paltry 57 , wielding a laptop computer and a guitar .
And at the right , from the auditoriumâ $  s point of view , Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 , is bent over a mixing console in concentration .
Each of them is contributing noises , sometimes even a beat .
And once in a while , it inadvertently fuses into a conventional piece of music .
The gentlemen themselves do not seem overly bothered when it does , either .
The band Harmoniaâ $  s reunion has caused some excitement among Krautrock aficionados .
Although , it may be disclosed here : Specific inquiries uncovered that while the name was buzzing through collective pop memory , it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years .
But why should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies , too ?
Especially given that what is misleadingly called Krautrock had always been held in more esteem in England or America than at home .
When the music industry gave an Echo Honorary Award to the survivors of Cologne group Can in 2003 , quite a few quizzical German pop faces were to be seen in the room .
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers proceeded to thank the bands La DÃ 1/4 sseldorf and Neu ! in their panegyric , the bewilderment knew no bounds .
At shows later on , Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers , like an old pal .
The problem with the ignorance at home and a misty-eyed view abroad is one thing .
Harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only , making much less of an impression in that period than others would attest in hindsight .
Moebius and Roedelius had earlier collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler , under the promising name Cluster .
Initially , they played in the basement of the SchaubÃ 1/4 hne in Berlin .
After that , for economical reasons , for a record label owned by the church , in DÃ 1/4 sseldorf .
Rother had briefly helped out Kraftwerk , and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu ! , at the time perhaps the most radical German group .
Around 1973 , however , Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile , to Forst , in the Weser Highland .
There , at the Alte Weserhof , an old ruin dating to the 16th century , they lived as communards , away from the cities .
Less ideologically than at Kommune I , where Roedelius had once laboured as a nanny .
But rather living the Spitzwegian life of an artist .
Allegedly , a banneret of the Glee Club Harmonia Ottenstein was found amid some scrap , and thus , a name for their art .
Quite a bit of that was documented by Harmonia .
The first album was called " Musik von Harmonia , " the next one " De Luxe . "
Because , as relaxed and modest as the music may have sounded , the band was in great need , materially .
The brushwood collecting was not just for self-discovery purposes .
The newly released CD " Live 1974 " was recorded at a concert in Griessem , in front of a record audience of 50 , as somebody seems to recall .
It was Rother , back then , who wanted to push Harmonia and practice occasionally .
For Roedelius and Moebius , it was an unethical proposition .
The band declared its split in 1975 .
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical field and earned his livelihood with albums such as " Flammende Herzen . "
Cluster became fashionable again in the eighties , and went on to be more successful than Harmonia ever was .
The Griessem live album is owed to Herbert GrÃ ¶ nemeyer .
His record label GrÃ ¶ nland aims to preserve Krautrock as Germanyâ $  s own distinct contribution to lively music .
Neu ! has already been exhumed in the process , as has Roedeliusâ $  solo work .
The in-the-flesh resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of Cultures of the World .
Publicly funded , as part of the Worldtronics Festival .
Julian Cope is there , Brit , former punk and author of the handbook " Krautrock Sampler . "
So is Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte .
Which offers a sketch of the whole range of influence Krautrock had on subsequent pop music .
Harmoniaâ $  s part is to fill the gap of the supergroup .
Along with the idiosyncratic sound , Brian Enoâ $  s dictum is hovering in the room : " The only true music , the future belongs to it . "
Images of the producer , in a farmhouse room with Harmonia , appear .
Projections of further black-and-white photos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend .
In front of it all , the three veterans are once again improvising .
No longer by sticking microphones to organ and drums in order to get the instruments to produce unheard sounds via the self-made effects devices .
Today , electronic music looks like electronic music .
Three tinkerers preoccupied with technical aspects .
Even the resident choir doesnâ $  t change that .
Directed by Barbara Morgenstern , there is coughing and whispering beneath clouds of sound , and , at one beautiful point , " Aaaaaaaah ! " is sung , with emphasis .
Krautrock , after all , has always been a very English term .
It never was rock .
The roots were to be found less in blues than at conservatories ( Can ) , in technologies ( Kraftwerk ) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions ( Cluster ) .
Those now exclaiming " â $  68 ! " are not entirely wrong , but , even now , Harmonia still donâ $  t lose their cool over it .
On the stage , even the most self-evident things are considered most thoroughly .
Where does music start , and when does it end ?
It can wreck your nerves , or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness .
Richard Gere Just Isnâ $  t Cynical Enough
" The Hunting Party " and " MÃ ¶ rderischer Frieden " make two more films dealing with the Balkan War .
But neither of them is convincing .
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action sequences and gunfire , or they are too maudlin .
Even Richard Gere , in " The Hunting Party , " canâ $  t change that .
The good news first : War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains . But right there , of all places , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war , the actor Richard Gere has now been recovered .
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately , after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel-good films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him .
Now , suddenly , Richard Gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch " The Hunting Party , " after all . ( The full German title is " The Hunting Party â $ " Wenn der JÃ $ ger zum Gejagten wird " - why do film titles always have to be as long and dizzying over here as labour agreements for engine drivers ? )
His performance is delightfully tongue-in-cheek . Essentially , his war reporter Simon Hunt is who Gere could have ended up as , had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him : A man whose heyday is long past , but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument .
Still , despite this trump card , " The Hunting Party , " along with the German production " MÃ ¶ rderischer Frieden , " which also debuts this week , merely continues the endless line of failed Balkan War movies .
" MÃ ¶ rderischer Frieden " can be dealt with fairly quickly : The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovan snipers - and one of whom promptly falls in love with her , to boot .
Although the fact that the Serbs , for once , arenâ $  t portrayed as the sole root of all evil here is to be appreciated , the film , in its TV-like shallowness , quickly gets lost in gunfire and action sequences .
What remains is something like the German car-chase TV show " Alarm fÃ 1/4 r Cobra 11 , " only with war taking the place of the autobahn .
" The Hunting Party , " meanwhile , is kind of like exhibit A in the investigation on why thereâ $  s actually never been a really good Balkan War movie .
With another director and another screenwriter ( Richard Shepard is both ) , and at another time , the story of three US war reporters committed to track down Serbian war criminal supreme " The Fox " might have ended up becoming a new " Apocalypse Now . "
The stories , after all , are strikingly similar : In both , small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military couldnâ $  t , and in both , the result is a journey into madness .
One of the reasons why " The Hunting Party " fails is that Simon Hunt isnâ $  t allowed to simply be the run-down cynic with a heart of gold weâ $  re introduced to at the beginning .
No , the script also has to saddle him with a romantic relationship on top of that , with a Bosnian muslim woman who is killed later on .
" The Hunting Party " goes off the rails altogether when the reporters , in fast-forward motion , achieve in the last five minutes what NATO , CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world havenâ $  t been able to achieve in five years : To catch the war criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian muslims .
This is so bad , it makes you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic .
The filmâ $  s concern , however , is actually a deeply human one .
It wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free as they please , and it suspects the Americans and the French ( apparently they agree here , for once ) of not being overly concerned with their pursuit due to secret political horse-trading .
But good intentions and evil are so similar sometimes that a popular poem by Brecht comes to mind .
In it , the wooden mask of an Asian demon resting on the poetâ $  s working desk is described : " With sympathy I regard the swollen veins on the forehead , suggesting : how hard it is , to be evil . "
Films like " The Hunting Party " have those very same swollen heads , in that case suggesting , however , how hard it is , to be good .
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie .
Recently , it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood Iraq movies have utterly bombed .
One could add : There has never been a good South Africa movie , either .
Rule of thumb : If some star actor is running around in the hot spots or on the minefields of the world , the result is something like " Rangoon , " with Patricia Arquette , " Beyond Borders , " with Angelina Jolie , or " Blood Diamond , " with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly , all of these conflicts are simply too recent .
After all , decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to direct a good Holocaust movie in " Schindlerâ $  s List . "
Some film or other may still mature â $ " the Vietnam works " The Deer Hunter , " " Apocalypse Now " or " Full Metal Jacket , " now considered to be classics , were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time , after all .
Or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays , with every instance of mass murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously .
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness required to tell good stories .
Part of the reason why " To Be or Not to Be " or " The Great Dictator " are such good films , after all , is that Lubitsch and Chaplin didnâ $  t yet know how bad the Nazi regimeâ $  s reign really was .
To be able to make good films , perhaps one must not want to be good .
Perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolkâ $  s is required .
Queried on the parallels between his historical novel " LempriÃ ¨ reâ $  s Dictionary " and the Balkan War , he replied : " Thatâ $  s just because some things never change .
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in gruesome ways , and there will always be war in Yugoslavia . "
Von Beust Criticized on Olympics Withdrawal
The mayorâ $  s withdrawal of Hamburgâ $  s application for the Summer Olympic Games has spawned sharp criticisms from representatives of politics and trade .
Many intend to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games .
Von Beust calls for a realistic assessment of the odds , however .
On Wednesday , Hans-JÃ ¶ rg Schmidt-Trenz , Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce , described the withdrawal as being " not good for the economic area . "
No other project had generated as significant a motivational force in the city recently as the notion of the Olympics , he said .
" Without that goal , the current sporting-politics momentum could not be maintained to this degree . "
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project , but to develop a new long-term approach that " follows a different timeline . "
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted on earlier statements on Wednesday , saying that Hamburgâ $  s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic , at least before the year 2028 .
" Itâ $  s the German Olympic Sports Confederation that has to decide on an application for the Olympics , not Hamburg , " Von Beust told " Welt Online . "
He was referring to the Confederationâ $  s decision on Munichâ $  s application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2018 , which is expected in early December .
" What this preference means for us is that we wonâ $  t have a realistic chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028 . "
However , this did not mean that the dream was over for good , Von Beust said .
The Sports Confederation Hamburg ( HSB ) regretted Von Beustâ $  s comments .
They created the impression that Hamburg did not intend to apply for Olympic Games for the next 25 years , it was said .
" Itâ $  s premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such an early stage , " HSB President GÃ 1/4 nter PloÃ  said on Wednesday .
Further , withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the head of senate on the occasion of a reception at a plenary meeting of the German University Sports Confederation , PloÃ  added .
There , Von Beust had insisted that Hamburgâ $  s application for the 2015 Universiade was " no substitute " for Olympic Games in Hamburg , he said .
The University Sports Confederation had nominated Hamburg as a candidate for application as recently as last week .
The Social Democratic Partyâ $  s fraction at the BÃ 1/4 rgerschaft , Hamburgâ $  s parliament , accused the senate of having wasted precious time by neglecting the construction of residences in Hamburg .
" The senate delayed the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years , because it had put all its eggs in the Olympics basket and neglected housing construction , " said Social Democratic delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast .
Whereas the Social Democrats had always demanded an integrated concept for the Olympics with a view to a subsequent residential use , the Christian Democrats had been slanted towards the " event factor , " they said .
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had generated much excitement in Hamburg at the time .
Hamburg was ultimately trumped by Leipzig , however .
Those Arenâ $  t Warholâ $  s Boxes
Connecting the terms " Sweden " and " wooden box " makes one think of Ikea , rather than Andy Warhol .
Or does it ?
Currently , wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are casting dark shadows on Warholâ $  s catalogue of work .
The bulk of the ninety-four Brillo Boxes " Type Stockholm " listed in it are forgeries .
After Swedish newspaper " Expressen " had cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warholâ $  s 1968 Brillo Boxes several months ago , an internal investigation at the Moderna Museet , Stockholm , now comes to a sobering conclusion : The six " Brillo Boxes " donated to the Moderna Museet by former museum director Pontus HultÃ © n in 1995 are forgeries â $ " as , presumably , are the bulk of the nearly hundred further extant Brillo Boxes of the " Type Stockholm " in circulation on the international art market .
The history is convoluted , a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions .
In 1964 , Andy Warhol created his first " Brillo Boxes " in New York : painted wooden boxes based on the red , white and blue design of the " Brillo " soap cardboard boxes .
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1969 presented â $ " with Warholâ $  s consent â $ " hundreds of Brillo Boxes made of cardboard : For economical reasons , those were not by Warhol , but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard mill .
They werenâ $  t works of art , but their models â $ " mere sample pieces .
Simultaneously , Warhol apparently consented to the production of a small number of wooden Brillo Boxes in Sweden in 1968 , which , however , were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet .
Contemporary witnesses now speak of approximately fifteen boxes which made art and auction history as original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation " Type Stockholm " back then , and rightly so .
Some of them went for more than 100,000 dollars at auctions .
The problem , now , is that legendary museum director Pontus HultÃ © n later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 , and subsequently consigned to him by Warhol .
As a matter of fact , however , HultÃ © nâ $  s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in MalmÃ ¶ , for an exhibition in St. Petersburg .
At that point in time , Warhol had already been dead for three years .
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes belonging to the Moderna Museet , Lars BystrÃ ¶ m , Chief Conservator at the museum , also examined three in private Swedish ownership , of which two had been manufactured in Stockholm in 1968 : Their pressboards were first primed and sandpapered , then white oil paint was applied with a brush .
The structure of the 1990 facsimiles reveals , however , that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming â $ " and , further , that it wasnâ $  t oil paint , but acrylic .
" These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warholâ $  s Brillo Boxes , " says Lars Nittwe , Director of the Moderna Museet . " Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York arrives at a different conclusion , the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as facsimiles/sample pieces . "
Of course , the Authentication Board had already announced an investigation into the " grave allegations " made in the case of the soapboxes back in July .
However , it has been shrouded in adamant silence ever since .
Renegade Soldiers Surrender in Manila
In the Phillipines , renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in Manila and demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo .
At the hotel , leader Anthonio Trillanes , who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud , told reporters that he did not want to cause bloodshed .
Earlier , government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas .
The approximately two dozen soldiers had occupied the hotel for hours .
On Thursday , around half of them had faced a court of law for a failed coup in 2003 , including Trillanes .
The latter then seized the trial to make a sudden escape along with 30 sympathizers .
The military police charged with guarding him had apparently defected and joined his mutiny .
They seized the Peninsula Hotel , demanding President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to be overthrown .
Troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area surrounding the posh hotel .
The president called for an emergency meeting of the National Security cabinet .
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiersâ $  actions .
" People have had it , " Trillanes said .
" We are calling on people to join us . "
Other military units were to join the march shortly , said General Danilo Lim , former leader of the Scout Rangers elite unit .
Regime critics had called for mass demonstrations against the president .
Her government has been facing allegations of corruptions for months .
Manilaâ $  s financial district had already been the focus of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo once before , by approximately 200 members of the military back in 2003 .
After nearly 24 hours , the insurgence failed when the armed forces refused to join it .
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Phillipines .
United Internet Major Shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company Versatel .
The average price per share was 14.46 euros , the company announced on Wednesday evening .
It was now holding 20.05 percent in share capital , it said .
The announcement followed speculation about a takeover .
Options to increase its holding of Versatel were being kept open , the company said .
According to United Internet , the move is intended to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market .
Earlier on Wednesday , there had already been speculation about an acquisition of shares after Berenberg Bank had increased its participation in the DÃ 1/4 sseldorf network operator by another five percent , to 15.1 percent .
The bank was merely holding the shares for a third party , rumours in the financial market suggested .
On the previous day , United Internet had already bought into mobile telecommunications operator Drillisch with around ten percent .
In the context of a capital increase , Drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares , with a total value of 106.4 million euros .
Of those , United Internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total .
Further , the companies are in talks over marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile telecommunications products .
" We are strengthening our partnership , " a spokesman for United Internet explained .
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP in order to buy competitor Freenet .
For the time being , the two companies will settle for a share of approximately ten percent and not make use of their option to buy another 18.49 percent of Freenet , United Internet announced on Thursday .
However , the two companies were keeping all their options open , especially with a view to increasing their share of Freenet AG , it was said .
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had been aborted in mid-November .
The months-long and at this stage fairly unclear power struggle over Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunication market .
At the close of the third quarter , Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed-line customers .
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has , so far , directly held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares .
Now , it had been arranged for Drillisch to acquire another four percent , it was said .
The option to buy 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas had already been arranged back in August .
