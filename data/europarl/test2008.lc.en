mr prodi has put an emphatic stop to this kind of action , which has hopefully resonated with mr moscovici , and i truly hope that this trend can be broken and reversed at the councils in nice and biarritz .
these are , as we know , very tricky negotiations and raise fears of a setback or a watered-down agreement in nice which , as you have already acknowledged , mr moscovici , would be even more serious .
any other procedure would mean a huge democratic deficit .
mr president , mr president of the commission , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank the european parliament delegation in the convention and the president of the convention , mr roman herzog , for their committed work .
mr president-in-office , i would ask you in all seriousness just to consider the following : if you now wish simply to go back to the cologne decision and reflect at your leisure on whether this should be incorporated into the treaties , what encouragement will those who disregard human rights draw from the fact that we are hesitating to do this ?
on this issue i would like to indicate , if not my disagreement , then at least some slight differences in opinion on two points .
he was quite right to emphasise the distance we have travelled since the fall of the wall and the reunification of germany ten years ago .
she also made an extremely worthwhile suggestion concerning the link between the charter and discussions over a future article 7 .
this is a feasible undertaking , and the university of florence ' s study would serve as an excellent basis from which to start work .
in saying this , mr moscovici , i have no intention of giving the community total control .
now , however , we are seeing that president putin is pursuing a policy of openness towards the west .
report ( a5-0235 / 2000 ) by mr skinner , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission communication `` risk capital : implementation of the action plan - proposals for moving forward '' [ com ( 1999 ) 493 - c5-0320 / 1999 - 1999/2208 ( cos ) ]
is this not a case of double standards ?
piecyk recommendation for second reading ( a5-0232 / 2000 )
at the same time , introducing larger buses would make it possible to reduce the number of buses on the road , thereby reducing damage to the environment .
to risk personal capital , in particular , is a highly precarious business .
in reality , they often have more in common with gamblers who hope to tap into goldmines .
it is quite specific , on the other hand , regarding the right to property and freedom to conduct a business , affecting primarily the capital-owning minority , the right to exercise this and to abuse it .
mr president , i abstained from the vote on the resolution on the charter of fundamental rights of the european union because i consider that this charter is still extremely unsatisfactory , despite some progress .
as a member of the european parliament delegation to this body , having worked , together with my fellow members , on the matter for eight months , i must say that the charter of fundamental rights could well , in fact , have represented an added value for europe but that , as things stand at present , we can derive no satisfaction from either its content or the working methods which governed its drafting .
the csu 's europe group supports the horizontal provision which makes it clear that no new powers are being established for the community or the union .
because we think that the process of european integration warrants a genuine democratic public debate , there can be no political construction of europe without social rights or democracy .
that concludes the vote .
( a5-0249 / 2000 ) by mr poos on cyprus ( com ( 1999 ) 502 - c5-0025 / 2000 - 1997/2171 ( cos ) ) ;
i am convinced that some countries will be in a position to prepare themselves adequately within that time .
the french presidency will immediately inform the committee which you chair , mr brok , of the result of these negotiations , come tuesday afternoon , according to the tradition that has developed between us .
we in fact expect , in absolute agreement with commissioner verheugen , to enter into negotiations on 42 new chapters , i.e. between 4 and 9 according to country , just like the portuguese presidency before us .
the date of 1 january 2003 , which is the only one on which the european union has agreed , is , however , both for the candidates and for ourselves , an extremely ambitious objective and this is the deadline to which the presidency will be working .
i am quite ready , of course , to follow the very important debate we are all involved in here today .
the present and largest enlargement round in the history of european unification is a morally-imperative , strategically-needed and politically-feasible move .
when we see that the countries in the enlargement process have already stabilised their democratic systems in a short space of time , then that is their achievement .
they are also intended to help the eu institutions monitor their success and to act as a basis on which negotiating strategies can be further developed .
in preparation for this , the commission is working on a new monitoring system which will allow us to assess the state of progress in negotiations and actual implementation in each country accurately at any given time .
mr president , minister , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are debating mr brok ' s report on the progress made on the european union ' s enlargement process , an annually recurring theme .
an essential part of the report is paragraph 25 and the amendment which my group tabled in relation to it .
mr president , mr brok 's report is an excellent description of the european parliament 's position .
the challenge of reunification , even more perhaps than that of enlargement is so great that it suffuses and surrounds every debate in this house : this is why there is such depth and intensity to all our debates , including this morning 's debate on our own need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge .
the critical thing is not to allow frustration to grow among the candidates - that they are always in the anteroom but never quite in the chamber .
our group believes that it is quite possible , if we are so determined , to include the first group of applicant countries already in the next european parliamentary elections , if there is determination on both sides to do so .
our disagreements with a portion of mr brok ' s report range from points of detail to others of greater importance .
on all these subjects , the brok report confines itself to discussing adaptation and reform .
unmistakably , the personal commitment of the rapporteurs of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy and the productive exchange of ideas in those circles , point in the same direction .
enlargement , as i have just said , is a historic process , a duty .
the european union ' s credibility is implicated in this .
let us create the conditions for success , for it is important that this enlargement is not a flash in the pan , not just a symbolic decision that will go on to create problems .
none of you should be surprised if the negotiators , prime ministers , speakers and members of your national parliaments complain that it is all taking too long - apart from the fact that it is a favourite pastime in europe - everything takes far too long with the commission , i know all about that !
if we do not set a date , we may cause disappointment ; if we set too early a date , a certain complacency may creep in ; in other words , we shall address the question of dates when the time is right , i.e. if we can say when a country is ready for accession and when it is not with a sufficient degree of certainty .
we have already done this to the widest extent .
before i was born , freedom and democracy had triumphed over oppression and the insanity of war , and a european union was being formed .
they possess a rich source of culture , diversity and potential which the united europe can not do without .
if it completes the negotiations effectively and purposefully , estonia has a good chance of becoming one of the union ' s new member states .
the critical comments and the proposals in my report for urgently needed progress in administrative and social reform are designed to bring latvia quickly and successfully into the european union .
it is our job to continue to support latvia with the integration of the russian population .
the fact that the lithuanian currency is still pegged to the dollar is also important here , because as the dollar rises , so too does the value of the litas against the euro .
that is the only way of giving kaliningrad a chance to improve its development potential .
many of us feel that it would have been a good idea to specify the dates for accession in order to encourage the countries and give them a sense of our continuing support .
one problem specific to the czech republic , especially on the german-czech border , is the problem of prostitution , especially child prostitution .
we are in the middle of the negotiating process .
the problems i mentioned are not insurmountable .
these policies must lead to the free and unforced assimilation of individuals belonging to the gypsy community .
the current resolution and report focus on certain of the more controversial issues , namely nuclear safety , border controls , the treatment of minorities and the question of corruption .
perhaps it is no coincidence that those same public polls show that the european union ambassador is the second most popular person in romania today .
mr president , commissioner , your rapporteur endorses the contents of the commission ' s report on slovenia and notes that the criticisms expressed in 1998 gave the slovenian authorities a salutary shock , prompting them to speed up adoption of the measures necessary for accession to take place .
perpetuation of the status quo following the turkish invasion of july-august 1974 is not acceptable to the european union .
it was only logical for the european council in helsinki in december last year to give the green light for the resumption of accession negotiations with malta when the accession negotiations were extended .
the tendency in the report on poland , encouraging its politicians to speed up the harmonisation of its legislation with the eu and implement the acquis , and the successful conclusion of the agreement on the liberalisation of polish agricultural trade a few days ago are positive signals here .
he has the express support of our committee there .
allow me to comment on a few focal points .
hence , if we are to be honest , we can not keep setting up new hurdles in these areas .
but one thing is certain : the remarkable efforts and absolute determination of the candidate countries to join the european union must be incentive enough for us to get ready and able to enlarge .
mr president , we might be inclined to think that when new countries join the eu , this automatically means that they will have to introduce more stringent rules to protect the environment and nature .
. mr president , when pandora opened her box all the ills of mankind were released .
that is why my report devotes a lot of its recommendations to the need to encourage the phare programme to do more in the health field and to bring the countries into partnership now in the health action programmes and other areas .
we must begin to discuss this integrated and polycentric european development .
we have just heard something about the `` carrot '' in the regional policy and promotion sector .
there is a series of further points which the regional committee has mentioned in its report .
if we are not to risk a repeat performance in the candidate countries , it is crucial that we be clear about the fact that enlargement should not be of benefit only to men but also be of benefit to women .
i have already warned colleagues in central europe about this ; when the tone sobers down , then this is only proof that we are moving from the honeymoon period into a life of domestic normality within europe .
as a result of the intergovernmental conference , the conditions needed in order for the european union to be able to enlarge will be in place .
the group of the greens/european free alliance is calling for negotiations with the first group of countries to be completed by the end of 2002 , so that the first accessions can take place before the next european elections in 2004 .
the various reports reflect this mainstream attitude .
now that you have just emerged from your former prison , do not rush to enter a new one .
i think specifically that in going too quickly to six then to fifteen we have displayed our inability to build a europe which respects the disparities between its initial members .
we shall obtain increased competition and a more rapid process of reform in western europe too .
however , at various different stages , always during or immediately following the second world war , measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the copenhagen criteria , given the prevailing spirit at the time , and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period , including the peace treaties , was founded on precisely those laws .
it is for these reasons and , more importantly , because of our own experience in greece , that our opposition to the enlargement of the european union is meant as an expression of brotherly solidarity to the workers and people in general in the candidate countries .
it is imperative that the accession negotiations between romania and the union detail exactly what the romanian government needs to do to improve the standard and quality of orphanages in that country .
in mr gawronski ' s report , the commission is urged , by the rapporteur among others , to examine measures for furthering development and for strengthening the synergy between poland , lithuania and the russian region of kaliningrad .
commissioner verheugen , as chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i took advantage of the opportunity to visit the countries that want to accede to the european union .
the poos report notes that the state operates smoothly , respect for human rights and freedoms form the cornerstone of the social and cultural tradition of the island and the country ' s social structures are , first and foremost , humane structures .
the audiovisual sector is very important .
mr president , today ' s debate concerns the major challenge at the turn of the millennium : to unite europe in order to create peace and security , together with social , economic and environmental development .
mr president , as a member of the lithuanian delegation i would like to support the remarks made by mrs hoff in her report .
blatant discrimination occurs in other countries such as poland and malta .
it is a process that is having very mixed success , but it still inspires great hope , because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the union in the future , and will therefore be called upon , in a special way , to establish ties with their homeland , where their forefathers come from .
put aside any thoughts of replacing the principle of ` each according to his/her merits ' with that of ` each according to his/her merits , but not until my elections are over ' .
its cooperation with the international community during the kosovo conflict , and its balanced role at that time , are of great importance for the whole region .
it follows from this though , that there must also be privatisation and restructuring of the economy .
the ignorant and the excluded can not make up the information society : they are a sure sign of its failure .
member states could do more in their twinning arrangements to assist the applicant countries in developing their administrative capacity .
if any area of europe is ready , they are , especially cyprus .
it has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically , but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in europe .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we can not afford to underestimate the importance and potential implications of this historic opportunity to unite our continent and live in peace .
and , in addition , we really must see to it at the same time that the proper administrative practices are in place .
as vice-president of our joint parliamentary committee with the czech republic , i can vouch for the fact that this is true of the czech republic , but i assume the same applies to a number of other states too .
the fact that there has been a reunited germany in the european union for ten years now , bears witness to the solidarity between us . other countries should now be given the chance to share in this , even though enlargement is not just about solidarity .
on the other hand , a slow pace is also an obvious problem , leaving the candidate countries frustrated .
after two horrific world wars and fifty years of communist oppression and dictatorship when - in the name of an oppressive class struggle - democracy , religious freedom , the environment and our christian and universal dignity as human beings were trampled on , it is now finally time to unite our continent and our part of the world .
it should be made clear to all countries that accession to the european union is not quite the same thing as accession to the economic and monetary union and to the euro zone , and that there are different deadlines .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in his policy statement yesterday , mr prodi , the president of the commission , said that whoever weakened any institution of the european union weakened the union as a whole .
mr president , this very day we are going to enthusiastically approve - and with great interest in my case - the reports on enlargement involving candidate countries such as the czech republic , which is the subject of mr jã 1/4 rgen schrã ¶ der ' s report .
in my opinion , and i say it in the presence of a former attorney-general of ireland , the commission has not yet shown sufficient resoluteness in pursuing this matter .
( a5-0257 / 2000 ) by mrs paulsen , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on a proposal for a european parliament and council directive on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition ( com ( 1999 ) 654 - c5-0344 / 1999 - 1999/0259 ( cod ) )
this is a crucial and important point in preventive work .
the people of europe can not , however , properly rely upon such control ' s really being carried out if there are major differences of approach between member states and regions .
as i personally am not prepared to sacrifice food safety on the altar of the agri-food lobbies , i have withdrawn my name from the report .
when setting maximum values , we must remember that nature has its own set of laws , that harvests vary from year to year and that farmers are ultimately harmed by environmental effects over which they have no control .
we dealt in exactly the same way with all other matters relating to the blending ban .
this directive is the first link in a long series of decisions to be taken on food safety .
zero risk is , of course , impossible , but an early warning system must nevertheless be put in place .
we do not oppose the paulsen report - we fully support it .
the commissioner will know that in my country the independent advisory committee on animal feedingstuffs was worried that such a ban may actually drive out blending-down procedures into the world outside the eu where they are less likely to be correctly monitored and controlled for any future entry into the union .
i am pleased that the group of the european people ' s party and european democrats have withdrawn the amendments concerning the problems associated with dilution .
in the domain of eu consumer policy , i believe ` from stable to table ' has few rival claimants to the title of expression of the year .
unfortunately , however , despite all our efforts , it will never be possible to completely eradicate criminal practices .
mr president , this directive forms part of the consistent set of measures which is planned actively to render all stages of the food chain safe .
if hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended .
secondly , the commission can not agree to amendment no 27 , in which parliament proposes to delete the possibility of defining acceptability criteria for feed materials which have undergone certain decontamination procedures .
amendments nos 39 and 40 , proposing to delete the possibility of establishing an action threshold are similarly unacceptable .
the commission can not accept amendments nos 5 and 22 on the rapid alert system as they are currently worded .
the next item is the debate on the report ( a5-0233 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 79/373/eec on the marketing of compound feedstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 744 - c5-0020 / 2000 - 2000/0015 ( cod ) ) .
commissioner byrne , we are highly satisfied .
this obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request , and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the member states .
the question of genetically modified cereals should be regulated elsewhere .
the standards are scarcely comparable , let alone transferable .
this is a simple thing , but for ten years , we have sat and twiddled our thumbs .
i take a more critical view , however , of the escape clause which would give the commission the scope to take measures of its own without consulting the member states .
a second , necessary step in this process is to have exact data at one ' s disposal .
in the council , a very substantial majority of member states is opposed to the introduction of an obligation to systematically indicate on labels the precise composition of the compound feedingstuffs intended for productive livestock .
madam president , unfortunately i have to inform you and the house of a new tragedy at sea .
( the president cut the speaker off )
the recital would therefore read as follows : `` recital c ) whereas insufficient attention continues to be paid to the situation of the roma , whereas discrimination against the roma must be tackled seriously by the hungarian government through the adoption of a set of positive measures that may lead to the free assimilation of the individuals belonging to this community , whereas it should be possible to find a solution given that a minorities office has been set up and medium-term legislation has been passed which will help them to become integrated into hungarian society , '' .
mr president , i should just like to clarify the point that there is no longer a recital a but , by agreement with mr martelli , a new paragraph 1 .
i voted against the brok report on the enlargement of the european union , because whilst it may be very clear-sighted in technical terms , it is nevertheless prompted by mistaken political ideas about the future of europe .
extending the european union , at least in the first stage , to more than 100 million new citizens , will provide new impetus for the development and integration of the european economy as a whole .
his report clearly sets out the issues and the objectives of enlargement in the field of regional policy and he does so in both political as well as financial terms .
each enlargement has required long-term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements , often lasting for several years .
we must respond in an appropriate way to this enlargement which will considerably increase the number of poorer regions , and think carefully together about the risk of accentuating imbalances in europe , in order to ensure that europe does not become one huge heterogeneous mass .
so where is the ` progress ' for the populations of these countries who have never been consulted ?
i even fear that this collection of country reports and comparative reports will prove counterproductive , particularly in the countries that have applied for membership of the european union , and more especially in the applicant countries of central and eastern europe .
when i look at what has been done so far to that end at the intergovernmental conference , i feel that we have little cause for pride and that we should put our own house in order before imposing prior conditions on the applicant countries , especially when we ourselves have been unable to satisfy these conditions .
this is why i and my fellow members of the european parliament from the front national would like to spare the nations of eastern europe the mistake of being ` disintegrated ' within the american-european union .
we must henceforth seek out new types of measures and new tools to benefit all the areas which are lacking in infrastructures and service networks such as , for example , the south of italy .
it is to be hoped that the governments of the applicant countries will continue strengthening their administrative capacity so that the eu ' s acquis communautaire can be implemented in these countries prior to accession .
and it is this feeling - or lack thereof - much more than meticulous analyses of the accounts , which should , when the time comes , govern our choices regarding enlargement as european integration ceases to have any meaning if it is no longer primarily political .
i would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of poland , some of which belong to a pensioners ' party which is similar to the pensioners ' party which i represent in the european union .
restructuring of the agricultural sector would appear to be necessary in a country where the rural population represents 38 % of the total population and accounts for 4.9 % of the gdp , and where agricultural employment is estimated at 27.4 % compared with 5 % within the european union .
mr president , i am delighted that the house has adopted mr schrã ¶ der ' s excellent report by a majority of more than 90 % and that , for the second year in succession , we have made an issue of the benes decrees , which infringe international law and human rights , as well as highlighting their inconsistency with community law and practice and with the copenhagen criteria .
as mr wiersma said in his report , i would stress the progress made in the slovakian republic in the area of the protection of minorities .
van orden report ( a5-0241 / 2000 )
. i welcome the winterbourne report on romania 's application for membership of the european union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws .
on the contrary , i am keen to see cyprus in , but i could not accept this unbalanced report , especially paragraph 4 , and the failure to insist on at least on the desirability of having a political settlement prior to accession .
as mr de soto noted , we do not expect progress to be easy , and the success of the un process is far from assured .
it is essential to initiate projects involving both communities and to encourage dialogue between both parts in a new spirit of trust .
from the economic point of view , the accession of cyprus should not pose major problems , since it is a country with a market economy and a high standard of living .
mr president , the wholesomeness of feed materials and feedingstuffs is , of course , very important to the pensioners ' party , and so i voted for the paulsen report .
we have the example of the thousands of litres of dioxin-contaminated milk which could be legally watered down with quantities of healthy milk .
we must continue to condemn human rights abuses in burma .
for those of us comfortable and secure enough to fashion our own working and social environment , we can only begin to imagine the appalling , and sometimes life-threatening , discrimination which people face daily .
imagine the world through the eyes of a child growing up in a world which discriminates against it because it is female , a member of an ethnic minority , disabled or a lesbian .
job applicants who come from socially disadvantaged families or urban backgrounds or who are disabled are often not accepted .
they see the danger of having to hire people who do not identify with their values and convictions .
she tried to get into a restaurant to have a meal and was refused entry on the grounds that her physical appearance would put other diners off .
we in the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs have always argued that this fragmented approach gives the wrong political signal , as if there might be some sort of hierarchy in discrimination .
the fight against discrimination is something which concerns us all .
this parliament will send a clear message in our vote to all our citizens that we intend to improve member states ' record in ensuring respect for equal treatment , irrespective of age , race , disability and sexual orientation .
if this is a sign of what is to come , i hope he does many more .
i would also like to congratulate mr mann on the results of his work on the present report .
the fact remains that the report tabled by our fellow member , mr cashman contains many good things , particularly the space accorded to ngos .
we were also right to decide against including sex discrimination in this directive because there is already a separate european directive on sex discrimination , which will , in fact , be revised further to the commission proposals and which is founded on a much stronger legal basis , about which parliament , in fact , may decide in codecision .
the community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented .
ladies and gentlemen , i would remind you that whenever prohibition has been applied in europe it has been necessary to take a step backwards .
the president of italy addressed this house today and i was interested when he said that it was not the aim of this union to negate national values .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this week is an important week as far as the debates in this house are concerned .
this means that , for the first time , a different line is being adopted : we are not doling out funding left , right and centre but evaluating the quality of the operations and insisting on high quality ; the operations themselves must then be monitored and their results published .
for that reason we shall be supporting amendment no 18 to the mann report which calls for member states to repeal all penal code provisions discriminating against homosexuals .
there are many examples of this in france .
and the national laws in our 15 countries also practice discrimination , including the socialist france of the socialist mr jospin .
mr president , the proposal for a council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation extends the ban on discrimination beyond reasons of race or ethnic origin to other reasons which are used as a motivation for discrimination and which are mentioned in article 13 .
mr president , commissioner , part of the debate proves that we , in fact , need a directive , because if people claim here that europe is meddling in a centralist manner in an area which should fall under the remit of the member states , knowing what has happened in many countries of europe - even yesterday on television , there was again a whole raft of reports of attacks on jewish synagogues , a report on the rape of a woman of foreign origin etc - they must have some nerve claiming that europe does not need a directive on anti-discrimination .
two more messages .
i therefore consider that it is necessary to commit the public and private sectors to this task and , to this end , i believe that the public sector must provide an example .
article 13 of the treaty of amsterdam threw up a challenge for the european union agenda , which gave the community specific powers to initiate a variety of actions to combat discrimination , so as to ensure the same level of protection for all disadvantaged groups .
we must support amendment no 37 by the committee on employment and social affairs , which also exempts any restrictions on the religion or faith of persons who come directly into contact with members of that faith in education , social welfare or health care , for example , teachers in denominational schools , doctors and nurses in hospitals and hospices , visitors to inmates in prison , counsellors and carers for children , old people , teenagers and married couples , where these socially desirable services are provided by religious bodies .
i congratulate the rapporteur on this and , in conclusion , i shall vote in favour of these reports , with the exception of the point i raised just now .
mr president , commissioner , what we are now in the process of doing is translating article 13 of the treaty into practical politics .
i would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and cooperation in getting a coordinated view in such a short time .
there are three categories of amendment .
the commission is ready to simplify the wording of article 5 for better understanding of this provision .
we all know that this is very important , but i must stress that in some member states the collection of this kind of data infringes constitutional provisions on the protection of privacy .
i had to reply to more than 50 different points and amendments and i am very optimistic that these amendments will be adopted during the french presidency .
you can not claim to respect democracy and human rights if you do not act to stop weapons of murder and repression falling into the wrong hands .
it is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers .
in this sense , the titley report is particularly efficient and highlights not only the merits but also the omissions , the innate limitations of the council 's report and of the feasibility of implementing the code of conduct .
we continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date , in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry .
mr president , its undeniable merits notwithstanding , the report is very technical and sticks to the paradigm and framework of military security , and it lends disproportionate weight to considerations relating to the defence industry .
on the basis of this consideration , i would argue in favour of clarity : which criterion prevails in the event of the criteria quoted by mr titley clashing ?
the code has already increased mutual understanding of member states ' policies , it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and it has encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions .
a number of projects are currently in progress or under consideration .
by means of its resolution of 18 may 2000 , this parliament lent its firm support to this project , which is now being put into action .
these proposals will become part of a series of specific communications , each of which represents a contribution to the establishment of a european research area .
it has an important role to play .
commissioner , i would like to draw your attention to a very long-standing issue for whoever has been involved in research .
there are new proposals to champion .
i would , however , like to say before parliament that it is important for this need , which has been expressed and which is , moreover , a force for economic development and innovation in this area , to be considered at the level of the meda programmes and at that of all the external relations programmes .
if i am unable to give you an immediate reply on this today , it is because it was precisely my intention , in this policy paper , to invite the member states to adopt a position , for there will never be a european research area if it stems solely from the will of the commission .
as regards the ecsc programme , you will be aware that an agreement has been reached , and that research will continue .
i have to report not only to the court of auditors and to the tax-payers , but also , first and foremost , to the european parliament , which is responsible for budgetary control and for adopting this budget , and i believe that it is my duty and role to say what is happening , at such times as i judge fit , and to do so in a transparent manner , with respect for the budgetary authority of which the european parliament forms part .
i think the ball is in your court : your staff have the details , but they must be allowed to provide an answer .
i believe that negotiations are in progress on 83 of the 102 spds to be signed , although i am only speaking from memory .
as the honourable member pointed out , the duty on fuel and diesel used as motor fuel which applies in the united kingdom is the highest in europe , but duties on fuel oil and kerosene , at least if - and insofar as - these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or even for heating , remain far below the highest values applicable within the union , as is also the case with the duty on heavy fuel oil .
therefore once again , the commission has no instruments to get member states to change the level of excise taxes .
the logic of economic reasoning supports the statement made by mr martin .
however , if he comes to me with a particular case in point , a particular region , or whatever if may be , then i would be happy to raise the matter with my colleague , mr barnier .
dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward , but we must be able to prepare these minorities .
for a wide range of sectors this means the reduction and phasing out of activities .
what would you think if , during its presidency , the swedish government demonstrated this power by taking action to reinstate economic support for ecpat sweden ?
to withdraw support for this work would therefore be to go both against the council ' s and parliament ' s demand for priority to be given to the fight against the child sex trade .
i would like to thank the commissioner , who spoke succinctly yet unequivocally on the issue .
the provisions are extremely comprehensive and touch upon various rules affecting hunting .
i should like a guarantee from the commission that under absolutely no circumstances will the rules in this document apply to meat consumed by people for their own household needs .
i will present a report on the implementation in the member states of the community legislation on the protection of animals during transport to the council and to the european parliament .
. as i indicated , the commission is currently working on a report on the operation of an animal transport directive in the member states .
the criteria are currently under discussion .
concerning these aspects , the commission has already prepared a mandate for the standardisation bodies to draft standards on the use of computers over long periods .
as the author is not present , question no 12 lapses .
it has to be said that if we avoided any political contact at all with governments or regimes whose human rights record we profoundly disapproved of , there would be a lot less foreign travel by governments and heads of government .
aung san suu kyi has long pressed for such a dialogue .
in those circumstances it may well be that a mission would be justifiable .
eu member states provide the bulk of the osce budget , and the european commission has also provided eur 5 million for equipment for the registration process .
i happened to be there together with 200 other election observers from 52 countries .
mr president , i congratulate mr titley on his report , as others have done earlier today .
mr president , the european defence industry is important , but at least as important is world peace .
if you look at the other countries in europe which are now getting involved in the arms industry it is extremely disturbing .
the arms trade is characterised by the fact that the major purchasers are poor countries , which seem to be able to find the money for arms but not for anything else .
in its first report the committee of independent experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate - even conflicting - activities , which do not belong in the same department .
secondly , the commission 's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions .
parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although i hope the full text will be forwarded to parliament soon i also understand the commission 's wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight .
also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently , admittedly in a decentralised manner , but certainly not under the director-general of the directorate-general under scrutiny .
today we still do not know whether it will and until we do i would advise this house to take a rather sceptical view of the european commission ' s reform process .
i think the committee on budgetary control held important discussions on this subject and the commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee ' s authority during the further reform process .
unlike the internal audit , the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made .
there has also been a certain carelessness , of which i am sure the commissioner will take note , so that we will , as soon as possible , achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van hulten report .
i want to thank both committees - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budgets - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs , mr van hulten and mr dell ' alba , who was unable to be here today .
i really find this proposal so useful that i am only sorry i did not think of it myself .
clearly , we can not attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minors in that , under the principle of subsidiarity , each member state is sovereign in this matter , but also because cultural and moral concepts and therefore views on these issues differ widely from country to country : for example , there are differences in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence , etc .
i believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones .
but we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems , that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility .
allow me finally to emphasise that the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party is also concerned about the increase in the number of tv programmes containing sex and violence .
so all those concerned , starting with the children , via the parents , the teachers , the countries , the european union and , beyond them , the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects .
there is no question of simplifying matters or engaging in generalisations , even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the european parliament , but there are a great many examples .
subsidiarity must serve some purpose , however , and not act as a screen .
the objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principles of self-regulation , and my officials have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the member states .
no-one has more respect than i for mrs reding and her commission staff so i am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular points that i raise and that she will not present a prepared statement .
this is why the category of researchers should be included , mr evans .
i believe that the european commission was wrong to exclude them .
i am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility .
despite several opinions from the courts , recommendations from commissioners and actions at council level , nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the italian education minister .
mrs reding , mr busquin and his directorate-general are not doing anything about the training of researchers , nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors ' training .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , may i first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those , in the relevant committee and in this chamber , who have committed themselves to making mobility a reality .
our heads of state and of government and the regional and national governments have realised that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social sides of the european union .
mr president , it is my great honour to welcome you to the european parliament .
we are once again deciding the fate of our continent , in a similar way to the great statesmen of the 1950s .
the concerns generated by the current value of the euro are well-founded , but it must be remembered that all major currencies have , at one time or another , been subject to massive swings in their daily quotation on the markets .
if i had known something useful for my family that was not so for my nation , i would have sought to forget it ; if i had known something useful for my country that would have been prejudicial for europe , or which would have been useful to europe but prejudicial for the human race , i would have rejected it as a crime . '
this emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women .
the second issue for this ministerial conference will cover combining work and family life .
first of all , the guidelines for employment , this time fleshed out with quantified targets , which propose to increase the employment rate for women to 60 % by 2010 .
civil society ' s expectations are high , and this has not escaped the members of the convention , who are anxious to have a gender-correct charter .
they have a much smaller share in the labour market than men , a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries , especially in southern europe .
i am a man in an eu within which men and women do not have equal opportunities .
perhaps this issue of gender needs to be pointed out in this assembly .
reference was also made here several times to mainstreaming , and i can only agree with what has been said here that , for example , in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective .
nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
it is really very annoying that these women , from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts , are rejecting the radiant future of the euro .
the present report , however , puts forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality .
human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to god , their creator , on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other .
that was three years ago .
the european parliament employs 30 % women , which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions .
in practically every sphere of activity , serious inequalities still exist .
thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality .
women are forced into temporary work , they are far more exposed to insecure jobs and unemployment , and on average they are paid 30 % less than men .
we therefore need to assess the real situation of women , we need to draw up indicators and we need to make our political action binding , so that progress really reaches everyone and not just a few .
obviously not , and as someone involved with associations for social change - because i too , like many of you , have some thirty years of involvement with these associations behind me - i know how hard the social movement , the feminist movement and the intellectual movement , naturally , have worked to move this issue forward , and today we take our places in roles of responsibility in our institutions .
i have not lost hope , however , of improving the text .
i fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report .
mr president , commissioner , this morning we will approve the council common position definitively adopting this reform of the community customs code .
finally , amendment no 11 requested that this modification to the community customs code enter into force before 1 january 2000 and is , therefore , no longer valid .
i think that , once again , the conciliation procedure , which means agreement between the institutions , is working properly .
after all , in the community customs code , a successful attempt has been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , which surely must always be the objective .
taking into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now finds itself , i am of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure , assuming that the debate were extended , would have been quite uncertain .
mr president , on that last vote , i would just like to inform the house that the commission issued a press release yesterday and commissioner reding spoke last night to the effect that , as regards the report we have just passed and agreed on mobility for teachers , students , academics , others involved in education , and helping them to move around europe to study , to work and everything else related to the education field , the commission will not accept the amendments which ask them to do something to enforce these arrangements .
mr president , this is on a mistake in translation too , though not as important as the one just mentioned .
we independents therefore support - above all , in the interests of enabling the internal market to function successfully - the demand of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , for the commission to draft a legislative proposal concerning the place in which the customs debt was incurred .
while this proposal is a step in the right direction it still contains a number of gaps which the evans report remedies .
- ( sv ) while in principle we adopt a positive view of the european parliament and the council ' s recommendation on mobility within the community , we would like to state the following :
the association agreements concluded between the european union and the candidate countries , and those which have yet to be concluded , should incorporate regulations banning discrimination against groups protected under article 13 .
thus , the usual principles of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination , with the european parliament and commission only too happy to join in and poke their noses into every national law .
i felt it was essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of article 13 of the treaty .
moreover the snp sees this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlying objectives of the european union in recognising that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assists the eu 's aims of permitting the free movement of its citizens .
the authorities already have their work cut out .
this is a very complex area and the proposals are far-reaching and ambitious .
they also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god , the only infallible rule of faith and practice , forcing such believers to employ those who propagate and practise acts of sex totally against the scriptural ethics .
this view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation .
even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the european production and export of arms politically , we are sceptical about the titley report , mainly for the following reasons .
support this report from my colleague , gary titley , and agree with him that responsible arms trade practices form part of the `` acquis communautaire '' and therefore candidate countries should be actively involved in the further development of the code of conduct on arms exports and that this should be legally binding .
the european states have sold arms to indonesia , whose army is implicated in the massacres in timor and the moluccas .
once again , the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children , i.e. the members of tomorrow ' s society , are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive .
minors are different from adults .
i will be working closely at national european level to ensure that eu governments implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanisms which i have addressed .
the 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women .
equal opportunities at work , equal social participation , equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policies offensive to human dignity as a whole , without equal social prospects , in a society of unemployment and underemployment , with no welfare state , a society in which human values are costed and commercialised .
b5-0784 / 2000 , by mr salafranca sã ¡ nchez-neyra , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the crisis in peru ;
the adverse effect that north american backing for him has had on those desires must be neutralised by another influence , a positive influence in favour of human rights and full democratic progress , coming from the european union .
the european union has got to do something and do it quickly .
the commission , in tandem with the member states , is currently examining how we can best help , in practical terms , in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections , and , if need be , as observers of the process .
as the resolution states , the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on afghanistan ' s large neighbour , pakistan , as a means of trying to influence the situation in afghanistan , i would also add the other large neighbour , the people ' s republic of china , with which pakistan has excellent relations and collaborates at military and nuclear level .
that is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups , which i have the honour of defending here .
it would do the eu ' s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the united nations , with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in afghanistan .
the urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives .
it remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of jihad conspirator , osama bin laden .
human rights
at the moment , for example , there is a colombian priest , oliveiro medina , who is in brazil .
in this context , i would emphasise that the commission supports president pastrana ' s efforts to secure peace and will do everything in its power to promote lasting peace in colombia .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the macedonian government , and unfortunately not by all the political forces of macedonia , on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities , in particular the albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue .
this outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill , which was adopted by the majority in parliament .
mr president , i would like to echo mr lagendijk ' s praise of mr van der stoel .
mr president , general de gaulle spoke of the `` paix des braves '' i.e. the peace of the brave , in the era of franco-german reconciliation , by which he meant that patriots on both sides had been able to achieve a lasting settlement .
the funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the phare administration committee .
what amazes me is that the government and the company both insist that the express samina complied with all the safety requirements .
mr papoutsis has already `` dismantled '' a very important directorate in his ministry , the directorate of merchant ship surveys .
i hope today , and in the coming days and weeks , we will hear from the commission on what action they propose to take against these member states that do not take maritime safety seriously .
equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which , by operating as a private , profit-making company , is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling .
the first greek king was a bavarian , and it also has its effect in the present day , in that a particularly large number of people from bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country .
the member of the commission responsible , vice-president de palacio , therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001 .
the next item is the statement by the high representative for the common foreign and security policy on the situation in the middle east and the elections in yugoslavia .
there is an agreement that has not even been initiated , and negotiations are currently continuing in egypt .
it will give the serbian people the chance to rejoin the european family of nations and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbours .
but nor was camp david a failure , because the gulf between the parties was clearly narrowed and some serious taboos were overcome .
like others , i also want to express my concern about what is happening and , at the same time , say that , whenever this area is talked about , the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of its not taking very much to provoke a reaction , almost no matter what is said .
the explosion had been brewing for months : it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements ; when you can not find work to support your children , which is the case of my friend talal who works as a builder in the settlements , maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family ; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around .
the latest reports i have received - and i regret i may have to leave parliament to go to paris immediately - are that the parliament building has been taken over by the demonstrators in belgrade and the television building is now in the hands of the opposition .
it is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the holy places .
it is not acceptable only to condemn israel if the palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations .
we can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people , not a dictator such as milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators .
our objective is still - and i admit it - for there to be a new yugoslavia , a yugoslavia with an independent state of kosovo and an independent state of montenegro ; it is not for there to be new divisions , renewed conflict , renewed clashes or renewed force , that is not our objective ; on the contrary , a new yugoslavia needs to emerge , a democratic yugoslavia , where people stay willingly , not under duress , not under brutality , but because they are convinced that a federation can emerge which has a democratic future , a democratic future under different leaders and from which milosevic can be removed - if possible - by bringing him before the court in the hague , because we want justice , but we want justice with peace .
do not say in general terms , `` serbia belongs in europe '' , which is , after all , something which you have only recently discovered .
will it be by largest common denominator , or on the basis of a large majority in the council , which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue ?
statement by the president on yugoslavia
thank you , mr rã 1/4 big .
before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision , i should like to express our support for it , since it endorses parliament ' s position on relations between the european union and croatia .
legislation is already in place to achieve these aims .
this is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt .
i am sure we are all agreed that croatia must be given political assistance , but political assistance also entails financial support , because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . this can only be achieved , of course , if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere .
a third of croatia was occupied , and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government .
up until 1918 , both regions were rebellious sections of hungary and boasted their own language , culture and identity , but were thwarted by the official state authority .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the last few interventions , yesterday ' s debate and the one we are having today , show that despite the necessary and widely approved increase in the guarantee payment , and the increase in the guarantee payment for the eib loan , as we see it , what is needed is an overall plan for this region , a contractual agreement that cuts across the political divide and incorporates aspects of economic policy , together with discussion and decision-making .
i am grateful , on behalf of the commission , to mr seppã $ nen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing community guarantee for european investment bank lending outside the union to cover interventions in croatia .
( the sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m. )
it is on behalf of the whole house that i express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these people .
indeed , mr rã 1/4 big , i shall do so .
you are aware of the situation in campo de gibraltar , where there is a damaged british nuclear submarine .
i hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousands of other people who are political prisoners in burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country .
they have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by chairman spinelli , for instance , or turning our treaties into a constitution .
is there a speaker to support this request ?
mr verheugen gave the impression that , according to the current state of play , the european union will have ten new members by 2005 and , what is more , and this is more disturbing still , he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the council of ministers , which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the nice summit .
thank you , mrs palacio .
in short , here we have all the ingredients for mr pacheco pereira ' s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and , therefore , the group of the party of european socialists agrees with mr maccormick ' s proposal that mr pacheco pereira ' s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended .
we would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the social affairs council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty .
the committee on women ' s rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection .
let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas , in a very succinct way , as befits my allotted speaking time .
moreover , the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject .
i also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine community strategy on the working environment , particularly concerning health and safety .
i think there are some problems left unsolved , but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments .
i want to emphasise that , in the eu countries , we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy , and the decisions of the lisbon summit acknowledge this .
the fundamental notion of the general interest ought , moreover , to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness .
the name figueiredo should be there instead of my own name .
in conclusion , the objective of giving new impetus to european social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one .
our fellow meps from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party and , in particular , from the british conservative party , have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme .
we also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from developing the social economy and the services sector .
all these coordinated social policy actions will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion .
the working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : the policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated , and also supported by legislative measures , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods .
we must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy .
thank you , commissioner , for your interesting speech .
the commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance .
at the same time , we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life , equal participation and representation , social rights , the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes .
this means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women ' s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide , and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively .
women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation , and i am not entirely sure that mrs eriksson ' s report makes any contribution towards this .
the women ' s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision .
we think that it is very useful to create a web site , not only due to the increasing use of computerised media , but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded .
i am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy .
it is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life , at the decision-making centres , in social policy , in civil society and in human rights , together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education .
mr president , i very much welcome the commission ' s report .
in the light of the latest development , i can appreciate why the commission has , with good reason , adopted a harder line on south korea .
that is important in terms of the need for transparency .
when a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy , account must be taken of the social , structural and industrial implications , and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology .
as is well known , the commission opposed this merger , which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to say a warm thank you for the reports we have heard about today , and which do not just record what happened in the past , but also pick out the central themes of the present debate , and even incorporate the commission ' s plans .
lastly , boosting the citizens ' autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , european competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions .
in his report , my colleague , mr evans , thanks you , mr monti , for having got to grips with the issue of state aid policy .
hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact , including the need for transparency , are particularly valuable .
my feeling is that , together , we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy .
in the year in question , there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions .
as far as korea is concerned , mr lamy , who will be coming here during the course of the week , will be better placed to update you on the latest developments .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , today , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , i am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the commission 's report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for member states ' balances of payments .
in view of the current level of economic , financial and monetary integration , the likelihood that these member states will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view , but the mechanism must , nevertheless , remain in force .
the directive under discussion today guarantees that traditional vine varieties , which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions , are to be maintained and protected .
this is something that they are achieving , unfortunately , with the assistance of the french presidency , in a way that is completely out of step with the way european consumers feel .
it is my opinion that the klass report should be adopted , particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the committee on agriculture and rural development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220 , in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of gmos .
there is a second problem area , mrs klass .
if we were to accept this amendment , we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade , which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market .
as a result , i consider that article 7 ( 4 ) of our rules of procedure has not been respected .
that was the legal error on your part , madam president .
i feel that we should also be able to make headway in the field of social affairs , on the proviso that we do not tamper with the principles that underpin the various national social security systems , which gives us some room for manoeuvre .
the preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on closer cooperation , on very concrete bases .
the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , has spoken of something that he has dubbed the ` biarritz spirit ' .
there is a need to reassure those who are worried that under no circumstances will the sovereignty of the member states in taxation matters be challenged , and to also tell those who have worries that the idea is not to merge social protection systems , especially from the bottom up , but simply to see to it that the common market and the single market run smoothly within an enlarged europe .
as far as we are concerned , the key criteria for judging the success of the intergovernmental conference are whether majority decision-making is to become the fundamental decision-making principle in future , and whether the european parliament is to be accorded the status of co-legislator in all such matters .
there is one basic issue , however , that i would like the president-in-office of the council to clarify .
in this respect , i would also ask that a clear announcement be made regarding the proposal we are making , as we believe it makes political sense .
this would require majority decisions in the council to become the rule , and likewise , codecision for parliament , in agricultural matters , for example .
i too hope that nice european council is a success and welcome the fact that the peoples of europe , and large numbers of associations , ngos and trade unions are investing time and effort in preparing for it .
the pattern is familiar from cooperation on issues of legal policy .
i do not , in this respect , share the feelings of the chairman of the group of the european people ' s party on the possibility of ` one commissioner per member state ' .
i would also like to return to the issue of the number of members of the european parliament .
given the circumstances , how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development ?
i therefore believe that with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow , we are giving a very clear mandate to our two representatives , mr brok and mr tsatsos , to enable them to present a proposal to this end at the nice summit .
that would seem to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and i hope that headway can be made on this matter between now and nice .
unfortunately , france acted more as a spokesperson for its own interests and for those of the large countries than for proposals which could bridge those contradictions , even if mr moscovici is now trying to convince us that the opposite is true .
i have to say that article 93 , in the form in which it has been drawn up by the presidency , does not enable us to address even a straightforward debate .
if the european treaty accepted at nice completely dilutes the influence and representation of smaller member states , it is going to be very difficult to sell it and secure approval for it in referendums in these three countries .
mr president , president-in-office of the council , commissioner , on the subject of the situation in the middle east , two months ago this house was unanimous in praising the commitment to peace shown by avraham burg , the speaker of the knesset , and ahmad qurie , the president of the palestinian legislative council .
enlargement has turned from a dream into a nightmare for some people , who fear that it might upset the balance of power .
what is really worrying , however , is that what might be called a form of blackmail is being perpetrated against those who , when it comes to reforms , do not wish to go further than they have been authorised to do by the member states .
mr president , in our plenary sitting in september we experienced and shared moments of optimism and hope with abraham burg , speaker of the knesset , and ahmed qurie , president of the palestinian legislative council .
i believe it is right that today , we once again have a joint resolution before us from all parties in which we recognise - with due consideration for maintaining an equilibrium - that both parties must restore the peace ; we as nations can not do that .
we are the opposition and i feel that we have the right to vote for resolutions in favour of the charter which differ from those tabled by the majority .
this procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective .
to do otherwise would lead us down a blind alley .
examples include the european company , the pan-european liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services , which is stumbling along , the opening-up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation .
all the same , we did make reference to the intelligent and open work that culminated in this charter , in which national parliaments representing national opinions participated .
finally , i would like to thank mrs randzio-plath for her intervention .
to the left of us , we have karl marx , the revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights , because , in his view , the human does not exist in the abstract , and humanity could not constitute anything at all .
thirty years ago , great countries in the south of europe lived under dictatorship , and eastern europe was subsisting under the yoke of the soviet union .
at all events , do not kill it off today .
anyone who has studied the issue is aware of the mystery of the translations : while the italian version adopts the principle that island status is one of the valid criteria for community intervention , the french and other translations express a different concept and the english translation is ambiguous and could be interpreted in either way .
i shall now return to each of these points , but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate .
i could confine myself to thanking mr duhamel , and to simply pointing out that his text contains a quite unwarranted attack on president prodi - his were , of course , humorous comments - or even observing that he has not said exactly how he wants this constitution to be arrived at .
next , there is - and once again it is inevitable , yet questionable - an element of randomness , which is understandable , in the decisions made by the european institute of florence .
i understand that our italian friends , for the most part , have found some discrepancies between the different language versions of article 158 ( 2 ) of the treaty , some shades of meaning and outright differences , which may give rise to differing interpretations .
i completely share parliament ' s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged , but i have noticed , mr gil-robles , a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible , as in point 11 of your resolution , and i would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect .
during the first phase , we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the treaties of the european union currently in force , in a clear and comprehensible manner .
the rapporteur is quite correct in firmly stressing the need for the commission ' s powers of initiative and the participation of parliament , at least on a consultation procedure basis , to be the norm whenever there is reinforced cooperation .
the work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement .
it has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes .
we should nevertheless first ask ourselves what exactly our citizens want for the europe of tomorrow .
what is so serious about mr tautology ' s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery .
unfortunately , our hopes were dashed because , in addition to all their other problems , islands are paying the price for the different translations of the point in question .
in order to achieve this objective we must ask the nice council to open up the important reformist approach that can bring together political consensus and public support .
i hope that the french presidency will find a more efficient and imaginative way of assuring the candidate countries and the public throughout europe that we are not only addressing important technical issues but above all the political necessity to provide our continent with stability through the certain and guaranteed enlargement of our european union .
the duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting . i would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our group .
mr president , the question tabled by mr napolitano on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , refers to a very real issue and i think commissioner barnier ' s response and that of the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , were very clear .
now what we need is for the summit in nice to demonstrate the political will to ensure that the nice treaty combines these proposals , and other proposals formulated on other occasions , into an integrated institutional framework which allows the european process to advance properly and the european union to welcome the new member states in a positive and sound manner .
report ( a5-0290 / 2000 ) by mr riis-jã ¸ rgensen , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission ' s xxixth report on competition policy - 1999 [ sec ( 2000 ) 720 - c5-0302 / 2000 - 2000/2153 ( cos ) ]
i have already notified the registry .
texts like these confirm the fact that the role allotted to the european institutions , including parliament , is to be of service to the narrow band of the well-to-do .
'' it is because parliamentary immunity is independent that our institution has the power to review requests for waiver , particularly with regard to ` fumus persecutionis ' i.e. the presumption that criminal proceedings have been brought with the intention of causing the member political damage .
vine material provides the basis for optimum grape and wine production in terms of quality , class and quantity .
as far as new scientific techniques such as in vitro propagation are concerned , reference should be made to the fact that meristem propagation is excluded from in vitro propagation of material because , as we all know from numerous years ' experience and experiments by institutes , mutations occur when these points of the plant are used .
these mergers may have brought profits to the shareholders in the companies involved , but they have also cost their workers , their families and society as a whole very dear .
mr fatuzzo , i am unable to answer that question , for this is an explanation of vote .
for the purposes of this grant aid , a small and medium-sized enterprise is a company that employs less then 250 people .
the principle of market rules as the sole form of social regulation tends to do away with man and his creativity as individuals in the economy and the productive process and , more importantly , is indifferent to man ' s prosperity and only interested in the welfare of enterprise .
attempts to erode measures to protect workers still further , the attack from all fronts on the rights which they have fought for , in conjunction with attempts to minimise the specific weight of the public sector and the balancing function which state aid can exercise , do nothing except increase grass-roots dissatisfaction and leave workers no choice but to fight and resist .
the report ( a5-0236 / 2000 ) by mr colom i naval , on behalf of the committee on budgets , on the interinstitutional agreement on financial statements .
therefore , in principle , we have raised the payments in headings 3 , 4 and 7 to a level that will ensure 25 % coverage of the commitments to be entered into in 2001 as regards individual budgetary lines .
if you now take a look at the lines covering labour market measures and local employment initiatives , you will see that a total of almost eur 150 million has been made available for job creation measures under heading 3 .
we can not go on like this , slugging it out with one another budget after budget ; always over the same issues , and always going through the same motions .
this parliament represents the people of europe .
the council would do well to ensure that that is how things remain in future , particularly in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
the committee of the regions is currently giving less cause for concern .
we believe that changes are called for here , and would urge the commission to look into this .
the commission has echoed this proposal , and we are now prepared to support it .
that is why , when the ministers for foreign affairs meet and take some commendable decision or other , such as helping kosovo or serbia , the least of their concerns is whether there is enough money to finance the decision and whether it has to be taken from elsewhere , such as aid to development in africa , the meda programme or the promotion of human rights in the former soviet union .
modesty has prevented you from ending the list of rapporteurs with your own name .
in growing by 3.5 % for the year 2001 , the draft community budget is being increased by a far greater margin than the member states are permitting themselves for their national budgets .
the council has not deemed it desirable to take up the programming proposed by the commission , either in the proposal for a framework regulation or in its preliminary draft budget for 2001 .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office of the council , budgetary policy always requires foresight , and today we are discussing budget 2001 , the budget for next year , and so together we must decide what demands there will be on european policy and the european budget next year , which we will need to fulfil , and what challenges we will face there .
i would like to take this opportunity to say a special word of thanks to parliament and to the rapporteurs , mrs haug , mr ferber , mrs rã 1/4 hle and mr colom i naval .
but i would also urge parliament to be prepared to negotiate in these matters .
as to the question as to whether it will be possible to reallocate funds from agricultural policy , we will see that you get the latest forecasts on agricultural expenditure in the near future .
looking at the evaluation reports , the commission has produced a lot of documentation concerning the preliminary draft budget , for example for 2001 , which included a working document presenting summaries of results of a number of mostly external evaluations .
i think that , were they to support this amendment , my fellow members would be setting in place a technically fair and politically timely act .
in particular , we will again recommend , at second reading , that 60 new posts be created at the european court of justice , and , in addition , that the necessary funding be made available in the budget .
i am therefore pleased , and would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the committee on budgets , and above all , the general rapporteur , for the fact that we have at last worked out a joint plan on how to rectify the difficulties attending this draft budget , with a view to accommodating parliament ' s clear priorities , and boosting employment and social cohesion , although , naturally the situation still leaves something to be desired from the point of view of the committee on employment and social affairs .
in that regard , i would draw the commission ' s and the house ' s attention to the following issues .
i have to add , however , that sugar policy , for example , is now again the topic of debate , also within the commission .
we have criticised the shortcomings and the marginal role of the commission in the policy of control and observation and we therefore believe that this policy must be supported with an increased budget .
support from ispa , which is designed for preparations for enlargement , should be used to part-finance the launching of projects , so that limited resources can be used effectively .
even in 1999 , as much as eur 3.2 million was refunded to the member states because those resources were not spent .
we also hope that this heading will be approved .
i should like to draw attention to the fact that the issue we are petitioned on is the question of fraud and mismanagement of money in the european union .
we must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective .
i personally did not put my signature to them because one or two of them still go a little too far .
we are looking to rebuild people ' s confidence in our institutions .
what we are not prepared to do though , is to simply dismiss out of hand , things we believe to be necessary , and which have been recognised as necessities following negotiations with yourself and the commission , when there are new items on the agenda .
but that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them .
administration in the eu has been inexcusably poor , since , for example , last spring around eur 3 billion of unused funds were returned to member states .
it is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the community severely to the test .
above all , we call upon the parliamentary majority to again think carefully about whether all the staff - i.e. all 400 posts - should really be placed in the reserve , or whether it would not in fact make sense to come to a different vote on this matter .
this has got to be the worst possible message to be sending out to our friends and neighbours around the mediterranean at the time of enlargement .
mr president , the eu ' s budget is the union ' s choice instrument to define political areas of interest as well as core areas .
there is therefore little prospect of us receiving additional revenue in the form of higher contribution payments from the member states .
rather than carrying out a technical analysis of the budget or an interpretation of the amounts provided for in the respective ` revenue ' and ` expenditure ' columns , parliament should concern itself with the quality of both expenditure that has been released and expenditure that has been proposed , which specifically requires an assessment of the criteria for the use of appropriations and also an assessment of their impact .
fourthly , with regard to the reform of the commission ' s procedures and staffing policy , we must distinguish between issues relating to new admissions and the desirable - as far as we are concerned - creation of a permanent and compulsory early retirement system .
in fact , we have problem in that we have given too much .
if that happens we have major problems and mr wurtz may be our best friend at the end of the day .
question no 1 by ( h-0709 / 00 ) :
question no 3 by ( h-0714 / 00 ) :
question no 5 by ( h-0776 / 00 ) :
you may rest assured , finally , that respect for human rights , and the promotion of human rights , are , in any case , a key component of the european union ' s cooperation with third countries .
in the port of buenaventura , 20 peasant-farmers were murdered .
mr de rossa has the floor on a point of order .
as far as possible , the debate should not be academic and theoretical .
subject : viability of tobin-type taxes at european level in view of the recent report issued by the french minister of finance indicating that tobin-type taxes would not be viable if introduced by a single member state , what steps does the french presidency propose with a view to securing the viability of such taxes at european union and global level ?
we are even aware , and this is an economic line of reasoning , that if there were a broad consensus , then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory .
let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax .
i should just like to repeat what i was saying , which is that the influence of a tax of this kind on the volatility of the exchange market has not actually been proven .
as regards the question you addressed to the council , i.e. the idea of study , please be assured that i shall convey your idea , most sympathetically , to the chairman of the ecofin council , who incidentally is also a government minister , and perhaps this will also answer mr harlem dã © sir ' s concerns .
question no 15 by ( h-0729 / 00 ) :
mr president , i thank the minister for his reply to the first part of my question , but his answer to the second part , which concerned compensation , was not entirely relevant .
i was at a foreign affairs meeting when this question came up .
this is what we wanted to do in this context .
in my opinion , the commission has put up a poor show and the council has compounded the situation by beating the commission down on its agricultural expenditure schedule right at the start of this year in the council meeting of july of this year .
i would nevertheless emphasise , in particular , that , six months ago , one of the political priorities was stressed in this chamber .
it will be not unknown to some members here that my party , the ukip , seeks the withdrawal of the uk from the european union .
in the medium term we will see the importance of the decisions that parliament is beginning to take today .
on the first point , i believe that this budget continues to apply the principles of budgetary rigour , budgetary prudence , improving efficiency , more effective budget control , better use of resources and a general tightening up , which are all vital to increase the confidence of the eu citizen in the institutions .
there needs to be greater vigour and determination for the parliament , council and commission to cooperate as closely as possible on issues such as translation , interpretation , libraries and buildings .
there are major organisational changes under way , and there is a need for a new culture involving both a genuine desire to accept responsibility for implementing the individual parts of the budget and acceptance of the fact that there are consequences if the responsibility is not fulfilled .
the commission is now quoting a figure of 1.07 , and the council wants a figure of 1.05 . 1.27 is really the agenda figure .
in berlin last year it was agreed that the budgetary provision for agriculture for the period 2000-2006 will be over â # 506 billion , that the 15 member states of the european union will continue to contribute 1.3 % of gross national product to the overall annual budget - which of course includes measures to finance the proposed enlargement of the european union , a proposal which i and my other colleagues fully support .
ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , that was a political act which was not particularly received well by the albanian kosovars .
the european parliament has just one way of showing that it has self-respect and respect for the people in the member states and that is to accept the amendment tabled by our group and reject the entire budget .
those responsible for politics and the economy in serbia emphasise again and again that they do not wish to become dependent upon our help , but that they need our help now in order to alleviate need in the short term and that they will then need help to help themselves introduce a social market economy in the medium and long term and in order also to make necessary foreign investment possible .
the mainstay of parliament ' s strategy should be to force the council to guarantee that new resources will be allocated to new objectives , in order to prevent these new objectives from being implemented using resources earmarked for existing priorities .
mr president , it is a promising development that , this year , we are close to sharing the council ' s views where most of the important points are concerned and that we can show budgetary discipline but still uphold most of parliament ' s priorities .
it is perhaps a kind of transitional year , a year wedged between last year ' s nerve-racking events and those which may lie ahead next year .
at the council meeting ( budget ) , which takes place at the end of november , initiatives ought , in my opinion , to be taken to produce a significantly lower rate of increase for category 1 .
on the other hand , it is important for the peace of mind of thousands of workers , and compatible with the overall amount planned , that the level of aid planned for this financial year for the social chapter for coal should be maintained .
we should look at this again .
the fishermen are inactive , tired and disappointed .
i would ask that we be given the flexibility to achieve that possibility , to achieve the jobs , to achieve the employment and to be able to put the people of northern ireland back to work again , back to work in real politics rather than looking into other reasons as to why they may want to disagree with each other .
the proposal for a regulation which is being examined by parliament today implements these provisions , transposes the community legislation and establishes the office of european data protection supervisor , thereby providing appropriate , tangible guarantees of this fundamental right .
freedom of movement requires effective crime prevention , which is less successful without effective protection of privacy .
we are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied .
in addition to the restrictive reading of article 286 , however , it would have been possible to take article 255 of the treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , while i congratulate mrs paciotti on her excellent work , i would also emphasise the need to move quickly in this field , which was , in fact , the purpose of completing this dossier at first reading .
amendments nos 3 and 11 differ from the council text , but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the council presidency .
the text would be improved if it were amended to make that clear , perhaps this can be done when it is proof-read .
article 299 ( 2 ) primarily expresses a political will , supported on repeated occasions by the european council and , today , by the european parliament .
mr president , the rapporteur , mrs sudre , has done a good job on her report on the outermost regions .
the bulk of the section dealing with fisheries actually consists of an amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .
for more than a decade the european commission has been aware of our problems and our particular characteristics .
the outermost regions bring atlantic , american and african dimensions to europe , which enrich our cultural , political and economic diversity , of which we are all rightly proud .
tomorrow they may become a laboratory providing the finest illustration of the effectiveness of the experiment of the european social model .
just as you , mrs sudre , as the representative of the outermost regions , rightly call for solidarity , i would also request solidarity on your part where the interests of the objective 1 regions are concerned , in the sense that no reductions in funds should be implemented for as long as the regions concerned are still handicapped in comparison with the developed regions of europe .
under this article , the outermost regions obtained recognition by the european union of a genuine right to be different , a right to be dealt with on a specific and special basis reflecting their unique situation , a situation that is completely different to that of the rest of the european union .
this is the message that i wanted to put across , as well as once again congratulating mrs sudre and all the members of the various committees , which have enabled us to get as far as this report today .
this balance , ladies and gentlemen , must be sought initially on a case-by-case basis .
in the field of agriculture , we are preparing the reform of the implementing regulations for measures under the posei programmes .
quite the opposite , i think that these new technologies , internet access , and all the employment opportunities related to these are a great opportunity for the remote or outermost regions .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
i wonder whether in fact there should be some provision in the rules for that .
in any case , ladies and gentlemen , we will discuss the matter at the next bureau meeting .
it will be within a small headquarters , professionally run , accessible to the commission and parliament , although the site is not for now .
the more than eighty measures from the white paper are therefore indispensable .
food safety is a global task ; we should not cut ourselves off from produce from the united states or developing countries .
it must be independent with regard to the member states , the european institutions and the agro-food industry .
this has to be called an `` authority '' because in english and most other languages , that conveys a body which has the power and ability from time to time in the process of risk assessment to use its best judgment and not merely to be the agent of what others would wish it to do .
in this connection , i should like to speak up for cheap food of the kind which families with children buy and which children and young people eat .
secondly , the bowis report clearly states that the european food safety agency is responsible for risk analysis .
the member states have risen to the situation , like france , which has set up a national food safety agency .
that is one of the areas of diversity that makes up the richness of europe and its quality of life .
that is precisely what the who does for us : working with its regional organisations in a wholly integrated manner .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur , mr bowis has produced an excellent report , and in many areas i would like to reinforce what he has said .
we need to apply stricter legislation , stricter guidelines and stricter criteria to animal feed .
i therefore want to discuss amendment no 16 .
the community is the world 's largest importer and exporter of food .
in short , it will be important to see how its independence and transparency are reconciled with the fact that no current resources have been allocated to it , with its subordination to the commission , on the one hand , and with its authority to act autonomously and the membership of its board of directors on the other .
the establishment of a european food safety agency will contribute greatly to achieving a high level of protection of citizens ' health .
i have tabled an amendment which is not unimportant , in my view , although mr whitehead suggested it was redundant .
in my view , nothing less will restore consumer confidence in an important policy area both for producers and consumers .
from now on , the policy will be tackled in a coordinated and integrated manner and will embrace the entire food chain .
this is why we need this food authority and this is why we are right to set the necessary store by it .
for that reason , i support amendment nos 14 and 19 , which express a desire for principled guidance in deciding a future location .
in my opinion , that was a wise policy .
allow me to highlight a number of points .
mr president , while the european food chain is one of the safest in the world , poor practice , and indeed recent scandals , have set an agenda to which our commissioner , mr byrne , has responded admirably .
there are already very many organisations and institutions , not to mention associations and initiatives , concerned with food safety .
making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly .
as mr blokland rightly says , almost certainly not .
i particularly wish to stress that the agency and the present system of advisory committees can not exist side by side .
i therefore call upon the commissioner to avoid excessive legislation and bureaucratic burdens as far as possible , particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned .
i hope that this will be given due consideration in the new proposal .
indeed , the food authority is conceived as a point of scientific excellence at the service of the community in its broadest sense : consumers , the institutions and member states alike .
it is right and proper and i support parliament 's desire to see articles 95 and 152 of the treaty employed to this effect .
certainly , much remains to be done , and this is why we must all welcome the commission 's proposal as a positive step .
in this sense , there must be a sharp focus on the issue and actions must be undertaken to further raise awareness in order to prevent the matter fading into obscurity .
in this field , too , the commission can and should play an invaluable role , and it should tell us what it proposes to do in future in this context .
our question to the commission is intended to encourage it to continue down this path and to strengthen this initiative still further .
i should also like to mention the key role played by civil society , by highly motivated non-governmental organisations and , in particular , by the international campaign to ban landmines .
we have to acknowledge the specific situation in certain countries .
turning now specifically to the bonino report , i would like to comment briefly on the very few amendments by parliament which the commission has some difficulty in taking on board in their current form .
as well as pursuing local capacity-building and ownership , we must be able to draw on the best existing expertise and material wherever it is available .
we should concentrate our political attention on the real culprits : warring factions and irresponsible governments who have shown no concern about civil populations and who use anti-personnel landmines as indiscriminate weapons of terror .
top-level commitment , proper direction and management with responsibility are the keys to the effective use of resources .
i believe that , as far as that is concerned , you and parliament are on the same side .
finally , i should like to thank mrs bonino .
we must bear this in mind because it seems to me , as far as the balkans are concerned , that the west and the european union must take their share of the responsibility , as the result of their political interventions , for the fact that half the balkans are a total minefield .
one point that ngo representatives have criticised in conversation with me is the combination of military activity with ngo work found in points 11 and 15 of the resolution .
it is imperative for a ban to be imposed on producing mines in the eu and on exporting mines from the eu .
i believe it is healthy to strengthen the civil obligations of any organisation which has military activities .
the titley report , which we voted on a few days ago , basically represents a second step forward on questions of common foreign , defence and security policy which will , i believe , slowly but surely build up into a global policy for the european union with flesh on its bones in the form of uniform terms and uniform rules .
mr president , one day in december 1992 , a young shepherd in mozambique forgot the risk : he thought it had gone with the coming of peace .
whatever the outcome , we will all of us together show that we are determined to fight against what has to be called ' a cowards ' war ' .
finland can not be put in the same category as many less developed countries , where the use of mines is very random and the inevitable consequences of that are evident .
finland herself is responsible for her credible defence arrangement .
our efforts over all these years have been to this end , including in 1998 when the north-south centre of the council of europe , over which i have the honour of presiding , awarded its annual prize to mr axworthy , minister for foreign affairs in canada , for the efforts of his government which took concrete form in the ottawa convention .
i can not resist the pleasure of indulging in terms , or rather coining phrases , worthy of those used in the report in order to condemn your repeated e-pocrisy regarding employment and social protection .
in our capacity as swedish liberals , we see european integration as a possible way of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across the borders , human rights and conflict management .
furthermore , the request that there should be a legal basis for ngos to regulate a `` civil dialogue '' is not acceptable .
the only area in which it is precise is on the right of ownership and entrepreneurial freedom , which only concerns owners of capital .
thus those who would like to see parliament become an ` echo chamber ' for the more populous countries ' revisionist intentions will be defeated .
the biarritz summit was heralded as the decisive summit which would affirm fundamental rights , all rights , even rights never conceived of previously , as if the european communities and their constituent states had hitherto lived in total chaos .
i agree with what mr berthu has said , that the idea of a single state with a single constitution completely undermines the national sovereignty of the member states .
we nonetheless agree with the report when it points out that , in their present wording , the treaties leave a lot to be desired in terms of simplicity and transparency .
this choice should be made independently and freely and should not have to depend on an imposed measure that might clash with the constitutional practice of an individual country .
it is not built for the people , for there is not a single word on the social content of europe .
a constitution would commit the member states to venturing onto very dangerous ground , which could lead a constitutional court to gradually deprive the nations of the prerogatives the states intend to continue exercising .
the principle of the separation of powers and the rule of law
we welcome attempts to improve them .
that is why we must fervently hope that the nice summit and the intergovernmental conference prove a success , so as to enable us , quite simply , to make further progress very rapidly .
in this way , mr gil-robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy .
in reality , the european parliament is practising delay tactics .
however , as these provisions now stand , this mechanism can not function correctly .
there is a need for institutional equality in the context of the negotiations on the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .
they are not leader groups but reflect a diversity which , with 30 member states , will only increase .
the pensioners ' party and the pensioners who support it are very familiar with these islands for they are a key tourist destination .
when our regions , in the west indies for example , or the pacific , are tax havens used by the american multinationals , from kodak to microsoft , boeing or cargill , for massive tax-fraud exports , then the right to geographically equal competition , together with the right of all europeans to equality , requires that we devote part of the european budget , in which taxes make up 17 % of revenue , to developing the economic , social and cultural life of our compatriots who live in regions that may well be outermost in terms of geography but are central in terms of civilisation .
in any case , we have , however , subordinated our repugnance for this topic ' s colonial backdrop to the interests of those living in the regions concerned .
the use of animal meal , which is triggering a new food crisis , is unacceptable .
at first glance , the commission 's white paper on food safety appears to be full of good intentions , since it mainly proposes the creation of a european food safety agency responsible for managing a rapid alert network and totally independent when it advises the management authorities .
that is not at all the view of the white paper , which calls for the agency to develop very close working links with the commission services because , as it explains with a certain aplomb , `` it will allow the authority ( agency ) to be responsive to the needs of the commission services '' ( page 20 ) .
if we take a look at recent events , we find that with regard to bse , for example , and taking only the case of france , it is the existence of a competent and independent national food safety agency that allowed the french authorities to rapidly take the decisions needed to protect the health of its people .
as you know , there have been attacks on synagogues in several european countries in the last few days .
you see , if we accept one single amendment - you know this , fellow delegates know it , i have said it more than once - then we will , as it were , already be in breach of the interinstitutional agreement , because we will then have gone over the margin for payments .
here it is intended to place the total amount against the line - so there are no longer any reserves - and at the same time , the appropriations are to be increased by eur 300 000 to 1.8 million .
if i am being honest , i feel we are to some extent deceiving the electorate .
section iv , court of justice
i simply propose this minor correction , if nobody opposes it .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is not reasonable for approximately half of the union ' s total budget each year to be spent on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products .
we must dedicate ourselves to upholding the european ideals of inclusiveness and democracy and resist the pressure of those groups that wish to maintain an anti-european monopolistic control .
- ( sv ) as swedish and danish social democrats , we have today voted in favour of parliament ' s proposal on the eu budget for the budget year 2001 .
however , this revision must not , as is quite possible , result in further substantial cuts in the agriculture sector .
considerable sums have already been awarded to the bosses in this sector , allowing them to diversify into juicy new sectors , while many workers - whose jobs have been eliminated - are still unemployed .
a high quality european public service must be imposed , to include mobiles phones and the internet , to meet the basic needs of employees and users .
the danish social democrats have voted against a report that would remove the subsidies paid to the producers of processed fruit and vegetables .
in a bid to safeguard industrial peace in urban areas , the price of the food package has been kept artificially low for dozens of years now .
it is now absolutely vital for the portuguese government not to give in and for it to staunchly defend its specific national interests on each of these points .
i believe that we can only help these states if we improve the conditions in which all their inhabitants live , be they young people , workers or members of a group very close to my heart , the elderly people and pensioners who live in the acp states .
we disagree with this measure because , whichever way you look at it , the ` polluter pays ' principle is a hypocritical principle and its distorted application will ensure that the entire cost of reducing emissions is passed on directly to consumers , i.e. to the workers .
i fear that the forthcoming climate conference will be exploited as an opportunity to moderate the previously agreed commitment to reduce emission levels by 5.2 % in the rich countries .
moreover the development of nuclear energy and carbon sinks must be excluded from the calculations for the reduction of emissions .
if these chemical substances really cause an increase in certain types of cancer , reduce fertility or threaten unborn life , something has to be done about it .
listing and studying the phenomenon of disruption of the endocrine systems of men and animals , validating the studies , and demonstrating the causal links between certain products and certain anomalies found in humans and animals ( decline in fertility , certain malformations , certain cancers ) , is a necessary point of departure as long as it respects the precautionary principle and at the same time promotes a need for transparency totally absent from the text .
in order for this standardisation process to work , we need coordination .
moreover , volume and number of retail payments only form a small percentage of the total number of credit transfers .
at that time we had to note on the one hand that freight transport had been made considerably easier , but that on the other there were still major barriers and costs associated with making the corresponding payments .
in the european parliament in our work in committee , we also very much regretted the fact that the offer made by the european central bank was not accepted .
what is becoming important - and the report rightly refers to this - is consumer preference for electronic payments , and here we call for progress to be made so that here too an interoperable multi-currency standard for electronic purses can actually be introduced .
consumers are discouraged from shopping internationally .
the documents i have looked at put their share as low as 0.2 % to 0.04 % .
it is only right that the banking sector should be tackled and given a stiff talking to , for while the most important techniques and standards are in place , there is still no flexibility in sight for cross-border credit transfers for amounts up to eur 50 000 .
just as mrs randzio-plath said , we can not order banks to reduce charges as a result of political decisions .
we in brussels are of course experiencing this ourselves as members , but our colleagues are too , that we do not make transfers abroad because of the high charges linked to the euro .
after the european passport , this is the second concrete proof , which will actually make a tangible difference on a day-to-day basis , that we all belong to the european union .
the rapporteur ' s report also focuses on the declarations of statistical data which banks need to produce for each cross-border transfer .
the next item is the report ( a5-0267 / 2000 ) by mrs montfort on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , on the proposal for a council decision on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship , 2001-2005 [ com ( 2000 ) 256 - c5-0274 / 2000 - 2000/0107 ( cns ) ] .
i hope the vote in this house will replicate the unanimity shown in the committee on industry .
greater differentiation ought to be possible here ; the regions need to be involved if we are to get an accurate picture of the impact of enterprise-friendly policies .
and , along those lines , we too have tabled and pressed for a series of strong , concrete proposals for moving from words to deeds , in relation to smes , by giving them access to innovation and electronic commerce , simplifying certain customs formalities for them , ending certain disparities in administration and regulations , developing - and this is important - access to risk capital , developing the euro info centres to broaden the scope of business information and support , and making the framework programme for research and technological development more open to innovative smes .
the effective implementation of the acquis is necessary to ensure that enlargement becomes a win-win situation for the member states and candidate countries alike .
we must encourage them , promote local development using local resources , both material and human , and foster their relations with local communities .
mr president , commissioner , small and medium-sized businesses , both in the manufacturing and in the service sectors , can only survive on the market if they have full order books .
in our opinion , a third point of concern is the protection of intellectual property rights at european level .
we all know that the pace at which we live our lives has become faster because we use mobile telephones , e-mail and the internet , and this opens up entirely new possibilities .
the explanatory statement emphasises that the term sme can equally relate to a business employing up to 500 employees and to a craft business employing only two or three people and that , taken all together , these represent 99 % of the union ' s businesses .
because of its financial limitations , i think the multiannual programme merely acknowledges the problem and gives a positive political bearing and encouragement , but is not in a position to give any substantial help or , more importantly , to reverse the prevalent trends in the present economy , which are literally crushing small enterprises in every sector .
the problem in small and medium-sized businesses is that they do not have a lot of resources to go out and get information , to find out what grants and help are available , to do the sort of administrative tasks that are increasingly being imposed upon them by national governments .
account should be taken of that in implementing the programme but there are no grounds for mentioning them separately in the legislative text .
the multiannual programme will be committed to improving the modus operandi of small and medium-sized businesses .
border fortifications and repressive policing measures will not stem the tide of those seeking a share of the prosperity which we all enjoy .
i think that this is a shame , although what the group has done is not wrong because it touches on the right problems and also tries to point out the right possible solutions .
to achieve this , measures are needed which work in two different directions .
recently , we have , thank heavens , seen positive signals emerging from that part of the balkans that has an indirect impact on albania .
it is very sad to realise that , today in western europe , we are trying to create laws that would punish those who are hiding anne frank ' s unborn grandchildren .
the issue of schools and child reception must be addressed .
what happened is proof positive that the european union ' s aim must be to establish structures which will ensure that democratic rules are respected and that the rights of minorities in albania are recognised and respected .
for this to be the case , it is absolutely essential to draw up plans for a coordinated repatriation operation and , above all , to involve non-governmental and international organisations .
economic growth enables difficulties to be overcome in crisis areas .
this is an awareness that we must all help to foster .
mr president , the conclusions of the european council at tampere called for firmer external action in the area of legal and internal affairs .
i wish to raise three points for consideration , which the commission regards as particularly important .
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market explicitly calls on the commission to resist the legislative pressure to which it has itself objected .
we want a strong union which takes full responsibility for the tasks incumbent on it , which creates a well-functioning internal market and which actually makes it possible to strengthen social and regional cohesion .
i was delighted to note that amendments nos 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , which i tabled myself , have been approved by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
'' i hear similar things from residents of the island of islay , where the proposal for the protection of the local seal colony by a grand international body is resented , because the people have looked after the seals better for the last 2000 years than we think a grander organisation is likely to do in the future .
they must be asked to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
the second paragraph of article 5 of the treaty establishing the european economic community is utterly unintelligible .
regardless of the reasons that may have caused this mistake , it is certain that it is motivated by the constant initiatives , originating in the commission , that are carried out with regard to legislation .
in other words , mr president , the principle of subsidiarity is probably the principle that fuses , brings together and sums up what the building of europe is all about , because ultimately it is nothing but the political will that is included in the treaty .
actually , this screening of the existing acquis communautaire is often a very useful exercise in showing that it is not always necessary to legislate at community level or whether a law is too detailed for legislation at the community level .
i hope that we can continue this debate so that it is not only a routine matter on thursday afternoon but part of the central debate on community legislation as a whole .
these charges still exist , both for exchanging cash and for making cross-border payments .
his passivity is the best guarantee for permanent charges and continuing frustration .
faced with this situation and the imminence of negotiations which might begin next monday in brussels , i do not think the commission will give us much information today , due to the fact that it will do this - we hope - on monday 30 october .
from this rostrum and with the weight of representing european democracy on our shoulders , i call for good sense and wisdom from both parties , who will meet in brussels on 30 october at the highest level - the european fisheries commissioner and the moroccan minister for fisheries if , as i hope , his attendance in brussels is confirmed , and the technical delegations , with the moroccan secretary of state for foreign affairs of morocco , if this too is confirmed , with the director-general for fisheries of the european union as chair - so that serious dialogue may take place and solutions be found .
mr president , commissioner , tomorrow it will be exactly a year since our last debate here in parliament on the subject of morocco .
i wish the commissioner all the luck in the world and bid a very warm welcome to the moroccan delegation .
moroccan agriculture enjoys special treatment when exporting to europe .
the fishermen in particular can not be blamed for not understanding the situation and for being very disappointed about the fact that the negotiations concerning the morocco agreement have dragged on .
mr president , we are debating the third agreement with morocco , which above all concerns french and portuguese fishermen , who make up the bulk of the fleet , even though a small number of french and swedish fishermen are also concerned .
it is actually easier to defend the suburbs than it is to defend morocco .
as this key date is so close , i believe that we must be extremely careful with what is drawn up .
we are talking about a territory that does not belong to morocco , but that is being administrated by morocco .
mr president , this is not the first time that the right to fish in moroccan and saharan waters has been an item on parliament ' s agenda .
firstly , it must be emphasised that the fishing agreement with morocco is by far the european union ' s most important agreement , representing more than 30 % of all catches by the community fleet in third-country waters .
mr president , commissioner , i am not going to repeat what has been said this morning in this plenary sitting and has been being said for almost a year .
historically , it is neighbours that seem to have so much trouble with each other and the idea of the european union is to resolve problematic relations with neighbours .
i think that if we manage to persuade morocco to take a european outlook , then morocco will do what it should have done long ago , i.e. it will discuss the question of natural resources , of common resources with us and will stop giving preference to ships from third countries .
thank you , commissioner .
but it is not about language teachers ; it is all about an example , in this case about a citizens ' europe .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the case of non-italian foreign language assistants in italian universities is well known in the commission and in most european institutions .
each member state is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service .
what is this injustice ?
mr president , politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance , or how strong its moral base , there is no legal remedy .
nobody disputes that the italian republic is fully within its entitlement , in 1995 or at any other time , to say for the future we will not hire people as lettori , we will bring in people for a new kind of appointment .
so far the european commission has proven unwilling to enforce the treaties when the number of people affected are few .
we support the internal economic market .
we are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the court of justice will give its opinion as soon as possible .
this said , i hope that our debate will go some way to promoting an equitable solution for language teachers in italy .
ladies and gentlemen , as you will be aware , last month saw the names of four more victims being added to the intolerable list of those who have lost their lives in spain as a result of terrorist attacks by eta .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral to committee ?
it would therefore merely be a matter of bringing forward the vote .
mr barã ³ n crespo , i would like to make sure i understand you correctly .
i would appeal to everyone that you at least make sure you know what you are signing if you sign this petition .
70 % of irish lorries , irish transporters , must go to , or through , the uk land bridge to europe .
( a5-0313 / 2000 ) by mr marinho , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the initiative of the french republic with a view to adopting a council framework decision on money laundering , the identification , tracing , freezing , seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime [ 10232/2000 - c5-0393 / 2000 - 2000/0814 ( cns ) ] ,
the fight against money laundering is , of course , one of the union ' s most important priorities , as rightly identified at the tampere summit last year .
in conclusion , parliament has considered attentively and positively this portuguese initiative but we are unsatisfied with the limited scope of the proposed revision of the europol convention .
article 6 , for its part , provides for the making of supplementary requests for mutual assistance , and article 7 states that fiscal exceptions can no longer constitute a reason for refusing mutual assistance .
as i have said , that is why i support the proposals on the table today but , at the same time , i would take this opportunity to give you advance notice that there will be a real battle with the council over the common position on the second directive to combat money laundering .
were the european police force to be offered this heaven-sent chance of potential self-regulation , it would do its utmost to curb the european parliament ' s vague desire for democratic control , given the current deficiencies at organisational level and the lack of unity on the background issues .
i welcome this debate .
it has to be by a majority vote - we propose two-thirds - and we also want parliamentary involvement in the dismissal of the director , if ever that becomes necessary , by a two-thirds vote as well .
it would have full public support and it is necessary for the future .
what i should like to know is if there is a country in europe or area in the world , such as the usa , which already has a single area of justice and which has effectively combated the problem of money laundering , or are we endeavouring , ostensibly in order to combat a real problem , to communitise crucial institutions which are bound up with the national independence and grass-roots sovereignty of the member states ?
this report includes a recital on the geneva appeal , and the group of the european people ' s party will vote against it , not because we are against the geneva appeal , but simply because as parliament we must ensure the quality of legislation .
however , we must not forget to provide europol with sufficient staff and funding so that it is actually able to assume the responsibilities which we are assigning it .
the aim of this framework decision is to combat the major crimes that are at the root of money laundering , not small crimes punishable by a lesser sentence , which , if considered within the scope of this framework decision , could negate its very purpose .
this is where member states , through police and judicial cooperation , can act most effectively to combat organised crime .
to be frank , however , i do not think that this initiative is the appropriate occasion to be adopting decisions in this field .
i may paint a gloomy picture , but we do have reason for hope .
the gebhardt report places special emphasis on these three points .
the member states of the european community subscribe to these on the basis of their existing legislative , executive and legal systems , in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values .
like mrs palacio , we hope that the provisional unit for judicial cooperation will soon cease to be provisional , but we radical members are not prepared to repeat our experience with europol , when the establishment of the drugs unit led to the creation of a continually changing and expanding superbody which was out of the democratic control of national and european parliaments .
it must be founded upon common values and have broad political support .
without a certain degree of cooperation , it is simply not possible for us to uphold a law-governed society in an eu with freedom of movement .
criminals must be left in no doubt as to this supranationality .
the commission welcomes your report , mrs gebhardt .
part of this is , of course , also ex post evaluation , even if , in this case , it has definitely come rather late .
i nonetheless assume , not least with a view to my hobbyhorse of fisheries , that we will put pressure on all three of them together so that we can guarantee positive developments in the future .
it is sufficient to suggest that we need to look at the whole procedure again , not just in terms of the court ' s annual report which will be published tomorrow , but also in terms of special reports such as this one .
i should just like to touch on a few points which are , in my opinion , decisive for the future work of monitoring research in general .
i must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected .
i would nevertheless like to stress one thing , which is that joint financial responsibility can not , in a strict sense , be envisaged within the context of the framework programme , the aim of which is to set up consortia composed of various bodies , universities , smes , large companies , and public or private research institutes .
the process is therefore under way , but we are now entering the domain of member state jurisdiction and can not always dictate how long things will take .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
madam president , as a member of the european parliament from salzburg , allow me to start by thanking you for your words of acknowledgement and comfort yesterday .
this charter will , i think , need to be supplemented in the future , if it is to become the foundation stone of a european constitution .
this is quite clearly a major political decision and a fresh opportunity to show the citizens of europe the whole scope of this initiative .
so , the charter is a perfectly consistent text .
i am sure the convention members that are to speak here will be able to confirm that .
i clearly heard your rapporteurs once again expressing the desire to see the charter form the preamble to a constitutional treaty and you know that i , personally , am in favour of this , but i should like to point out , because we are bound to be extremely precise regarding what is happening today , that the european council in biarritz was forced to note that the majority of member states were not willing to discuss the matter of incorporating this charter into the treaties , at least for the time being .
i should like on behalf of our group to offer express thanks not only to all the members of our group but , most of all , to vice-president ingo friedrich , who coordinated our work .
the european union has long been more than an economic community .
this is our proposal .
it took many weeks of battling to incorporate the right to strike into the charter .
secondly , because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the union .
therefore , we feel that the charter is only important as a position of principle , as a starting point for a debate : a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop , which must take place alongside the unification process .
behind the vote on the charter , there is an ill-concealed agenda to create the first part of a constitution for what might be called a united states of europe .
and we want a europe which blossoms , prospers and grows , which is why we wanted and were right to refer to our roots .
let me briefly discuss the scope of the text .
such respect , combined with a ban on discrimination , creates a basis for securing the position of minorities in the future .
nothing in life is perfect and it is also not perfect to declare rights but not uphold them effectively .
it is never too late to set things right .
i feel that the present charter is nothing but a poor imitation in that it raises legal concerns such as the point in article 2 , paragraph 2 , where it states `` no one shall be condemned to the death penalty , or executed '' .
just one last word to the president-in-office : as a former member of a supreme court , i can assure you that if the jurisdiction of various supreme courts overlaps , this will quickly give rise to diverging case law and diverging case law is only to be expected .
i think that the reference to article 6 is logical and i think that the president-in-office of the council should take note of what mr barã ³ n crespo said .
if you think of the fragile political situation in one or two of our member states , that is an important message to be setting out at this time .
this charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the member states and , thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws , it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness .
mr president , the charter gives visible form to existing rights , at the same time as historical steps are being taken on behalf of europe .
mr president , the proposal and adoption of the draft charter of fundamental rights should meet with very broad consensus .
attaque also notes that it ignores trade union rights and that , in actual fact , it is about establishing the free movement of capital .
in this way , the charter provides additional protection for the most vulnerable members of europe ' s society , and that is to be welcomed .
for a start , they must incorporate an amendment to article 6 of the eu treaty .
the debate as to whether the union should not simply accede to the european convention on human rights just as the member states do has gone on for years .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the charter which we are preparing to vote upon today with europeanist conviction is certainly a step forward towards the political integration of europe , in which we firmly believe .
it is important that these two bodies should not lose their authority .
my fellow members on the committee on citizens ' freedoms , and rights , justice and home affairs did me the honour of appointing me rapporteur on the issue of respect for human rights within the europe union .
the charter has many supporters but also many enemies , and we have heard the opinions of those who do not want a political europe .
some find the text excessively binding , even too advanced in relation to a number of reforms which it would be liable to dismantle , while others find it devoid of content or not sufficiently binding .
let me remind you that etuc , for example , representing 60 million employees in europe , was consulted , that several hundred ngos were consulted , that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the convention .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
the european parliament will have to tell its turkish partners very clearly in the debates in that forum that they need have no fear of any european desire to interfere in their internal affairs and that , on the contrary , it is proposing a contract , the precise details of which are being thrashed out , in the accession partnership , commissioner , and , of course , in the convention on the charter of fundamental rights .
if we had wanted to impose conditions they would have had to be imposed last year when the earlier decision was adopted .
i feel that mr morillon ' s excellent report bears witness to your determination to bring turkey ' s pre-accession process to a successful conclusion , while exercising the utmost vigilance , quite legitimately , regarding the still considerable reforms which this country has yet to undertake .
mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to mr morillon and mr seppã $ nen for their highly constructive and politically intelligent reports and to say that this debate is taking place at a most auspicious time , a time when we are in a position to set relations between the european union and turkey on what may prove to be a decisive course .
i agree : we should be worried that there is too little respect for human rights and the rights of minorities , we should be worried about the constitutional role of the army and we are still extremely worried about the situation of the population of kurdish origin and about the state of emergency in the four remaining provinces in the south-east .
here too , i agree in the main with mr morillon 's report .
given that this special programme of eur 450 million , of which the european union is guaranteeing 65 % , specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only eur 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the guarantee fund , there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default , because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in .
at a meeting which i , unfortunately , was unable to attend , my group decided by a majority to support amendment no 25 .
the morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the european union to turkey 's candidature .
in other words , i propose that the european parliament should itself hold a debate on the armenian genocide , the majority will follow on and we shall continue the debate in turkey .
anything else would simply play into the hands of those in the eu and in turkey who oppose this membership .
mr president , the morillon report in itself provides a perfect illustration of the basic contradictions in the european attitude to turkey .
incidentally , the ultranationalist mhp party was in deadly earnest when it underlined ` the superiority of the turkish race ' at its party conference ten days ago .
report ( a5-0279 / 2000 ) by mrs paciotti , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the proposal for a european parliament and council regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the institutions and bodies of the community and on the free movement of such data ( com ( 1999 ) 337 - c5-0149 / 2000 - 1999/0153 ( cod ) )
i would stress that in entrusting this huge power of monitoring the european databases to a monocratic body - notwithstanding the total respect and confidence which we have in the guarantor - we would appear to have momentarily shifted our focus from the central concern of the human person which , in respect of the power of information technology , must be provided with a reference framework of guaranteed rights and freedoms .
and yet there is a need for a set of data protection rules , for the institutions not only process internal data ( such as data relating to their autonomous activities , budget and staff reports ) but also data collected from citizens in the performance of eu duties ( e.g. granting subsidies , investigating competition cases , public tenders , statistical research and studies , data relating to the preparation and implementation of legislation ) .
the charter of fundamental rights of the european union is a far cry from the declaration of human rights of the un , the european convention on human rights and the constitutions of many member states of the european union .
the meps of the communist party of greece voted against this text , which is both useless and dangerous .
articles establishing new obligations without justification .
. sos democracy rejects the charter of fundamental rights on three grounds .
of greatest concern is article 52 , which provides for the rights referred to elsewhere in the document to be set aside where they conflict with the `` general interest recognised by the union '' .
this is the way in which it will gradually pervade , through case law , all our national and european legal systems !
furthermore , i would have preferred a charter that did not merely stipulate the ` rights ' of citizens but also their ` duties ' towards society .
everyday topical events , from maritime transport to animal meal , show us that the markets and economic operators must be much better regulated and controlled and that established short-term profit-making interests must be opposed .
given that only have two options , my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this charter represents , however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text .
the difference between not prohibiting access to work and taking action to make it possible to work is more than just a shade of meaning .
nonetheless , it does not substantiate the eu 's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens .
in this catalogue of rights , the devotees of european federalism see the embryo of a future european constitution , which the member states ' national constitutions will have to accommodate .
from start to finish , the framing of the charter gave rise to a series of takeovers by force :
the lot of processes of this nature is to produce texts which necessarily boil down to the lowest common denominator .
the arguments put forward by the european parliament are completely fallacious .
in any case , the fight against money laundering takes place on a number of levels and , to start with , we see no need to establish maximum and minimum penalties for this at community level .
yet they clearly run counter to the interests of human beings and the conservation of our environment .
this will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across europe .
there you are . this is an example of what i hope will not happen when this document is implemented .
gebhardt report ( a5-0317 / 2000 )
( the sitting was suspended at 12.52 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
turkey has not come so far as had been hoped .
the residual guarantee fund reserve is now so low that it may prevent the union from using the eib as an instrument if new events should occur , requiring initiatives of this nature .
this is the first serious step on the road towards turkey 's accession and the accession process can now move into the practical application stage .
until that happens i do not think this parliament should act differently .
turkey must come to terms with the truth .
as far as the armenian genocide is concerned i fully agree that it should not be a precondition to turkey 's accession .
our rapporteur , mr morillon , deserves our congratulations for stipulating that a solution to the cyprus problem must be one of the preconditions for turkey ' s accession .
there are also positive references to cyprus , with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn , to the need to implement the decisions of the european court , as in the loã ¯ zidou case , to the need for a political solution to the kurdish question and to the bombings in iraq .
this , it seems to me , is precisely the balance advocated by mr morillon ' s report .
it is not my place to give parliament advice or to criticise - nor shall i do so .
i should like to thank mr brok for allowing me to give an assessment of the current state of the european union ' s mediterranean policy since this is , as you know , the eve of the fourth conference of foreign ministers from the euro-mediterranean partnership , which is to be held in marseilles .
indeed , when we instigated the partnership in 1995 , we were aware that we were undertaking a long-term project .
mr brok mentioned financial resources .
mr president , it is a sign of the president-in-office 's competence that he has answered questions which i have not even asked .
we should try and help to give the people of palestine the chance to decide their own fate , forge their own future and build their own state on the basis of agreement with and the security of the state of israel .
we in fact completed our negotiations with egypt almost 18 months ago and i wish that we could now rapidly proceed to initialling the agreement and then in due course to full signature .
in the next few years the success of that partnership will be even more important than ever and i hope that , at marseilles this week and in subsequent weeks , we manage to ensure that this whole enterprise has even more impulse and energy in it than it has had in the past .
in fact , we observe that the still-prevailing bilateral dimension , which is anything but easy to negotiate and takes a long time to ratify , is in danger of increasingly shaping the economies of these countries on the basis of their trade with the union , hampering the development of the south-south dimension , especially because of the partner countries ' difficulty in establishing mutual cooperative relations .
a few days ago , in barcelona , at various meetings of the cãrculo de economãa , the secretary general of the council , mr solana , told us that the priorities for european external activity are firstly with our neighbours , and our closest neighbours are the mediterraneans .
next , we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions , but also environmental protection , the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking , emigration and integration , and to make progress towards human rights , as we have requested .
( the president cut the speaker off )
with these conditions in place , it should be possible for the special council in marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the eu .
if current tendencies continue we can be pessimistic about the future .
mr president , i will come back to the conflict in the middle east ; not two months ago , the presidents of the israeli parliament and the palestinian assembly united in this house with the president of the european parliament , in a plea for peace and harmony , and we all joined in hearty applause for that gesture .
marseilles too , the other summit , brought together the members of associations , trade unions and political bodies from all around the mediterranean , and these people were together attempting resolutely to find solutions to meeting the needs of their peoples .
the debate is closed .
however , there are two key aspects of policy i would like to focus on .
in quite concrete terms , this means reducing the influence of the governing board associated with the agency .
it is vital that ngos should collaborate in this field , and also that there should be some coordination among them , if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions .
at the same time , in order to include a specifically cultural angle , not in abstract or generic terms but in terms of solidarity , we have proposed amendments which have found favour in the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy and which , i feel , contribute to providing , on the one hand , economic , civil , supportive assistance while restoring the civil society of these very unfortunate areas and , on the other , the possibility for cultural and institutional - and i stress the word institutional - support , to give these areas a sense of association with europe , association in terms of civilisation , in terms of cultural initiatives , as well .
i also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members , where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time , should be avoided .
a great deal of headway has been made in the space of a year and the internal dynamics in a number of countries are at long last enhancing the role of the international community , even though the kosovo crisis is still fresh in the memory .
their political fate will also depend on how successfully the eu is able to deliver aid .
to this end we have set two aims ; the first is to develop regional cooperation , and the second is to implement a genuine policy to encourage a rapprochement between these countries and the european union .
we would like to see the programmes assigned to it by the commission implemented more efficiently and speedily .
he has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region .
during the european council , within the framework of the report on the development of european facilities for military and civilian crisis management , it was suggested that rapid financing mechanisms , such as the creation by the commission of a rapid reaction fund , should be set up to speed up the provision of finance to support european union activities , to contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund ngo activities , where appropriate .
the constant postponement of the referendum , and the failure of negotiations in berlin on 28 september 2000 , are raising serious concerns and engendering deep disappointment among the people .
whatever the result of the referendum - independence or annexation to morocco - it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively .
the transport of radioactive materials in france is carried out in accordance with the legislation in force and , in particular , council directive 94/55/ec of 21 november 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , and council directive 96/49/ec of 23 july 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail , which apply to the transport of radioactive materials and set out various technical requirements in relation to vehicles , brands and packing .
the european union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries .
the european council in feira last june called upon the council to speed up the implementation of measures combating illegal rings , provided for in the conclusions of the tampere european council of october 1999 .
mr martin is right , as we are indeed concerned with fighting criminal organisations involved in the trafficking of human beings and not reviewing previous texts that enable potential refugees to exercise their right to seek asylum on union territory .
however , these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances .
not this evening , and here i come to my answer , as i know the minister and i can give you the council ' s response .
the term of the head of state and president of the republic , jacques chirac , will , of course , come to an end at vienna , this is clear .
having said that , i should like to make it clear , mrs flemming , that , in general , i like austria and austrian people .
will the council give its response to the assertion in mr cem 's letter that in the partnership agreement there can be no link-up between the cyprus problem and eu-turkey relations and that such a link-up would constitute a violation of the terms of the helsinki conclusions ?
the situation , and i should like a response to it from the minister , is this : first , the helsinki conclusions state that resolving the cyprus problem is not a precondition to the accession of cyprus .
the agreement will also take into consideration the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and aid the development of the moroccan fisheries sector .
the agreement they propose is for two years instead of five , and in addition they want the european union to pay them the esp 21 billion that it is currently paying .
question no 13 by ( h-0854 / 00 ) :
mr president , my point of order is that there remain twenty minutes of question time , there are very few members in the house and there is no risk of exceeding time .
as to energy efficiency , the commission presented an action plan during last may ' s council meeting .
the objective of the european union regarding cuba , as established in the common position on cuba adopted by the council on 2 december 1996 , is to encourage a process of peaceful `` transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the cuban people .
subject : violation by turkey of sovereign rights within nato turkey has , de facto , challenged the sovereign rights of greece by intercepting greek aircraft taking part in nato 's exercise , destined glory , its failure to respect the greek ten-mile fir and the air corridors over the islands of limnos and ikaria , ignoring the opinions of nato 's legal service , and departing from the plans for the exercise drawn up by nato 's administration , which prompted the greek government to withdraw its troops .
i do not know if it was to everyone ' s satisfaction , but it is an almost historic event of which we take good note .
commissioner and the few honourable members who have found their way here , i must , of course , start by congratulating the rapporteurs on their work and excellent cooperation , especially the rapporteur who is here in the house .
but where there is no will , nor should there be money from us .
they create a framework for political initiatives which must be built up into new perceptions .
the member states make grandiose declarations of their intentions but these must be followed by a concrete financial undertaking .
these two proposals respond to two key union priorities : providing assistance to southeastern europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible .
these are the results of which the european parliament too can be proud .
to be clear : we can accept the spirit , provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording , of amendments nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , the first part of 11 , the first part of 13 , 16 partially , 17 , 18 , 19 partially and 20 , 21 , 24 , 28 in the first part , 31 and partially 37 .
thank you commissioner .
they pledged to promote and protect fundamental human rights and uphold respect for democracy , the rule of law , equality , justice and concern for the environment .
finally , leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework .
it is good - i freely admit - that some agreement was reached on a framework programme for cooperation between asia and europe .
we find it incomprehensible that the secretariat for the fellowship programme is to be located in seoul .
this monitoring should be transferred to an unequivocally community body , so that the common fisheries policy can apply to all member states and to all vessels and crews regardless of their nationality , thus avoiding any possible breach of the principle of equal treatment .
it would mean , first of all , not having to confine itself to reacting to actions like that of the galapagos agreement and its manifest intention of unilaterally extending the jurisdictional waters of four countries in defiance of the basic norms of international maritime law , or against attempts to arbitrarily expel community fleets , which are among the few that are governed by strict standards and regulations .
the development of a regionalisation of the cfp will be critical in ensuring local action .
we are backing the regional fisheries organisations ; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the commission to have more weight in them .
this is an extremely difficult position to have to try to find a way through .
the commission therefore stands by its conclusion in the communication that , as far as controls are concerned , nafo is an exceptional case and should not become the rule .
com in pigmeat
accordingly , the commission has proposed incorporating a new tool into the com : regulatory funds .
the last one caused prices to fall by over 30 % from mid-1998 to early 2000 .
the fact is that the pigfarming sector has been the only sector which has until now been able to compete on market conditions with just a relatively few forms of intervention such as export subsidies and private storage , and it must continue to do so .
this is a model just like the american model .
this is an honest and credible endeavour and i shall recommend that my group vote in favour .
in this way , far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice , with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving , at reasonable cost , towards what is practised in certain third countries , such as the insurance-cum-income systems in force in the united states and canada .
the way i understand it is that voluntary funds in the future will help to ensure there is also balanced marketing in the pig industry .
mr president , the really positive thing about this debate is that we are getting a very clear idea of what can be regulated within the common agricultural policy and what can not .
it is clear from market developments that , as ever , the pig cycle is exerting its influence and still applies and that good times will again follow bad .
more importantly , we must not forget that in numerous countries farmers fatten their piglets themselves and hence have direct access to the compensation fund via the fattened pigs which they sell .
the debate is closed .
since the last discharge procedure the court has adopted 24 special reports containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the community 's financial management can be improved .
this reflection leads me to some comments on the reform of the commission .
the court of auditors quite rightly applies very high standards to the way tax-payers ' money is used , and the commission is following these high standards in its own financial management reform .
it is , of course , emphasised that it is the european commission 's job both to avoid formal errors and to combat fraud , especially as people keep asking where the dividing lines lie and where things blend together .
mrs schreyer 's report was just as interesting .
a solution needs to be found here , and i would like to ask you , mrs schreyer , if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged .
we are told that this can not be properly calculated .
once and for all , we can say : ` here are the problem areas , and we want to find solutions ' .
the member states avoid responsibility , misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and , every time criticisms are made , a storm of criticism rains down upon those in brussels , that is to say the commission and others .
i also call upon the ministers , heads of state and government to endorse the proposal for a european public ministry at the nice summit .
proper management and control procedures , lack of planning , inadequate evaluations , loose or non-existent eligibility criteria frequently feature in this report .
i should be grateful if the court would issue its opinion on the reform of the financial regulation soon .
but i find that the work of the court of auditors has not been done sufficiently well to help us to do our job .
the whole process will take time .
this headline relates to a press conference by mr friedmann , and i must ask , mr karlsson , why members of the court of auditors are making different statements , first in our committee on budgetary control and then apparently to the press .
i would like to congratulate the commission , and commissioner schreyer in particular , on the court 's observation that many of the changes it has requested are being implemented or are on the way to being implemented .
finally , mr karlsson , while we , as a parliament , make all these changes , perhaps you could go and help america count its votes !
the court of auditors was asked - and a number of speakers have reminded us of this morning - to explicitly name the member states in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered .
these are excellent , high-quality documents , which are a `` drop in the ocean '' in a common agricultural policy that still gives special treatment to larger farmers at the expense of the smaller ones and to countries and regions at the heart of europe at the expense of peripheral countries and regions .
i am extremely happy .
it was quite clear , in this particular case , that the court of first instance supported us by saying we not only have the right to mention these names but also a duty to do so .
thank you very much , mr karlsson .
another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow-up services .
for this simple reason we have expressed a different viewpoint , and we can only advise this chamber , on behalf of a majority of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , to accept amendments nos 38 or 41 in particular , as these relate to a weakening of export bans .
for example , in many sectors , products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer , with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers .
in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , under the wise guidance of our rapporteur , we passed a series of amendments which , again , my group would commend en bloc to the house today .
our amendments nos 1 , 8 and 18 bear on that point .
there is a proposal to scrap this idea , one of the considerations being that producers should not have to incriminate themselves , and also in the light of professional secrecy .
by its very nature , the service industry is less suited to this approach .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her work , which addresses the fundamental concerns of consumers ' associations , which must be accepted as equal partners in a constructive dialogue .
in other sectors , this directive has been extended to other fields of application .
although the review and revision of the directive are formally required by the directive itself , this coincides with the reinforced commitment by the commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers .
this is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors and especially with imported products .
the only new requirement is that distributors , within the limits of their respective activities , are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tracing the origin of products .
amendment no 7 proposes certain changes in the references to paragraphs .
these are civil law aspects , regulated by the directive on product liability , and should not , therefore , be dealt with here .
this is not acceptable , as these directives often lack provisions on market surveillance , notification systems and so on .
that is not acceptable as this is a key improvement in comparison to the existing directive .
on 30 june 2000 , at the end of a meeting of the bureau , of which i was a member but where a few close colleagues discussed my case , in my absence and without my knowledge , mr barã ³ n crespo informed me that i had excluded myself from his group .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the first one was from mr katiforis about the word nato , and the second question was about whether the present order is correct as shown .
- ( el ) the mediterranean has always been , and still is , a particularly sensitive region with serious political , economic and social problems .
the question of financing also requires a will to succeed which has thus far not been displayed .
mr president , despite the progress made in recent years within the european union , within this europe that champions human rights , structural discrimination on the grounds of sex still exists .
the only reason why it is becoming widespread is the desire of companies to make ever greater profits .
furthermore , i think that a `` media code of conduct '' is impractical .
as i left , i said to her , `` do n't worry : we are going to debate the gonzã ¡ lez ã  lvarez report which deals precisely with product safety '' .
let us not forget that it was my labour colleague , mr whitehead , who introduced the amendments exempting charity shops , and we should congratulate him on his achievements .
amendment no 14 weakens the governing board vis-ã - vis the commission , by stipulating that its decisions are adopted by simple majority .
- ( el ) the remit of the european agency for reconstruction should have been extended to the federal republic of yugoslavia a long time ago and should not be linked to the internal changes in yugoslavia .
parliament ' s report will introduce still more aid schemes .
we do not have a market organisation for pigmeat comparable with those for other agricultural products .
there is no point in setting up funds to ameliorate the effects of recurring crises .
this goes to show that one disaster can trigger off the next .
european governments do not want to offend turkish reactionaries who refuse to abolish the death penalty and trample women ' s rights underfoot . nor do they want to offend the turkish authorities who now oppress the kurdish people after having already massacred the armenian population .
the progress reports established by the european commission are therefore extremely important .
i voted for this motion for a resolution .
sadly , many issues are still unresolved such as those related to the kurdish and armenian situations and to full respect for civil rights , although a great deal of progress has been made in these fields .
nonetheless , the system that has been put in place will do its work and will impose its logic on us until the time comes when this awkward position will become so untenable that our relations with turkey will be in serious and deep crisis .
mr president , as you are aware , the news is spreading throughout the world of fish that i am promoting their cause .
the rapporteur 's answer is for the community to be given the resources , effectively , to take direct control over fisheries monitoring .
some member states are not at all involved in certain fishing regions .
the need for conciliation soon became apparent because , as it turned out , the council was not minded to adopt these amendments .
mr president , i share at least one certainty with the rapporteur , mr blokland : incineration may be a significant source of pollution but it is in fact necessary today , given the very low levels of waste recycling .
first and foremost , a significant contribution has now been made to reducing discharges of hazardous and polluting substances produced by incineration - substances which are very harmful to people ' s health and which damage the environment .
in some countries the best alternative , environmentally speaking , is that carefully sorted combustible waste can be burned in small municipal plants that produce electricity and heating .
in particular , i welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on incineration plants and the obligation on plant operators to publish an annual report on emissions .
the work of the countries to hold the presidency , portugal and france , was constructive , and we have to mention in particular the role of the commission , which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result .
burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste , due to the waste hierarchy , and the commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy .
the employment and social policy council adopted a european strategy for the fight against social exclusion in luxembourg on 17 october .
however , they are also needed in order to compensate for the increasing shortcomings of national health services as the result of public-sector management , high costs and cutbacks in expenditure by governments , expenditure which has steadily decreased in all the member states during the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s .
that is precisely why it is so important - and in fact this is far and away the most significant achievement of this report - for the commission to produce a green paper on supplementary health insurance in the short term .
the debate on health insurance in the eu must not end up going down a blind alley .
according to this concept , the purpose of the market in profit-making supplementary health insurance schemes is to increasingly and crucially take on the role of supplementing the basic state systems .
it is , of course , the same doctor , the same nurses , the same hospitals and the same resources in the health care sector which are to be used , irrespective of whether it is ordinary or private patients who are being treated .
my sincere congratulations go to the rapporteur , michel rocard .
the national insurance system is not subject to the coordination rules because it is not employees ' insurance and only applies to nationals .
we reject this socially unacceptable reform .
health care is financed in different ways in different member states and the roles of private health insurers are correspondingly different .
articles 34 and 35 of our fledgling european union charter of fundamental rights recognise and respect the entitlement to social security benefits and social services and , at the same time , proclaim the entitlement of everyone residing and moving legally within the union to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with community law and national laws and practices .
financing statutory health care and pension schemes is at the heart of the social and budgetary debate in europe .
this is an upwards trend owing to the reorganisation of the social security systems in certain member states .
today 's green paper becomes tomorrow 's intrusive and damaging legislation .
the commission will immediately launch a study of supplementary health insurance .
i thank you for your understanding during this procedure , which means that we are able to contribute to the european union once again having a programme in this field , despite its limitations and shortcomings .
they should be enabled to gain and update qualifications and skills .
the countries outside the euro area present their convergence programmes , which to a great extent resemble the stability programmes , although the objectives to be achieved are different .
finally , we shall assess to what extent the national budgets presented each year are compatible with more ambitious medium-term strategies for public finances .
in the case of finland , the national debt is already much lower than this target and is falling all the time .
first of all , the proceeds of the umts licences , as i said before , have been allocated to reducing the debt , so that the national debt is now practically down to the 60 % level .
there is no doubt at all that inflation is a worry .
at the moment the impression i have is that the formulas being used in the various member states are moving in three directions .
this action plan places public health and transparency at the top of the agenda , this being a requirement of the french government .
this meeting will compare experiences and approaches with regard to the test programme , the ban on animal meal and other measures that might be reinforced at a european level .
there has been a worrying increase in the number of cases of bse detected in france over the past year , in part due to the introduction of targeted testing .
finally , we must not overlook the huge progress in recent years , in the past year in particular , in putting in place a framework to tackle bse .
the european parliament has been a consistent and strong supporter of such testing and i count on your support for the commission 's approach .
public health and financial considerations , therefore , both argue for strict implementation .
my only concern in relation to the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether it is safe or not to use in animal feed .
it remains to be seen if this changes in the light of current events .
( applause )
madam president , i would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this house , because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later !
in certain circumstances , it is necessary to slaughter the entire stock of animals , which must come as a real blow .
the grass in our meadows , white clover and vetch - currently neglected by the cap - may provide satisfactory solutions for the safety of animal feed and human food .
selective aid , such as market support and a grass subsidy , are essential .
the scientific authorities clearly stated that the development of the disease in cattle was not under control and they pinpointed the alarming growth in the numbers of animals affected .
just now , i heard reference being made to random tests .
( applause from the uen group )
although a french action , it has widespread international implications .
the health of european consumers must be a top priority in all decisions that are adopted .
there is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals . why should it cover pigs , poultry and fish , as some member states and some members here have been demanding ?
madam president , i would advise the commission not to be so sure of itself or , more importantly , of its forecasts for the future .
yesterday , the coordinators of the various parties in the committee on agriculture and rural development lent their support to the proposal to earmark eur 600 million of the eur 1.3 billion still available in the agricultural budget for the fight against bse .
there is a general acknowledgement that bse , which began as a british disease and today is being presented as a french crisis , is really a european disease - a european problem - and it must be tackled on that basis .
we must take precautions now , not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned , but on behalf of the complacent minority of member states as well .
in the future , when these mbms are banned , we are going to need millions of additional hectares of oil seed crops .
i have worked out the cost - 10 cents per kilo .
this amounts to deliberately putting consumers at risk and , as such , is unacceptable .
parliament has voted half the budget to be spent on encouraging production .
what is more , this regulation is continually tightened up and complies with requirements made at european level .
however , we have learnt a great deal over the years as to how to put our house in order .
france has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many french provinces have stopped school children from consuming home-grown beef .
i believe that we must now try , following your debates , to define the key ways , in terms of both method and means , in order to ensure compliance with this imperative .
we are talking about public health , and hence of serious events , which must be treated as such , in a strict and , of course , transparent manner .
i believe that there has been compliance with the legislation and if i believe that - and i do not think i am being naã ¯ ve - i do not believe that it is essential to have a widespread ban on meat-and-bone meal to be fed to pigs and poultry .
mr martinez took part in the first one , and right here i have , if my fellow member would care to consult it , his minority opinion , which was expressed in writing at the time of the bã ¶ ge committee .
in the later , more long-term stage , the objective will be to define a fully comprehensive common asylum system .
on 12 december in palermo , the united nations is going to sign the world convention on organised crime with a protocol on the traffic in human beings .
the programme presented by the commission on the question of gender equality for the next five years contains five priorities , one of which concerns violence and human rights and we expect to work with governments , local authorities and non-governmental organisations here in order to put programmes in place in all the member states over the next five years .
as a result of the stability and growth plan , however , we have also launched the so-called stability programmes .
from an external viewpoint , it is true there is a problem - and indirectly i am answering mr nogueira - which is , we must not forget , that savings in europe are much greater than in the united states .
during the measurement campaign elevated levels of sulphur dioxide were observed in some hot-spots .
questions nos 25 to 28 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes questions to the commission .
following the mass unemployment of the 1980s , social exclusion risks becoming the new evil which will gnaw away at europe over the coming decade .
this will form the background against which we shall acquire a more common framework of understanding , for the concept of social exclusion is not so simple to define .
it would be useful to use some of the increased sum which is requested in this report to fund comparative studies to demonstrate how such developments might be managed .
i believe , however , that social exclusion and poverty are caused by social conditions and that responsibility is therefore shared .
if we are to achieve the economic and social cohesion to which we aspire we need not just a high level of employment , but also a high level of social protection .
the simple fact is that social exclusion is a brake on economic growth , while an inclusive society enhances growth and the well-being of everyone .
naturally , labour market policy is part and parcel of this issue .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent contribution to identifying the causes and the scale of poverty , which is an appropriate term for a social reality whose cruelty should not be watered down into a concept as wide-ranging and abstract as social exclusion .
the proposed action programme has a legal basis , article 137 of the treaty of amsterdam , and we had a new mandate after the lisbon council .
but i agree that `` poverty '' is politically a very strong word and i agree that we can add poverty to social exclusion where possible in the text of the proposal .
finally , i would like to respond to your concerns about the involvement of different actors and institutions in the implementation of this programme .
the proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the european union 's strategy to double the share of renewables in energy consumption by 2010 .
this makes it possible for member states to determine the exact level of their respective contributions to meeting the eu 's target , in accordance with the principles of burden sharing , and , in this area , also the sharing of opportunities .
this is a summit which intends to slow down climate change and at which the kyoto protocol will undergo its ordeal by fire .
renewable energy is by far the largest source of energy currently in use in the world .
as i see it though , these subsidies should be no more than reasonable and only payable for a limited period .
that is what politics is all about : making competition possible between the two instruments by protecting guaranteed prices and harmonising certificate-related issues .
hence my amendment to maintain the strict emission standards of annex 5 of the revised directive for waste incineration .
many of us feel that energy from waste should be included .
i think we not only need to develop renewable energy sources but a modern energy savings programme to run in parallel with that process , as this dependence is also starting to become a matter of security for us .
also , i would like to inform the commissioner that ireland can be competitive in wind energy in a very short time .
the debate on renewable energy sources must not become a form of populism against nuclear energy .
we need commitment from the government if we are to get the funding together .
renewable energy is no exception .
this is what we must do at a european level .
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs rothe on the magnificent work she has carried out , as well as all the members who have spoken and who have , on many occasions , tabled amendments to the text proposed to parliament and the council .
the commission rejects this part of amendment no 27 , amendments nos 11 , 54 , 55 , 61 and amendment no 57 , which are all related to it .
with regard to the principles on which the future harmonised support system must be based , the commission can accept the parts of amendments nos 37 and 38 which stipulate that such a system must take account of the environmental objectives of the treaty , the experience acquired with the support systems , which have proven to be effective and positive , as well as geographical conditions .
those widowed by conflicts are forced to bring up children and look after the elderly by themselves .
local participation in the peace and reconciliation processes is important .
preventative measures are needed , including the provision of special protection for women in refugee camps by segregating said camps .
finally , mr president , i wish to express my disappointment at what i see as shifty manoeuvres that have lead to the watering down of paragraph 12 concerning the rights and freedom of choice of women who fall victim to rape and states of war .
we really need to be practical .
we can not allow this state of affairs to continue , because the rights , priorities and interests of women are often ignored in peace negotiations and also because the few examples of women in decision-making positions in these areas have proved to be very effective .
i will mention several of my own priorities .
i am convinced that if women , both palestinian and israeli , had a say and a role in the peace process , there is every likelihood that a fair and viable solution to the palestinian question would have been found and we would not now be facing the present crisis , which is the outcome of 7 whole years of failed negotiation .
mr president , the report by mrs theorin includes many bizarre and curious elements , and i have to say we should avoid the notion that armies are some sort of social service and that their guiding motive should be political correctness .
mr president , please tell me who is representing the council at the moment , or the high representative for the cfsp .
to create antagonism between the sexes , as there is a determination to do in this chamber this evening , is neither peaceful nor constructive in my view .
mr president , what is clear is that we are witnessing an initial stage in which the gender dimension , the participation of women , is starting to become , if not the rule , then at least an element in various programmes .
so i think both sources of funding should be considered , with a view to carrying out a comprehensive study of the issue and to finding out what kind of initiatives people are trying to get off the ground in particular countries .
in some cases they are exploited and ill-treated .
i shall evaluate some of these arguments .
the second argument is that it would create a b team within the labour market .
in austria , and especially in my own region , an eu-assisted project involving a women 's advice centre acting as an agency for domestic helps has been very successfully running for three years .
now that the dark pages of the last ten years have been turned , your presence before this house bears witness to our common desire to see yugoslavia quickly rediscover its rightful place in the family of europe .
but now , in the wake of the decisive political turn of 24 september , or the even more decisive shift of 5 october , the major goal in yugoslavia 's foreign policy is to approach in a comprehensive manner a family of nations comprising the european union and then join it .
our most important task now is to begin to settle democratically internal relations in the federal republic of yugoslavia .
a democratic joint state makes it possible for muslims and albanians in montenegro and serbia to live in a single state , and enables us to join forces in building our equally joint state .
mr president , thank you very much for your address which , as you see , has had a great impact on the people assembled in this chamber .
mr president , on page 27 of the annex to the minutes my vote is recorded as having been cast in favour of amendment no 20 to the morillon report .
my aim throughout the report has been to produce a proposal which is politically mature , eminently reasonable and practical for both the institutions and the citizen .
another important amendment is the proposal to have not just the council , the commission and parliament fall within the scope of the regulation , but also all the external bodies .
it is also excellent that the institutions should be obliged , or they should be allowed , rather , to release documents also to those not resident in the european union , or who are not citizens of the european union .
the cashman report is , therefore , not just any old report .
unfortunately , the wish to anticipate any eventualities and to produce a regulation that is as complete and comprehensive as possible seems to have prevailed .
mr president , a lot of wise things have been said regarding the background to this report .
mr president , the cashman report can be summarised in four words : citizens ' power over bureaucracy .
this is something that parliament has supported and will probably also emphasise again today , which is important .
it is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the council and the commission .
according to reports , this regulation on public access has rarely been discussed in the college , and has been regarded by it up until now as a predominantly official matter .
it is citizens ' rights we are dealing with on this occasion .
at the same time , we members of the bonino list feel that we must not go too far and introduce extreme regulations allowing indiscriminate access to information or opinions which are of no decision-making import .
that provision could open the door wide to arbitrariness .
there is a difference between words and deeds .
it is a matter of legal security , an efficient administration and effective democracy .
that is certainly what we as a parliament should stick to .
in any case , we need a new age of enlightenment and this is a great opportunity for us meps to show our true colours .
in fact , it is important , as far as security is concerned , that the public can judge , using facts and documents , just how much confidence they have in european defence .
i would conclude that the council committed a serious error in july when it categorically declared all documents about military affairs secret .
the fundamental principle is therefore openness , but this must be reconciled with safeguarding the public interest and respect for certain rights which warrant special protection .
forcing institutions to publish these internal notes could , in many cases , simply lead to confusion amongst the citizens .
it is premature at this point in the legislative procedure to take a position on whether there should be a direct relationship between classification and access to documents , as proposed in amendment no 29 , or whether rules to this effect should be included in the present regulation .
mr cashman was right to say that it is not up to the commission to tell the political groups how they should vote here in plenary .
i would like to remind you of the pivotal role that the joint parliamentary committee eu-malta is playing in the ongoing negotiations towards the republic of malta ' s membership of the eu .
we are not allowing them to set their own capital charges but we would be getting suspiciously close to that if we did not keep a close eye on their internal systems .
( pt ) mr president , i wish to inform the house that the amendments that appear under the name of the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left , which i have tabled in my capacity as rapporteur , are the result of discussions with the council and the commission and also have the support of the coordinators of the political groups that are represented in the committee on employment and social affairs .
we are dealing with a very important piece of legislation and with important articles .
( applause from the ppe-de group )
mr president , unlike mrs theorin , i do not suggest moving votes and debates to suit my own personal agenda .
i am one of those members who attends sittings quite faithfully .
i voted against whole herd slaughter because i do not believe it is the best way to eradicate bse .
take measures at pan-european level ,
lesson number two : quality farming , which ensures a certain independence in regard to food , can not survive in europe in the context of a global free market .
the union as a whole must be involved , for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual .
the cap has always promoted intensive production , the gradual ` stepping up ' of production and land concentration , which has basically served the interests of the agro-food industry and the big transnational food companies .
this attitude is combined with lack of confidence in the european union , which appears to the citizens not to be able to guarantee the safety of the foodstuffs on the market .
let me point to the key role the uen group , and also the very coherent draft resolution we tabled , played in ensuring that it took place .
blokland report ( a5-0321 / 2000 )
parliament also succeeded with another point : plants in which radioactive waste is incinerated must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive .
i am absolutely convinced that 99 % of the responsibility for social exclusion and poverty lies with the governments of our 15 states .
unfortunately , however , good intentions do not make a policy , even one of condemnation .
too many of our fellow-citizens are left by the wayside .
since europe can not be economically strong without social justice , we can only welcome this progress .
a more effective way of combating exclusion would be , for example , to establish a european minimum guaranteed wage .
with a new , radical approach , i strongly believe that we can , not only turn the corner , but reach the finishing line too and , one day , banish poverty and social exclusion from the north-west entirely .
the cold winter days and nights of both northern and southern europe come to mind , where , sadly , many elderly people are forced by their low income to turn off the heating to save money .
- ( fr ) naturally i am in favour of actively promoting renewable energy sources .
i therefore thank mrs rothe for her good report .
this particularly applies to people who are not very well off and whose first concern , therefore , is that their household costs should remain as low as possible .
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
there is just one aspect that we are unhappy with , which is not a problem of substance , but concerns item 5 of this resolution : we feel that , by adopting this item , the european parliament has adopted an excessively paternalistic attitude .
we believe that , not only now but since parlacen was born , there are people who wish it to have fewer competences and less of a presence , because a parliament always creates discomfort , but i believe that the vocation of parlacen , and of this and other parliaments , is to be of benefit to the people it represents , even if this may make the established powers feel uncomfortable .
this is one of those questions on which we all feel practically the same , not only in this house but also amongst those many members who , as result of our own origins , view with great sympathy the processes of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries which we consider to be our own .
within our framework of cooperation with the area , we have paid special attention to all those institutions which support regional integration , the general secretariat of the central american integration system , the court of justice and especially parlacen , which is one of our priority objectives .
that is why we were so disturbed and sad to see the slow political , economic and human ruination of this country , orchestrated by the military junta of general gueã ¯ .
the west bears a patent and overwhelming responsibility for the current collapse of the ivoirian system .
the leaders have now been given a new chance and let us hope they seize it .
the european union must also make sure that none of its members establishes relations with its former colonies - and let me emphasise this - that are based solely on economic interests or geostrategic location .
when watara ' s supporters took to the streets in order to demand new elections their protest was put down using violent means .
the european union has been asked , and has declared itself prepared , to help ensure that the elections in december , as well as the local elections in january , are conducted in a peaceful , fair , free and transparent manner .
mr president , by means of various recent declarations , the european union has condemned the abuses of general gueã ¯ ' s regime ; it has also expressed its regret at the outright exclusion of the main opposition candidates from the election of 22 october , which has to a large extent limited the credibility of that very electoral process .
( b5-0861 / 2000 ) by vinci and others , on behalf of the gue/ngl group ;
mr president , in an answer to me on burma in the october session commissioner patten said that if things deteriorate in burma , then holding the eu-asean meeting planned for 11 and 12 december would be reconsidered .
as has been said , the truth is that the situation in burma is getting worse ; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as aung san suu kyi and that the democratic league can not operate normally in its work for the re-establishment of democracy , especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom , that lack of union rights there .
i know that it is of some small comfort that we continue to bang on the door of this evil and vicious regime and i hope very much that the suggestions that have been made by both mr deva and mrs kinnock will be recognised by the commission and respected .
vietnam
we work with vietnam ; it is our partner , and so we can not afford to keep our lips sealed about the situation there .
we adopted the resolution and we have had occasion to note that it brought about a few small improvements .
israel is probably one of the most obvious examples in world history of the fact that it is not so simple .
equally , consider how the special un rapporteur ' s recommendations regarding religious intolerance were ignored , and think of the lack of freedom of expression and the ongoing media censorship .
we in the commission fully share your concerns about this situation and we agree wholeheartedly with the numerous criticisms expressed here today of the way in which the military regime usually makes a mockery of each and every principle contained in the universal declaration of human rights .
i fully share the concern about the problems raised by some members : although it is true that almost 23 000 people have already been freed as a result of general amnesties , we must continue to show concern for those are still in prison for their political or religious beliefs .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m .
the eu has a wonderful opportunity to really take a lead in this change to an ecologically sustainable society where we will not have to deal with floods partly caused by our own inability to face up to the consequences of our own actions .
the commission must make all speed to use its energies and funds to ensure that those affected in the hardest hit areas are helped immediately , through such instruments as the erdf and the eaggf guarantee section .
and given the remarkable scale of the disaster , the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified , despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this house - on 26 october to be precise - and that a parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well .
as you know , we have a basic difficulty : the legal basis for taking action .
the next item is the vote on the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
mr president , i have concerned myself very closely with this question and have taken part in many discussions both in the committee on employment and social affairs and in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
i understand that this will meet with the approval of the other groups .
we believe that the aim should be to strengthen the public health system and the system of social protection and to safeguard its basic content , in the sense of a universal service , by supplying high-quality medical care and preventative care to every citizen , paying particular attention to those living in remote or island areas , within the framework of a single public-sector system of health and social insurance .
but let me specially emphasise the accuracy of the statement that all other health protection should be a matter for member states rather than the european union and that publicly funded healthcare systems should remain , as ever , within the exclusive competence of the member states .
the remainder of his proposals serve to dress the wounds that this option will cause .
at least , the majority of my group voted against ; and after all we did ensure that the report was not adopted during the last plenary part-session , but postponed until today .
so that means that if we manage to reach a decision at first reading , jointly with the council and the moderation of the commission , we will be happy to do so , but we will not give up our right to the codecision procedure from the outset .
but let us , after all , assume that the referee has not sold out to the other side and let us accept the idea that the texts by the commission and the rapporteur respond to a real and growing problem , as the report has it , and that the fact that these matters are being considered here at the same time the basel committee is considering them is a chance to settle them finally .
it is the small and medium-sized businesses that create most new jobs and protect existing ones .
it is therefore important not to dissociate ourselves from what is happening in basel , even though we obviously have our own legislative procedure .
a basic point for us in the process is the way in which we seek to maintain the present institutional balance .
i apologise to the house for being tempted at the end of the afternoon at the end of this part-session to take some of my longings for home as my inspiration for the debate on this report .
the public need to have the utmost confidence that the ombudsman is completely impartial in his investigations .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , almeida garrett , for her contribution in this important matter .
in relation to the ombudsman , a matter we have just been discussing , there were several complaints in the past about the lack of transparency in regard to recruitment , and that is a very crucial point , because we entirely agree with the ombudsman 's view that recruitment procedures are many young eu citizens ' first contact with the european institutions .
if there are inconsistencies it must be open to the candidate to draw attention to them .
we must not introduce more rigidity into provisions that may apply to institutions as different as the commission and the court of justice .
the committee says that the commission has informed the ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of july 2000 .
they are extremely clear , concise , pragmatic amendments which represent genuine reform , that is , the only reform worthy of the name which the european institutions ought to adopt on the recruitment procedure .
it is a hallmark of a confident democracy if the processes by which selection is made is done openly and without any recourse to confidentiality or secrecy .
for example , candidates are already allowed to take the examination questions away with them , the general evaluation criteria can be made known to those candidates who request them , the list of passes can be published in the official journal and the composition of the selection board may be published in the official journal ( in the case of general public entrance examinations ) or on the commission ' s web site ( in the case of internal or restricted examinations ) .
some months ago now , president prodi declared that this option would be available for all competitions as of july 2000 .
for the moment our business is to adopt the minutes .
( applause )
i therefore agree that there should be a higher weighting coefficient - 10 % for example - but it must be totally fixed in all cases and all circumstances .
i am of the view that , as a european parliament , we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a european police college under way .
we know that there are still a number of member states that support the creation of the college only as a permanent network of national institutes , but we feel that the majority will accept this proposal as a temporary stage that will make it possible to create a tangible institution within a maximum of three years .
the term ` police academy ' makes me think of a humorous american tv series about the police .
let us make sure that if we have a police college it is , as mr posselt 's report stresses , grounded in the need to develop and enhance respect for human and civil rights in our police culture .
as long as such matters have not been clarified , i have to say to you in all honesty that i myself can not consent to the basic idea .
i note that the rapporteur wants to change `` law enforcement officers '' to `` police '' , which is probably a good idea .
coming from a different part of the political spectrum , it is very interesting to hear him repeat , with the same hysteria , the same concerns .
you might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order .
i would prefer a small-scale , trained and organised police force , constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function .
the commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided .
it is especially important to stress that the european police college , which is expected to start its operations on 1 january 2001 , is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the member states of the european union ; it also involves the applicant countries of central and eastern europe .
according to what i have been told , this is the route that europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course .
there are constitutional concerns in some member states , notably germany and austria .
a europe without borders has most certainly contributed to an increase in the number of marriages between couples with different nationalities from both the e.u. and third countries .
unfortunately , others separate on the basis of accumulated hatred .
while it is true , however , that it is a great step forward from this point of view , i also share the opinion of mrs banotti and other honourable members that it is deplorable that the scope of this regulation should be limited to the protection of children of marriages that are recognised as such by the law .
could i ask for clarification on your point about article 17 .
with regard to the proposals submitted by the major federations for certain sports , which are in support of a protocol that would exempt them from complying with some of the treaty ' s basic rules , specifically those relating to free movement and to competition , it must be emphasised that this kind of exemption would , if we accept this definition of it , clearly be out of step with all of the objectives we are seeking to achieve .
the eu must not shrug its shoulders and say `` tant pis '' if banning the transfer system does irreparable harm to football .
i wish , before the commission is granted new powers in this area , it would use those it already has .
provided that the details of its implementation respect the relevant rules , such a measure seems to be in line with current community law which aims at the elimination of distortion of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and at harmonisation of levy systems within the european union .
it may be advantageous at this moment just to say what has actually been proposed by the uk government and also what they are proposing , bearing in mind the crisis in britain and indeed throughout the whole of the european union with regard to the road haulage industry .
when an important proposal of this kind comes forward we , in this house , should have the chance to think about it and discuss it as early as possible , not necessarily for the last time .
precautionary measures are therefore required in this area .
on the first point you made , mr miller , this proposal was put to the house by the president and it was the house which agreed to the change to today 's agenda .
i agree that irish trucks have a special case .
i should like to express my deepest sympathy to his family and friends and to all those in spain who believe in the strength of democracy .
this has been noted , mr dell ' alba .
in order not to let the mandate of the buenos aires plan of action , that ran until the so-called cop6 conference , expire without any concrete result or follow-up , parties have decided to suspend cop6 and resume the conference in may 2001 .
in addition to further coordination within the european union , contacts with other parties should be intensified .
this was felt by many countries , particularly the green groups , to be a huge loophole .
the fact that after mr prescott ' s rather noisy departure , the americans tabled new proposals , which came closer to the eu position , demonstrates that the french presidency was right to hold firm .
if the clean development mechanism starts working then they will receive between usd 5 billion and usd 25 billion in addition , annually .
china will then have to stabilise its emissions , and then india will be allowed to double its emissions .
the united states produce the largest amount of pollution per capita .
the environment committee of this parliament has been at the forefront in addressing the issue of climate change in the past .
i should not , however , like to enter into personal squabbles , and i think we should refrain from that sort of completely negative discussion .
kyoto must not remain an empty promise .
secondly , i think that the section of commerce and industry which looks seriously at this problem and which would like to have some ground rules has also lost out .
to put it frankly , if we have to make an assessment of what took place , we could say that out of the three parties participating in the conference , only one tried to reach an agreement and tried to achieve a global policy on climate change , and that was the european union .
of course we need some clear operational rules to regulate an emissions trading market worth twelve billion dollars .
all ministers know that they can not escape this huge task of combating climate change ; this was also clear from the meeting in the hague .
the president of the republic himself is coming here on 12 december to present a report on the presidency .
the fifteen are now close to agreement on making enhanced cooperation more flexible .
on the other hand , the idea of a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in article 6 , championed by the european parliament in its recommendation of 14 november , and placed on the table at the igc by the french presidency , was vigorously rejected by several member states .
we will therefore have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the cologne european council and the european union will have at its disposal a very strong benchmark , clearly setting out the rights and values in which it believes .
finally , the nice european council will reflect the priority the french presidency accords to economic and social issues and all the issues where the european union can really respond to the concerns of europeans .
moreover , on the basis of the feira conclusions for the implementation of a commission action plan `` e-europe 2002 - an information society for all '' , the council has worked on progress indicators .
there are several aspects to this debate , and i will touch briefly on three of them : firstly , the need to close the intergovernmental conference by adopting a treaty that has genuine added value ; secondly , our security policy on crisis management ; and finally , the need to mark out the way beyond nice .
much remains to be done if we are to find a suitable solution .
so we do need a reweighting of voting rights with a view to ensuring that a majority of states which are home to a minority of the european population can not ultimately make the rules ; the unequivocal democratic principle must certainly prevail here .
i agree totally with the sentiment of president prodi that this is an historic opportunity and one that should not be lost .
my group , at this stage , would prefer a reweighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that other issues are under review .
our group strongly supports constitutionalising the european union treaties , and this also means that the reform of the treaties should be open , with civil society being able to participate in this process .
if democracy is to be strengthened , this naturally implies that majority voting must be accompanied by a right of codecision for the european parliament .
let us not start again tomorrow with a new multilateral agreement on investment or new talks on agriculture post seattle .
home affairs and legal policy are to be subject to majority voting as from 2004 .
mr president , the very title of this item on our agenda indicates the importance of article 133 in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting .
it is extremely sad that a situation has developed where large and small countries have come to take opposite sides .
if we want to actually overcome the deadlock on qualified majority in order to enable the european union to accommodate new members , then everyone has to make some small concession .
parliament has also proved itself a serious partner within the drafting of the charter , and it would be especially refreshing should british prime minister blair publicly recognise that fact .
a decision in nice to the effect that , for example , the applicant states must have the opportunity to participate in the next elections to the european parliament could help put the necessary pressure on the eu itself , so that enlargement can become a reality .
i would gladly give up these 40 extensions if we could achieve majority voting in five areas where substantive progress can be made , such as trade , social policy , justice and home affairs , structural policy and taxation , to name the most important .
it is now the eve of its conclusion and we are aware of the progress which has been made , the partial results which have been achieved , but frankly , over almost ten months of a major intergovernmental conference , there has been no rapprochement of the positions , mr vã © drine , and no definition of agreements , not to mention the fact that some of the topics indicated by parliament in its resolution of 13 april , ranging from the regulation of the economy to the institutional implications of the common defence policy , have not even been debated .
the governments have lost sight of the urgent need for reforms because they are concentrating too much on their own position of power in the new set-up .
mr president i would like to remind the council and commission , and indeed the house , of a resolution that we carried on 26 october in relation to better law-making .
i believe that all the speakers are very concerned about the results of the nice european council .
finally , not only has the charter of fundamental rights not yet been incorporated into the text of the treaty ; it has barely even been agreed to mention it in article 6 .
while not in any way detracting from the aspirations , and indeed the entitlement , of some of those countries to join the community by 2002 , it would not , i believe , be in their best interests , or indeed the interests of member states , to achieve this deadline without first ensuring an orderly transition with minimum disruption to the economies of existing member states .
everyone will have to sacrifice some of their cherished exceptions if we are to reach a result in nice .
we know that a definitive solution must be in place for the parliament to be elected in 2009 , which will , after all , last until 2014 .
i take the view that nice must at least accept the compromise called for by the european parliament , i.e. for the charter to be combined with article 6 , paragraph 2 .
our public in the eu and the public in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of nice leftovers , of a second igc in 2004 .
should we falter , this will provoke parliament ' s condemnation .
although we now see the french presidency , mr president of the council , playing a decisive part here , it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today , just a few days before the igc ministerial meeting .
besides , the overall result of the coming igc ministerial meeting , another small but unfortunately far from delicate detail is causing me some concern .
despite that , although this exercise is also very useful because it raises many relevant questions and suggestions , i have to say that i found the overall tone excessively negative .
we are doing our best , if i may say so .
they accept it in principle , they accept it for the long term , but they have legitimate democratic interests to defend , and in their view the right conditions are not yet in place .
this is why it is so important that the community method is consolidated at nice , together with the value of the european institutions - the council , parliament and the commission - and their ways of working together .
this was an abuse of this parliament 's proceedings , a gross discourtesy to a distinguished guest and an event that could have had very serious consequences .
i shall give the president the name of the member in question and ask her to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing such disruptive and aggressive individuals from entering the house . the shocking thing is that this incident took place with the aid of a member of this house .
virtually the same day , a leader from the cypriot parliament , who has , moreover , already visited the european parliament , mr christou , was refused a turkish visa even though he was travelling , if you can believe it , to a tripartite meeting in istanbul between turks , greeks and cypriots , in a totally peaceable context .
this is evidence of the way verbal violence leads to physical violence .
in 1966 , ernest lluch , his brother and myself , with more than 60 other members of the teaching staff were expelled by the francoist regime from the university of barcelona .
mr gorostiaga , you are a disgrace to this parliament .
( a5-0339 / 2000 ) by mrs lalumiã ¨ re , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the establishment of a common european security and defence policy after cologne and helsinki ( 2000/2005 ( ini ) ) ;
mobilisation orders are also a national responsibility , because each country takes a sovereign decision as to whether or not it will participate in a joint operation .
first , a brief comment on a crucial issue : the relationship between the new european policy and nato .
similarly the status of the high representative must be clarified in relation to the existing triangle and the commissioner responsible for external relations .
the next issue is ongoing arrangements with third countries and nato .
three common strategies have been adopted since may 1999 , on russia , on ukraine and on the mediterranean region .
an eu-ukraine summit also took place , on 15 september , and the fruitful political dialogue that resulted is now being extended to issues of conventional arms exports , security and disarmament , a subject highlighted by the osce as being a problem where ukraine is concerned .
i would not want to conclude this summary without mentioning the union ' s action on what are today known as the great global or cross-sectoral dossiers , particularly in the field of human rights , where work is still necessary to improve the coherence of european policy in international bodies and to involve civil society more closely .
i am delighted to continue in this vein by talking to you today about the results of our conference on military commitments of 20 november .
these contributions therefore enable us , in terms of quantity , to fully meet the overall target set by the council .
by 2003 , when the bodies that have been established are in a position to fulfil their duties , the european union will gradually become capable of accomplishing some of the petersberg tasks .
we all know that the genesis of the european union , the main objective of the founding fathers was to prevent europe tearing itself apart in yet another civil war .
there is need for further reinforcement of coherence and effectiveness in the external activities of the european union cutting across the pillars .
again , i refer to the sometimes not entirely balanced and objective media in my own country , who seem to have some difficulty in comprehending that distinction .
the talokan offensive cut off the only route of supply to the panchir valley and the shomali plains , where commander massood 's forces are concentrated , as also a large proportion of the uprooted people and refugees .
the rapid reaction force is intended to implement the petersberg tasks .
it therefore seems a little unnecessary to regulate in great detail how , for example , european forces in space are to be organised .
the same ideas about the greatest possible transparency were expressed in mr cashman ' s report which we adopted with a broad majority two weeks ago in strasbourg .
i would like to hear what mr richard has to say to this and ask him what he thinks parliament ' s role ought to be if there is no such secret protocol .
that has to stop .
nevertheless , the ` republic of fear ' , as saddam ' s reign of terror was appropriately dubbed many years ago , is still greatly underestimated by many western politicians , also within the european parliament .
i would like to highlight very clearly the progress made by the french presidency in the field of common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence policy , and i wish to say this particularly because , in the previous debate on the european council in nice , certain reservations were expressed on the progress made in general during this presidency .
i realise , minister , that you are sceptical and that you have just said ` no ' again , as you did in paris on a previous occasion , but this parliament still believes in these principles , irrespective of party allegiance , and we shall go on campaigning for their acceptance .
concentration on purely reactive crisis management has thrown the common foreign and security policy totally out of synch .
this means that curbing arms exports to unstable regions must be the first aim for the council to pursue , that trade policies must be fair , that assistance must be given to encourage the sustainable development of countries in volatile regions and , above all , that the democratic forces in civil society must be supported .
we also warmly applaud the efforts undertaken by mr patten - whom we hold in very high esteem , as we do mr solana - because something is being done at last .
i have to say that there is much in the brok report that we can support , in particular the importance attached to enlargement of the european union .
thirdly , while i welcome the rapid reaction force , we have to be clear from europe 's perspective , as we only get one chance to get this right .
mr president , today we are debating two politically important reports , both of which basically concern the cfsp .
we will never be philosophically neutral nor should that ever be confused with military neutrality .
however , i wonder whether it would not have been possible to be harder and harsher in our criticism and even threaten to impose sanctions on the country which gives the regime the greatest support , support without which the taliban regime would crumble , namely pakistan .
mr president , paragraph 31 of mr brok ' s report on the common foreign and security policy highlights the following message : ' [ the european parliament ] stresses the need , for the democratic legitimacy of russia , given its political union with belarus , that russia 's president and government unequivocally reiterate the strong need for democratic reforms in belarus , particularly in the light of the report delivered in minsk on 16 october 2000 by the parliamentary troika from the european union , the council of europe and the osce . '
on the question of the concept : this concept was adopted in 1992 .
there will still be other forms of rapprochement to invent with the national parliaments , but at any rate one thing that is within our reach and that represents a turning point i believe we can all welcome , is the fact that the fifteen nations which make up this union , which have already built a political reality that has a positive effect on the international balance of power , these fifteen nations have chosen to acquire the means to act jointly in cases where violence challenges our values .
following the reports by the independent experts , the commission , at the initiative of mr kinnock , presented a white paper proposing reforms to the way it functions .
the leitmotif is the systematic reminder that , parallel to any legislative procedure , all budgetary decisions must be taken in the framework of the related annual procedures and the interinstitutional agreement .
our committee was very pleased to see the conclusions of the bourlanges report on externalisation taken up in the letter of amendment .
it will be followed by many other reports and , for my part , after these weeks of working together , i hope we adhere to this method in future too .
this is the basis of the new philosophy for management of the commission : each administrative unit will be expected to take responsibility for the regularity and legality of all its actions .
mr president , it is a special pleasure for me finally , and i emphasis the word finally , to be here tonight presenting this report .
that is the core of what we are trying to do here .
is the commission able today to carry out the tasks and , in addition , the political role which fall to it under the treaties ?
we will continue it in spring on the basis of the nice conclusions and the new commission proposals .
nevertheless , we will give the commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal .
the reform process is on track and being implemented as the commission ' s progress reports have shown .
the same practice needs to be followed in the payment of eu bills as in the outside world .
indeed , we believe that the establishment of new posts has been very tentative ; given the current tasks of the commission and the forthcoming eastward enlargement , there will certainly be a need to increase the rate of staff recruitment in future .
the new rules must therefore be tested as to their feasibility .
the entire structure of the commission , which is a fundamental institutional body of the union 's current system , implements european union policy as willed by parliament and the council .
we are opposing the rest of the amendments as they either add nothing to the report or basically take us off into flights of fantasy .
consequently , our group supports the commission ' s proposals - the white paper - promoted by commissioner kinnock .
delays in payment are mounting up and the bureaucratic obstacles are well known .
we have all seen how the culture of fear has rather paralysed - totally paralysed i might say - the decision-making processes within the commission , and by that i also mean the departments and the officials .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am going to be very brief , but first i would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs .
it is also appropriate for me to provide an up-to-date picture of the latest progress with the implementation of our strategy for applying modernising changes and for preparing the further improvements , which we outlined in our strategy eight months ago .
with more time , naturally , i would be very happy to address the matters raised , and i am sure that there will be other opportunities .
some building blocks are being chiselled out , while others still have to be approved in formal decisions of parliament and the council prior to implementation .
it must become a matter of course for the commission to pay invoices within the prescribed time limit , and this is the target the commission has set itself .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m .
we will see this next year when we are presented with the assessment we are asking for of the results of the reform .
thirty years ago , it provided 7 % of international aid ; today the figure is 17 % .
we want clearer objectives .
the commission must also ensure that this happens at international level .
this report told us how , in fact , poverty and under-development continue to gain ground and that a huge number of people are still unable to exercise their inalienable right to live in dignity .
the process of implementing the commission ' s decision of may on reform of external relations is going well .
it is also necessary to make sure that programmes can in future be easily managed by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners .
report ( a5-0342 / 2000 ) by mr ortuondo larrea , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council amending council directive 94/57/ec on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations [ com ( 2000 ) 142 - c5-0175 / 2000-2000/0066 ( cod ) ]
the fact is that , on the basis of proposals we made last february , the european commission put forward its own proposals with the greatest alacrity .
all lie at the very heart of the regulations of shipping as a whole and i want to remind you that , in addition to the three proposals which are to be discussed here today , the ` erika ii ' package , as mr gayssot has already mentioned , will be put on the table next week .
since then , sadly , there have been many other disasters at sea , we know only too well .
thirdly , we support , and there is a great amount of support , that a dangerous ship should not simply be detained and then allowed to return to sea .
i may add that the commission 's initiative in presenting this position was an important initiative because it acted like a sword of damocles , effectively pressuring the ã  ã  ã  into getting a move on .
on the other hand , it requires that inspections only be carried out by specialist , exclusive inspectors , that they may not have a relationship with or be dependent on the shipowner in any way , and that the shipowner may not control the vessel classification society .
furthermore , although the direct dumping of industrial materials , including military dumps of redundant munitions , is largely a practice which has been abandoned by member states , the sights of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases a threat to human safety .
the cooperation includes exchange of information and mapping of munitions dump sites .
vigorous action must be taken on the question of flags of convenience , including that of the kerguelen islands in the case of france , and against ships which fly the flag of states with above average detentions and delays during the 36 months preceding the adoption of these directives , which are blacklisted in the annual report of the paris memorandum of understanding .
the choice is yours .
my first request to you is that the council sign , seal and deliver this very quickly .
if a flag state defaults , then the port state must be given increased responsibility .
eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub-standard in terms of safety , and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances .
many players have stressed that the lack of maritime safety is largely due to deregulation and lenient practices .
how , with the european union under a french presidency , will we be able to explain to the people of france that the european parliament has abolished the necessary incentive and financial deterrence measures proposed in order to expedite the phasing in of double-hull oil tankers ?
speaking of the responsibilities of the port state , we must take care not to underplay the importance of the tasks to be fulfilled by the port authorities .
as we understand that it is the minimum text that the council will accept , we are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading , but we will not vote against it because we recognise the excellent work done by the rapporteur , mr ortuondo , which resulted in some agreed amendments which show us the path to take for the next reading .
all eyes were on the erika in the first instance , but a tanker was sinking in other waters off turkey at the same time .
i have a few brief comments to make regarding single-hull ships .
we have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected .
we must have a full picture of all parties ' responsibilities and hence of their liability .
that also goes for the matter of double-hull design requirements .
then perhaps we could have avoided a catastrophe .
i think we can strike the required balance on the basis of the commission and imo proposals and the reports under discussion , on which the rapporteurs really do deserve to be congratulated .
this is demonstrated by the fact that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have certainly had some success .
classification society performance must be assessed by common criteria : number of accidents , incidents or detentions of inspected and certified ships that cause pollution .
when the ievoli sun sank , it was relatively young , it had a double hull , a crew from the european community and it was flying the italian flag .
but the most important thing is the unshakeable will which must motivate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to establish maritime safety .
most of the amendments are focused on the proposed refusal of access to community waters .
many are either outside the scope of the port state control or are already covered by this or another directive .
for similar reasons , the commission can not accept the new amendment no 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation .
i share parliament ' s concern that there should be no undue influence from a shipowner over a classification society .
secondly , in our proposal on ` erika ii ' concerning surveillance of navigation , member states will be required to intervene even on the high seas in such cases .
mr poos , would you like to add something to the debate ?
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
we are withdrawing the resolution since its content has been reproduced almost in full and to the letter in the joint resolution signed by the chairmen of the main political groups .
the first part is an oral amendment , but the second part is a motion for a split vote , which i can not accept , because it has not been tabled in time .
report ( a5-0328 / 2000 ) by mr lamassoure , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the white paper on reforming the commission ( aspects concerning the committee on constitutional affairs ) [ com ( 2000 ) 200 - c5-0448 / 2000 - 2000/2218 ( cos ) ]
watts report ( a5-0343 / 2000 )
merchant ships need to be inspected by government departments with suitably trained staff and proper technological facilities , with the active involvement of the shipping trade union movement .
. ( fr ) i voted in favour of the watts report , which aims to enhance the quality and frequency of inspections in the ports of the member states of the european union .
if we had thought of it before , if mr hatzidakis had been here before , in previous years , he would surely have proposed the double-hull design and we would have avoided so many disasters .
the risk of ships crashing into each other is so great there that without extra supervision and inspections , shipping accidents are becoming increasingly likely .
we must stick with the commission proposal .
in the case of the erika , the local fishing and aquaculture industries suffered a bitter blow and it is important not just to look at the harmful effects that are apparent in the immediate aftermath , but also to look ahead at the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution .
the commission and the council must now follow up the request for environmental impact assessments ( eias ) and put it to the russian authorities that all future oil trade with russia will be conditional upon an eia .
what is more , the training of the inspectors of these societies differs from country to country .
but the best result of all would be if harmonised inspections were to become the direct responsibility of the government .
we reject the general extension of qualified majority voting accompanied by the simultaneous extension of codecision and the abolition of the luxembourg compromise .
within foreign and security policy we take a positive view of the fact that crisis management has been given a prominent position .
as we have also made known through the individual votes , we have , throughout the intergovernmental conference , been opposed to the much expanded agenda which , by means of repeated motions for resolutions , the majority in the european parliament has been trying to draw up .
the importance of the social agenda must also be highlighted so that it can be implemented speedily .
as far as the general extension of qualified majority voting is concerned , i do not believe that this is a helpful proposal as it would pre-empt the right of member states to take a decision at the appropriate time on whether a policy should be communitised .
all the advocates of a liberal europe are enlarging is the scale of misery of peoples already crushed by poverty and not only that but , on this occasion , they are imposing a political agenda which involves placing on an official footing a core of rich countries which will control an expanded european market .
. ( pt ) parliament has just voted for a resolution on the nice summit in which :
our debates within this chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges .
i am against the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a council of defence ministers .
we feel that the conversion of the commission ' s delegations into community delegations risks leading to conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations of the member states .
hence , it is clear that the way to strengthen the weight of european diplomatic action is to seek the harmonisation - where desirable , opportune and effective - of decisions which remain fundamentally the prerogative of the national actor , not through structural constraints which are totally ineffectual .
- ( da ) the liberals ' five members of the european parliament have today voted in favour of mrs lalumiã ¨ re ' s report on the common security and defence policy , because we are in favour of strengthening the eu countries ' power to act and , therefore , nato too .
we protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this chamber , with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups , from the extreme right to the greens and the socialists .
in paragraph 49 , member states who do not wish to or can not participate in a task are nonetheless obliged to make a contribution to the financing of the task .
the rapporteur now cites a number of reasons for taking action outside one ' s own territory , one being justifiable outrage at ethnic conflicts outside the union .
furthermore , there are many paragraphs to which we have specific objections , e.g. :
a break of that kind with nato , only to see a new partitioning of europe , is far from the enigmatic words spoken following the fall of the berlin wall .
let me pre-empt any misinterpretation of my vote as an expression of opposition to women 's participation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
. ( fr ) the only positive aspects of this report are that it calls for a ` european definition of domestic work ' and a ` clear limitation of the maximum number of hours to be worked ' .
that , of course , almost sounds like a perfect world when i read all the proposals for possible exceptional arrangements that are listed in this report .
income taxes , social security contributions and vat drive up the hourly rate to levels that almost no household with a normal income is prepared to pay .
- ( nl ) female labour has a long history of poor pay , poor working conditions , a poor legal position and sexual intimidation .
this resignation , the outcome of a long process of deterioration , must not however make us forget that the ` delors commission ' bore heavier responsibilities than its successor .
but most of all i voted in favour because what i would like - and i want to say this in this parliament - is that when the accounts are checked , that is , how the money has been spent by the commission , attention should be paid not only to checking the figures - 4 plus 4 is 8 , 8 plus 8 is 16 , 16 plus 16 is 32 , 32 plus 32 is 64 - but also to checking whether these expenses have really been useful to europe , whether they have really achieved the aims that they were meant to achieve .
by the same token , lack of transparency and nepotism must be eradicated from recruitment , especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts .
. british conservative members will vote against the report because of the well-rehearsed opposition to the extension of qmv and proposed incorporation of the blanket of fundamental rights into the treaty .
adjournment of the session
that is what i was told , but i shall seek more up-to-date information and i shall pass on your message .
that is our group 's position .
madam president , nice has been a particularly important summit .
with regard to the assessments in question , i will give just one example .
we believe that this report needs further consideration , which is why we would ask to be able to discuss it and vote on it in january .
it is very important that he is present for this report because he is very interested in it and we are very much in the hands of the commission for its success .
we have a rule in this parliament that smoking is prohibited in certain places - that includes the chamber .
adjustments had to be made to the draft directive and some have been proposed this time round as well .
if not , i have also spoken on her behalf .
if this proves not to be the case , at least the responsibilities will be clear and easily identifiable .
but ladies and gentlemen , if you truly acknowledged the health problems linked to tobacco , you would demand a ban on this drug , just as you continue to maintain the bans on other substances despite the fact that , quantitatively , they are far less lethal .
amendment no 2 concerning carbon monoxide is , therefore , particularly positive .
history teaches us that it is dangerous to regard the goal - however noble and virtuous - as superior to the agreed rules .
mr president , i rise in defence of the workers in the industry .
although i was not present , my vote , of course , supported the committee .
therefore , i am not concerned so much at the moment with health issues , which are , of course , important and considerable , as with the constraints that would result from our accepting such a restrictive interpretation of the legislative powers which this european parliament would have .
mr president , if this proposal actually becomes law at second reading , this will lead to companies ' freedom being curtailed somewhat , and to a slight improvement in the protection of public health .
the results of the research on that matter are so clear that it would be wrong for us , as european union legislators , not to follow such advice .
following the european court of justice ruling the committee then adopted the opinion again , admittedly this time by a large majority .
this is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way .
the power of big tobacco companies is all too evident .
to the shame of this european union , we require our taxpayers to subsidise the growing of the wretched stuff to the tune of over eur 1 billion a year .
the testing procedure is inefficient .
this directive was introduced to take account of the european parliament 's valverde lã ³ pez report of 1997 which mentioned many of the elements of the present text and called for a proposal from the commission .
therefore , the need to regulate in the interests of consumers is clear .
in this respect , let me point out that , from the point of view of international and community rules , there is no exception for registered trade marks in measures taken for public-health protection , particularly here , where the effects on smokers ' behaviour are so dramatic .
this is linked to the question of access to products , in particular where machines are situated in unsupervised areas .
summer time
there are other issues we would still like to look at , issues like energy consumption and health and safety , as they relate to summer time ; but the strongest argument is undoubtedly that we want to allow new member states the opportunity to come into line with the arrangements .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again i see that a far-reaching debate is raging about the pros and cons of summer time .
the proposal that has now been made is , in the opinion of our group , a good one , and our group supports it , and no more amendments to it are needed .
it also causes problems for agriculture when during autumn threshing the morning dew ought to have disappeared according to the time by the clock , but , wonder of wonders , nature has not been following the directive .
as regards the amendments tabled , the commission can agree to amendments nos 3 and 4 since they aim at making the system more transparent and emphasise the precautionary principle .
the compromises which we have agreed greatly improve the common position from the european parliament 's point of view .
children are given medicines which have only been tested on adults , which means that children are badly treated .
it may contribute to improving clinical research in europe and hence the welfare of millions of sick people .
this compromise , which of course can be further improved upon by each member state , constitutes a minimum standard , to ensure that we do not have a kind of ethical dumping in the european union and to avoid a situation where it is possible to carry out research on those unable to give informed consent in one member state and not in others .
finally , and here i am dissatisfied with the council 's compromise proposals , i think that the main investigator during clinical trails should be a doctor , because only a doctor has the knowledge and experience needed in order to evaluate the benefits and deal with any side effects or risks which arise during the clinical trial .
the next item is the report ( a5-0377 / 2000 ) by mr trakatellis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , concerning the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council extending certain programmes of community action in the field of public health adopted by decisions 645/96/ec , 646/96/ec , 647/96/ec , 102/97/ec , 1400/97/ec and 1296/1999/ec and amending those decisions [ com ( 2000 ) 0448 - c5-0400 / 2000 - 2000/0192 ( cod ) ] .
i would even go so far as to say that we may well have inaugurated a new modus operandi for codecision issues .
it is precisely on this issue that we believe there is a notable lack of direction in the european union , in the council and the commission , which , with the budgetary cuts - not wanting to reach the ceiling of 1.27 % which the regulations in force currently allow - is harming actions such as these at a time when coordination between the different member states is becoming increasingly important .
this is an area that can be looked at in the context of the new community health programme which is due to come on stream .
the text being agreed today on the extension of six public health programmes reflects what has been informally agreed between the institutions .
all of these factors , acting separately , but multiplying their effects when acting together , have meant that every day millions of people quite simply cross the borders of their state of residence into another state of the european union , whether to live , to work or just to travel .
the european union can not accept the idea that people might receive different treatment depending on the state in which they have been a victim of crime or on their nationality .
that is why we should perhaps consider once again whether it is right for us to vote in favour of this initiative .
indeed , we can not talk seriously about a citizens ' europe unless we take account of victims ' rights .
the liberal group feels that a very good report has emerged from the debate in committee and we will be supporting the committee amendments when we vote .
compensation for the victim must take precedence over the payment of the fine and legal costs to the state .
i welcome the proposal from portugal for strengthening the standing of victims of crime in criminal procedure also , even though i have every respect for the views relating to legal aspects expressed by mr lehne earlier .
who will then go out and vote if their problems are completely disregarded ?
several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , foreseeing the right of victims to communicate in one of these languages .
as i have just said , in order to go further within the framework of following up its communication of 14 july 1999 , the commission works on the adoption of concrete measures to support victims , in particular through the support envisaged for the european forum for victim services .
we will take note of it .
i think that the institutions , in this case the commission , should work more responsibly to ensure that proposals reach this house in due time so that a rapporteur can be appointed , the commission proposal can be examined , amendments can be tabled , they can be debated in committee and they can then come to the plenary , which they have asked us to do in a single plenary sitting , which is impossible .
we have not set budgetary objectives in advance and then tried to tailor our policy to them .
what worried us most right through the budget procedure was how to fund our foreign policy .
i hope that the person who succeeds me as parliament 's general rapporteur and the belgian presidency of the council , which will be taking over in the second half of next year , enjoy their discussions .
let me be quite clear here : we have a number of vacant positions here in parliament , which save us several tens of millions of euros from one year to the next .
perhaps another reason why we should discuss this on our knees is the attitude of some members of this house , as all they seem to want to do is blindly obey the instructions of the council .
the first point of agreement between the council and parliament concerns external action , that is , heading 4 of the budget , on which our institutions shared a common goal , which was to release substantial funding for the balkans region in 2001 , given recent developments in serbia ' s political situation , and to do so without passing the costs of this on to the other geographical priorities of the union ' s external action .
lastly , agreement was reached on 23 november on an increase in payment appropriations for the 2001 budget , which is an increase of 3.5 % over the 2000 budget .
by the same token , within this interinstitutional agreement , the council has left substantial margins within the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , largely for heading 3 - internal policy - and for heading 4 - external action .
you must now give this outcome your approval .
the court of auditors recently confirmed in a special report that this objective is being achieved and that the money from the cohesion fund is being put to good use .
with regard to the specific cases that we have experienced for the last two years , in other words , kosovo and serbia , mobilising the flexibility instrument has enabled us to fund exceptional expenditure through an exceptional effort .
if you consider that american companies receive the equivalent of three times as much aid and a capricious country such as turkey spends in excess of 10 % of government money on agriculture and horticulture , then it is europe that wants something for nothing .
output instead of input .
commissioner , fish is an essential element for a healthy , balanced diet that is rich in proteins .
we believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the european union institutions operate .
it is important for the people in the balkans to understand , following the long period of hostilities during which our side presented a united front , that they can also rely on us when it comes to reconstruction .
you are undermining the interinstitutional agreement and let me assure you that we shall consider whether or not we intend to have a part in this next year .
constant use of the flexibility reserve is undermining the transparency of the budget and in time this too will lead to a loss of credibility .
today i join you , the representatives of the european peoples , to tell you the results of the intergovernmental conference on institutional reform .
i know that parliament considered the number of areas in which qualified majority voting will apply to be one of the priorities of these negotiations .
i would also highlight the fact that this igc resulted in an extension of the powers and competences of the european parliament .
in the last six months , europe has also made progress in the field of growth and employment .
two months ago , our education ministers adopted an action plan for mobility - a forty-two point action plan - and we agreed on a substantial allocation of eur 400 million for the media-plus programme , which is so important for european cinema and audiovisual services and which - as you will be aware - the whole profession was hoping for .
the swedish presidency , one of whose priorities , i would remind you , is the environment , now has the task of concluding the second batch of proposals , which includes in particular , the creation of a european maritime safety agency .
the union intends to use this military wing in complete harmony with nato facilities and , if necessary , with their support .
france has been particularly aware of this .
moreover , in your own address at the beginning of the summit , you said that parliament would judge the success of nice in terms of quality as well as quantity .
to respond to our citizens ' demands , we had advocated a double majority as the only solution which is objective , comprehensible and widely supported by smaller and larger countries alike .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the european council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , finally the summit concluded with a result .
at the same time , the declaration on enlargement - which is a positive one - says that the applicant countries will be able to join the union at the end of 2002 , and the heads of government of the countries that are in negotiations have welcomed nice .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , i should like to give you a little history lesson , concerning a famous french doctor , whose name was couã © and who invented a method - the couã © method - based on the principle of autosuggestion and self-hypnosis .
besides , what a cruel illustration of the crisis which is not only institutional , but which , at a deeper level , is an identity crisis for european integration in the face of the titanic issues confronting the european union !
the technique is now tried and tested : always put off for another time the burden of proof ; take decisions that are void of content or which will not be implemented for a long time and finally present the whole business as a magnificent success .
it upsets almost everyone , beginning with those known as the smaller countries .
taking into account these interests and differences within the council would have avoided the debates on the number of commissioners to which each state is clinging .
thank you , mr hager .
and he adds that we have decided on a handful of targets which the member states are free to apply if they want to . so that should not worry you ...
before the vote on amendment no 22 :
so use in paediatric medicine sometimes falls under the heading of empirical individual prescriptions , and we need to promote the development at pharmaceutical laboratories of specific products prepared for children and their pathologies so that the doses and forms of the medicines are suited to their bodies .
summer time has , in practice , become normal time .
but when i got back to italy , mr fatuzzo , '' continued carlo fatuzzo the tourist , `` in order to obtain another identity card and another driving licence , i had to report the incident again , this time to the italian police .
madam president , i wholeheartedly support this report on better protection for victims of crime which demonstrates yet again in the eu 's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens .
i am told he is due to be deported to russia .
heartbreaking results for parliament : the refusal to see majority decisions seriously extended ; the exclusion of parliament from codecision and - i say this in passing - the shocking fact that the composition was fixed without parliament even being consulted on that composition .
for the decisions on council voting and seats in parliament a more suitable venue would have been the casino at cannes rather than the acropolis at nice , with mr chirac playing the role of chief croupier .
for the swedish negotiators , it would appear to have been more important to please the large member states than to fight for our own influence .
the treaty of nice contains a series of quite decisive steps towards an eu of ã © lites , together with corresponding steps away from a europe of democracies and of the people .
our method must be a method which allows us to set up an intergovernmental conference through a convention at which parliamentarians , not chancelleries have their say if we are to take this continent forward .
mr prodi , commissioner barnier , this is our task .
as for the european parliament , only the commission defended its legitimacy and i therefore thank president prodi and commissioner barnier for this , but they were alone in their endeavours and this was reflected in the final compromise .
before the nice summit the french presidency was saying ` better no agreement than a bad agreement ' , and this morning , unless i misunderstood , we were in essence told ` better a bad agreement than no agreement at all ' .
but the historic failing of nice is that your resolutions are not based on any identifiable vision for a union of 27 member states .
however , the national governments ' claim to be the constitutional legislator of europe has finally been laid to rest , as has the hope that the heads of state and government think of themselves as the trustees of the idea of european unification .
old deficits have not been made good and now new ones have come along .
mr president , first i would like to join in with the praises you have heaped upon mr brok and mr tsatsos .
i would just like to take up some of the criticisms , or lessons , i have heard here and there .
i honestly believe we have a balanced system - though i will not claim that it is simple and straightforward .
that is what i will take away from this debate , this presidency and this intergovernmental conference .
as far as the treaty of nice is concerned , we can say very little , because we do not yet have the conclusions of the european council , and therefore , until we see them , we can not add much .
for the rest the treaty is a mixture of unsatisfactory and positive things - unsatisfactory but nonetheless better than the status quo , i suppose , at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting , the extension of the codecision procedure for the european parliament , and the provisions for enhanced cooperation .
there is the fact that under enhanced cooperation the european parliament has no role , although certain leaders of national parties - including the leader of the labour party in his warsaw speech - promised no reform of the structural funds in real terms until 2013 .
mr president , mr president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are winners and losers , but europe can not claim to be one of the winners and democracy and transparency certainly can not .
it is totally unacceptable .
the outermost regions deserve better and parliament will continue to work flat out - with commissioner barnier ' s help , i am sure - to give them all the space they are entitled to within the union .
`` we were able to keep matters under our own control '' or `` we were able to block european decisions '' , they said in their own countries .
it is deplorable and the only hopeful sign is that the european commission has clearly recovered its sense of self-confidence .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i would like to start by stressing the fact that this year 's budget is due in particular to the work of all the members of the committee itself , in addition , of course , to the work of the committee chairman , mr wynn , who has steered us with wisdom through the various situations , and tense moments which we have experienced .
the member states were not afraid of public opinion at home then and the enlargement to spain and portugal was accompanied by a major mobilisation of resources .
we shall therefore be forced to accept a supplementary budget which will again seriously reduce , if not eliminate any potential savings in this category .
neither was there a qualified majority within this house to revert to article 272 .
then when i discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding article 25 of the iia , i was , to say the least , somewhat disappointed .
however , the european parliament can not carry on forever reducing its external commitments .
when we make use of 1.06 per cent of the member states ' gdp , this gives us a margin greater than ever before and greater than that predicted in berlin less than two years ago .
we must not lose our sense of environmental direction by promoting small , local measures , however badly they may be needed , or by blindly shelling out money to institutions which appear to produce little in the way of results , which applies , in my view , to the european environment agency in copenhagen .
first , the structure of the budget in 2001 : one speaker said that the agricultural budget would not rise sufficiently .
i think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving serbia the help it needs on this occasion , although i fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a european flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of europe to another , depending on where it is needed .
i am expecting a more extensive discussion to take place next month via the topical and urgent debate , and would suggest that we only give a limited preview of this debate in these resolutions .
there are various regions where we could start the ball rolling , such as the balkans , the caucasus region and central asia .
many of the transit routes for these are through areas of great conflict .
this highlights the importance of the strategy towards the russian federation and , at the same time , the importance of your report , mr oostlander .
the most important area of cooperation is energy policy , which is connected with superpower politics , which governs , for example , the transportation of oil and gas from the east to the west .
a member of my party , a radical militant journalist , was murdered several weeks ago in tbilisi , a city clearly under the control of russian troops .
a separate budgetary heading is being proposed for the northern dimension and increased aid to russia , in general , is being recommended .
it is this interest which has led the union to develop specific fields of activity in numerous areas in the common strategy towards the russian federation and other documents .
recital kk in the report states the following : ` given that russia is in a political union with belarus , it is appropriate in the interest of russia ' s democratic legitimacy for president putin and the russian government to point out clearly and consistently the comprehensive need for democratic progress and reforms in belarus , not least in the light of the report submitted by the parliamentary troika from the eu , the council of europe and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) in minsk on 16 october 2000 ' .
the northern dimension , which is important , will receive its own budget funds under this proposal , which is a very important issue .
other areas where we seek to bolster european union cooperative efforts towards russia are the rule of law and democracy building , civil society , twinnings as well as regional and cross-border cooperation and , above all , the northern dimension initiative , to which a number of members referred .
just a word on kaliningrad : the partnership and cooperation agreement already offers an institutional framework for our dialogue with russia on trade , visa and border issues .
if more favourable visa requirements are applied to the inhabitants of secessionist regions or if they are exempted altogether , this would imply support for the legitimacy of their regimes .
the question was as follows : there have been cases where this directive has been breached and gmos have been released into the environment .
i fear that you are taking us into a fundamental debate which we do not have time to go into here and now .
the council continues to be deeply concerned by the situation in chechnya , where violence continues and the humanitarian situation continues to be very worrying at the onset of winter .
could the french presidency take the baton from us and contact mr nielson , urging him to go to chechnya in the near future ?
this is not one of them . you can see for yourselves that the chamber is far from full .
mr president , i think the question was quite specific .
you are right , the fight against fraud is never sufficiently well developed .
i nonetheless believe that the proposal tabled by the french presidency is completely unacceptable and that it really has only one aim , namely to keep asylum seekers out of the eu , something which may in practice lead to an increase in illegal immigration .
last month when i asked a supplementary question in question time , this president-in-office simply avoided giving me a supplementary by saying : `` i can only repeat my previous answer '' and reading out the previous answer again .
i can assure all the members of the european parliament who have asked me questions that the council will take their comments into consideration .
the council ' s objective in all these decisions is to restore consumer confidence within the european union .
as you know , we continually act according to the latest state of our knowledge , and so i can not completely endorse this analysis .
these are the initiatives which the council has taken or intends to take with regard to the algerian authorities .
as regards your second question , the council is in complete agreement with the point of view of the general secretary of the united nations that all the institutions concerned and also experts , research bodies or academic institutions which have a special interest in children ' s issues should be involved in this exercise .
the presidency is very pleased with this result , which marks a significant stage in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy for turkey defined last year in helsinki .
i refer to guarantees such as the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one ' s own choosing or , if one has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance , to be given it free when the interests of justice so require ; to have the free assistance of an interpreter if one can not understand or speak the language used in court ; right to trial within a reasonable time , or to release pending trial .
so , as the council stated in its previous answer , the programme for mutual recognition can only bring improvements in terms of fundamental rights .
the decision to launch an operation would , in principle , take the form of a joint action .
the honourable member ' s question concerns the unofficial opinions expressed by the commission president .
mr president , i have great pleasure in presenting the report on the stabilisation and association agreement between croatia and the european union to this part session of the european parliament .
the european union emphasised this again by the summit held in zagreb on 24 november .
i can see no contradiction between the one-to-one relations between the european union and croatia and the various balkan countries , and regional cooperation .
that issue must be based on other conditions , namely whether access to asylum in croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum .
unfortunately , we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture .
we hope to make swift progress in these negotiations and to be able to conclude them rapidly .
i know that it is the strong view of the croatian government that countries participating in the stabilisation and association process must be judged on an individual basis on their own merits .
of course , in many respects the hard part is only just beginning , but i have every confidence that the people of croatia are equal to the challenge , equal to the difficult path of reform , the path to europe that now lies ahead .
the problem the government is struggling with is seen most clearly in the regions that were used as migration destinations owing to over-population , and that were also misused as conquered land .
the eu ought to take the same line .
we are very concerned and expect the european commission to respond to these developments .
but the level of this cooperation must take into account the effective progress the country may make in solving regional problems and the methods used for solving them , its respect for human rights , and also the country ' s collaboration in the positive development of the timor lorosae independence process , particularly in solving the problems faced by the west timor refugees and in prosecuting and sentencing militia members who have behaved criminally and only recently murdered three united nations workers .
the revolution in the country and the way in which it took place , remain the basis for cautious optimism .
military influence may have been reduced but is still far too great .
mrs maij-weggen has written an outstanding report and i would therefore conclude that europe must do all it can to support the country on its way to democracy , but at the end of the day , it is up to the indonesians themselves to erase the traces of the suharto regime .
she is quite forthright in naming the opposing forces of the essential and exacting process of reform .
any outside intervention other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory to all parties .
since then time has certainly not stood still in indonesia .
only two years ago indonesia was still ruled by a military-backed authoritarian leader .
the debate is closed .
meanwhile parts of it have become out-dated and the nice summit has not improved matters either .
however , we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection .
mr president , i can be very brief because this is not the first discussion we have held on the issue .
we do not believe that more solutions at community level can improve the fight against crime because the efforts will be characterised by just as much indifference , slovenliness and secrecy as the eu ' s administration in general .
my personal view is that the european public prosecutor is just the first step along the road to corpus juris , a body of common law across the continent .
we lose serious amounts of money because it is not collected by the member states .
you know that the commission would have preferred olaf to be set up as a totally independent authority .
we must not forget that it was the reluctance of parliament to give the green light to the way euro-taxpayers ' money was spent in 1996 that precipitated the fall of the commission in 1999 .
we depend on the court of auditors to provide us with the ammunition to fire at the problem areas .
we are trying to watch the commission and the member states and this report is an attempt at doing that .
mr president , i would like to start by commending the timeliness of this initiative and the diligence with which our rapporteur , eluned morgan , has carried it out .
in the final analysis , we must be able to assess whether it is getting better or worse .
for in fact , the commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions , especially with regard to the flã © chard affair .
i am sure that this house wishes her every success in that particular project , although i am slightly worried that the baby 's first words might include the words `` discharge '' and `` procedure '' .
let me point out to mrs stauner who just raised certain questions that under this agreement the committee chairperson puts questions regarding confidential information to the commission or forwards them to it .
once again , congratulations on your report .
to inscribe in a directive that shareholders must be paid an equitable price is about as useful as saying that an apple will fall from the tree when it is ripe .
so i can only ask this house to endorse the committee on legal affairs and the internal market 's compromise amendments .
to be effective , useful and in the public interest , such a directive must : first , avoid direct involvement of the courts , but rather have a regulator with wide powers of discretion under the rule of law ; secondly , clarify and have workable rules on jurisdiction ; thirdly , clarify definitions of equitable price and set proper thresholds ; fourthly , ensure management can not improperly frustrate shareholders taking their legitimate decisions about the future of the company in which they own a stake .
it is true that the european parliament rules of procedure do not make this easy , making these debates into a pure and simple dialogue between the deaf .
lastly , the issue of clarity : the lack of this is especially evident in the debate about jurisdiction , an issue of which i have a little experience .
the european institutions care little about the job losses and closures caused by almost every company takeover or merger .
if , moreover , we open the door to defensive measures , we shall perhaps make it more difficult to restructure european markets and , especially , to protect small shareholders .
hitherto we have not had binding rules on take-overs either in community law or in the legislation of a good number of member states .
mr president , i would like to thank parliament for the attention it is giving this proposal and for the work that the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and particularly the rapporteur , mr lehne , have carried out .
these only concern holders of securities in the first case and the supervisory authority in the second .
the third part of it is unacceptable for the same reason that no so-called ` social amendments ' are acceptable .
that is not acceptable in the european market and is contrary to the requirements of the single market .
this is based on the quite mistaken assumption that it is compulsory to involve collective management firms , as has hitherto been the case in austria .
the socialist group did not therefore want parliament to discredit itself by accepting proposals which make a mockery of the votes cast at the first reading .
the opinions expressed on the right of resale reflect the views not of the political groups but of the member states .
there is kã '' nstler gegen folgerecht .
at any event , why as a matter of principle should it be right to impose a levy on the sale of a second-hand picture and not to do the same to the maker of a second-hand car or the tailor of a second-hand suit ?
amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 7 which relates to this issue should also be rejected for the same reasons .
it seems to me an impossible state of affairs when we are debating a very important subject and amendments have come in late , together with those that went to committee , and we do not have them in our mother tongue .
for that reason , conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation .
we decided in committee to leave the question of special services as it is regulated in directive 97/67/ec .
madam president , there would be much more to say , but i shall confine myself to adding that only rarely has there been such political consensus on an issue among the various committees called upon to express their opinions in this parliament .
that is our responsibility .
however , my group also takes the view that we as a community and as member states must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too .
yet we are expected to go along the lines that the commission wanted without ever seeing those so-called studies .
we often pontificate here about being the representatives of the citizens of europe .
we are now facing a peculiar situation , really .
secondly , reference is made to the 1997 directive .
i would be very clear on one particular matter .
while electronic communication , such as e-mail , has enjoyed a real boom , former state monopolies are mainly turning inward .
there is a connection between all of this .
i speak in support of the 150-gramme limit for reasons of caution .
i am not a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the market or of liberalisation , but the request that was made for a systematic , professional and painstaking analysis of all the implications of the directive has not been met , and that is why i am prepared to accept the present compromise proposal .
fortunately , there is a directive in place which prescribes transparency for public companies , and i can assure you that gross subsidies will be monitored at very close range .
you do not appear to have learnt anything , and you do not appear to have listened to the arguments that were put to you .
consumers will lose out , employees will lose out , europe will lose competitive strength and growth .
the proposed liberalisation has sweeping implications for the services in rural areas , for employees of postal companies and for private users of the post .
it is regrettable that the commission opted instead to bulldoze ahead with the ideological proposal that fails to pay attention to the views of the people .
this sector is already suffering from enormous competition from those new technologies .
when the left-wing coalition cites realism in an attempt to obtain a compromise solution with a right-wing party , it is a way of disguising its own capitulation to private interests .
this is more than enough to support the public tasks , such as adequate universal provision of services and a uniform rate .
i do not take any lessons from the labour party about the rural areas .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who indeed had a difficult task .
it is a decision that you will regret .
mr president , the commission realises from previous discussions the great importance of this subject for parliament and i have carefully looked at the numerous amendments to the proposed directive .
in short it would be too little , too late , and would bring to a sudden halt the much needed momentum for further change , gravely harming the incumbent adaptation and threatening long-term employment .
firstly , the chief executive of the uk post office , mr john roberts , has talked about competition leading to improvements in quality and efficiency and lower prices .
the monopoly of postal services would cause them to ossify and lose volume which would lead to losses of jobs .
we must maintain the momentum for change and achieve a solid first step , plus a timetable for further change .
i notice that the postal services are helping us to warm up the house a little , and i am glad about that .
in particular , the report proposed rejecting the automatic transition to a ` tariff only ' system , a rating preference for the acp countries of at least eur 300 and an assessment and possible revision of the com ' s internal aspects .
other than that our position thus remains the same : apply the system for at least ten years in order to guarantee producers ' and operators ' legal security and then re-examine the system at the end of the ten years ; no automatic transition to a ` tariff only ' system ; and a rating preference of eur 300 for the acp countries .
mr schwaiger said during the previous debate that you should have information which further supplements all the different points of view on the problem .
the workings of the compromise that has been reached , which comes within the wto rules , must be studied by the european commission in a report which will have to be studied by parliament within a reasonable time limit and , in accordance with the result of that report and the study made of it , the appropriate corrective measures will have to be proposed , as mr dary ' s report suggests .
mr president , for perplexed observers such as myself , this issue is moving from the bizarre to the surreal .
strong forces are lined up against us .
however , i believe that we can forecast negative effects on the smaller commercial operators and on producers in the acp countries .
mr president , may i first of all highlight parliament ' s effort in reaching a balanced solution to this complex web of interests that surrounds the com in bananas .
the dispute with the wto has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in member states who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors .
the important thing is to gain time in this final straight and i propose that we vote in favour of mr dary ' s report .
mr president , once again , the house is going to deliver its opinion on the banana issue , and i congratulate michel dary on his remarkable work .
we wish to strengthen our cooperation with the republic of korea and we now have an excellent opportunity to discuss the events that have recently taken place on the korean peninsular .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , may i confirm the position which mr bolkestein set out yesterday evening on behalf of the commission .
( the president declared the common position approved as amended )
it therefore now reads `` croatian citizens of serb origin '' .
( parliament accepted the oral amendment )
i wish to support the decisive decision by the ep to vote for the introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets , this is a huge breakthrough for public health as we now have labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the real cost of smoking .
the european court of justice has now confirmed that my position was correct .
so this move will not lead to healthier cigarettes being smoked - but simply to export jobs from europe .
they have misled people for far too long .
note that these are major programmes aimed at improvements in public health , the fight against cancer , aids prevention , the fight against drug dependence , health monitoring and pollution-related diseases .
i do not see why we can not entrust the management of their own social welfare to the public as well .
well , in my opinion , we should also do something - i would advocate in the near future - about artists ' pensions .
this is why i am of the opinion that the international art market will move outside of europe as a result of the directive .
- ( fr ) apart from its seeking to make an impact by setting out good intentions regarding stability , the rule of law and the fight against corruption , the oostlander report is in fact nothing more than a vote of confidence in mr putin .
maij-weggen report ( a5-0323 / 2000 )
and if we add to the corruption of the european public employees the corruption of the employees of the national state bodies , then the result will be an increase in fraud .
the creation of this new authority must not lead to any transfer of sovereignty in core areas .
i should like , therefore , to apologise to the president-in-office of the council and to the house .
i have received many letters about the fact that it is an emotive issue .
there must be a balance as a whole .
however , the commission can certainly give you this information annually in parliament on the basis of the information available to us at the time .
on amendments nos 19 and 32 , concerning organically produced bananas , may i say once again that there are already horizontal measures in place to guarantee the equivalence of organic bananas from third countries with those produced in the community .
the better the relationship , the safer the world and the better off our people .
there are some differences in our approach to these matters , but i hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including tiered pricing .
from kosovo to belfast , millions of european citizens have cause to be thankful for the contribution he has made and i know that the house will join with me in paying tribute to that contribution today .
i believe you touched on an important point there .
'' lesotho has said : `` what has the wto market liberalisation brought to lesotho ?
i believe that advantage should be taken of the dialogue that exists between the european union and the united states in order to finally achieve this objective .
i was interested by what mrs lucas said about world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that increasingly free trade works in the interests of the poor as well as the better off .
that concludes this item .
i am stressing this because some of the amendments intend to establish a zero rate of vat for services which , in my opinion , are not of an essential or social nature .
in my view , this solution resolves the problem of eliminating previous discrimination and achieves the objective of simplification .
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the commission and parliament have in recent years made great efforts to achieve harmonisation in the levying of vat within the european union .
the industry committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three .
there are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context .
plenty of reason , therefore , to take a close look at whether aviation is carrying its external costs and not prejudicing the train or bus owing to unfair competition .
if the transaction takes place within the european union between two member states , vat is levied .
it is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day .
therefore , we liberals share the commission 's ambitions , but we find it very hard to understand the specific proposals put forward by the commission .
i think it is important to establish some criteria .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal of the european commission intended to make the purchasing of digital products which can be downloaded directly from the internet by consumers resident in the union from extra-community firms subject to vat is a heavy blow for the development of e-commerce .
therefore , as to the commission 's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced , i can only express my neutrality .
i oppose mrs torres marques ' call for harmonisation of vat , but what i would really like to address is the garcãa - margallo report on e-commerce .
all states redistribute at least 30 % , often 40 % and occasionally more than 50 % of their national wealth created during the year .
minimum rates , and possibly a maximum rate , are needed , but the states need to be allowed room for manoeuvre to enable them to pursue their own microeconomic policies .
i personally tabled an amendment on the harmonisation of vat rates , which would correct the effects of unfair competition resulting from third country operators ' power to choose when it comes to registering , since there is a very broad range of vat rates available to them - between 15 and 25 % - while domestic operators have no choice .
if we were now to go it alone in europe and tax aircraft fuel , european operators would scarcely be able to compete with airlines based outside europe .
that is not how we are meant to organise society , and that is why i think this proposal is an excellent one .
not only would our air fares increase dramatically - possibly by â # 80 per ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carriers - but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers , tourism , businesses and , of course , the freight carriers - they now carry a third of freight world-wide by air .
like mr skinner , i think that the proposals from the rapporteur , mr garcãa - margallo y marfil , regarding vat on e-commerce are good .
i only intend to speak about the taxation of aviation fuel .
to levy vat on third-country suppliers , largely american , is not only impractical but , in the case of newspapers and books , it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop .
one last point is that the eu should not legislate in haste and should make every effort to strengthen e-commerce and to avoid undermining it .
the outcome of that consultation was discussed within ecofin at the end of november .
all in all , a number of details still need to be looked at .
it is in the light of this that this proposal is seeking to maintain the existing level of harmonisation in the field of vat rates by confirming the minimum level of 15 % for the normal rate .
i would , however , like to point out that current community tax legislation does not allow for only national and intra-community flights to be taxed .
one year after the sinking of the erika , we must all ask ourselves whether or not we have really been able to meet the expectations of europe ' s citizens .
in the event that the imo does not adopt the necessary measures , the commission would submit a proposal to parliament and the council on a community system for responsibility and compensation in the event of pollution by hydrocarbons .
parliament took its decision on 30 november ; you presented a good document , and we decided quickly .
with regard to the issue of responsibility , i will only say that the current fund is not sufficient to provide compensation for all the damage caused by the erika oil slick .
mr ortuondo , in relation to your intervention on article 6 , on responsibility in the case of less serious pollution , i can tell you that the first thing i am going to find out is what the council thinks , but parliament has already adopted a position on this issue .
the overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the eu internal market .
i thought mine and this would be coupled together but apparently that is not the procedure in this house .
policy towards imports from third countries will be decided in the light of this assessment .
the role of the european union can not be to fund incitement to hatred and warfare .
i have asked you about the commission ' s participation in educational programmes , and you avoided the question .
will he look at ways of expanding that section of the community 's budget ?
let me say about texaco that the centre for economic and social rights says that in ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates .
how does it intend to guarantee the survival of what remains of the industry from january 2001 onwards in the face of unfair competition from korea , further evidence of which is contained in its latest report ?
commissioner , firstly , to a certain extent i feel reassured because i notice that the commission has been concerned with , and has perhaps also done something about , this problem .
we believe that would not be represented by an across-the-board continuation of the existing operating aid but rather by the commission being prepared to come up with a focused and specific instrument in the event of the actions undertaken by commissioner lamy on behalf of the commission not being successful for the european union industry .
the increase in prices which would result from the anti-dumping measures should enable the coke industry to become profitable again .
this proposal , which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the community in favour of least and less developed countries , is aimed at promoting the integration of these countries into the world economy .
i am sure all my colleagues are very grateful .
this ties in with mrs kinnock ' s question .
to that end , could you perhaps reassure me firstly when the impact assessment will be available to us so that we can cite it to perhaps explode some of the apocalyptic claims that have surrounded your proposal and , secondly , give some more details about the safeguard clause which i think you are considering introducing into this measure and also the transition period before the measure finally gets implemented ?
these different instruments are also open to organisations like ecpat and their partners in the countries concerned .
we have had a particular project for that .
this is why the patent office is based in munich .
that is certainly an understandable point of view , which i share .
accordingly , the commission will take all measures which it deems necessary .
the commission would like to inform the honourable member that a complaint is pending regarding the thessaloniki underground rail project .
in this context , i would also like to point out that the plaintiff , from the time that the franchise agreement was made public in greece , has taken eight months to make up his own mind and lodge his complaint with the commission .
it is up to the member state to decide whether a strike is legal .
i should like to thank the commissioner for attempting to answer my question , but i should point out that students in greece are currently somewhat confused because the free study centres are claiming that they are able to issue study diplomas which qualify for recognition under directive 89/48/eec , if , and provided that , the course in question is completed in britain , while the greek authorities and the competent bodies are refusing to recognise diplomas issued for courses completed in britain .
declaring the island of raippaluoto off vaasa an independent kingdom , through which shipping firms can pass and thus continue their tax-free sales .
however , i am certain i can say on behalf of my colleague michel barnier that the facts which have been mentioned by the honourable member will duly be taken into account when an analysis is made of that proposal .
if i can say briefly what is important in my report and what i believe is the key priority for this parliament , it is the issue of linguistic diversity .
it is essential that we sell to them the potential gains and opportunities of investing in companies that are taking on board linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information .
this means that digital content offers an opportunity to all those who have not had access to schooling , be it lifelong training or because they are handicapped , and i want digital content to make a better approach to such people possible .
similarly , we need localisation of content production , which is a means of adapting products according to linguistic and cultural needs and the liking of consumers .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs gill on her report .
the content providers , the creative element , the people who are ultimately responsible for the production of content , the very people who are targeted by the e-content programme should therefore be involved in the consultation process .
before i conclude , allow me to raise a final important point , a final question addressed to the commission .
i would like to thank parliament for its strong support for the budget of the programme .
the debate is closed .
i now give the floor to the rapporteur , mr de roo .
too much noise from infrastructure affects the health of human beings , and reduces their quality of life .
in this proposal , the environmental committee lays down specific standards for the years 2006 , 2012 and 2020 .
all the more reason , therefore , for a people ' s party such as ours , the ppe-de , not to let aviation escape european legislation and to scrap the distinction made between military and civil aviation .
my group , however , does not support the rapporteur 's intention to use the directive to introduce limit values for ambient noise in the vicinity of airports .
i therefore agree with the rapporteur , mr de roo , when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive .
another group may claim that the proposal contains technical problems .
it would be the member states who would determine the length of that period , according to their own customs .
i have certainly been astounded to hear one or two speakers say that we need daughter directives .
so we do need a framework directive and we need the combined approach , and i therefore regard much of what the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has decided as right and proper .
that is not what we want .
getting comparable information about the noise around airports will be a big step forward .
the debate is closed .
this study has never been carried out .
mr president , at this late hour and with a piece of carrot stuck in my throat , i doubt whether i have much else to say to my fellow meps .
these people have knowledge , accumulated over many years , about cellulose as a binding agent , particularly in bread .
as i already explained during second reading , there is a crisis underlying this directive amendment .
in my opinion , our parliament is tightening up on the council ' s common position considerably and i recommend approval of the common draft text .
i would like to thank the european parliament for its support of the european commission 's position and the remarkable effort made to meet the concerns of the council .
we know that the commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the european union , and that should be ready in six months ' time .
as a legislative institution we should not seek at any time to exacerbate the urban/rural divide .
the appropriations would be mainly allocated to networks of towns and cities organised at european level and in order to support their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices where sustainable urban development is concerned .
in practice , it is also at the local level that the environmental decisions we take here in parliament are to be implemented .
i believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow .
the commission can not accept amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 31 , 38 and 39 .
indeed , even if it is only recently that the media have begun publicising it , the precautionary principle has not only just made its appearance on the international legal scene .
- ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the legal affairs committee identified a few key points concerning the precautionary principle , reflecting concerns which are also expressed in mrs patrie 's excellent report .
the public no longer wants to bear the brunt of hazardous technological innovations which several or many years later prove to have entailed unnecessary risk to public health or the environment .
i am in favour of the precautionary principle , but i would like to mention one area of concern .
there are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well .
firstly , that there is no minimum threshold of risk below which the precautionary principle must not be applied and , consequently , even in cases where there is little risk , it would have to be used .
in my amendments which i have tabled , i attempt to clarify these matters and delete a number of redundant paragraphs .
it is incomprehensible that the european union should remain insensitive to the dozens of independent scientific studies that point to the possible risk posed by mobile telephones to human health .
producers and manufacturers must be able to present proof that a product is in fact safe .
mr president , adapted to every contingency , according to the circumstances and interests of the moment , the precautionary principle may be either the best of things or the worst of things .
we consider it as a general principle which should be taken into consideration in the fields of environmental protection and human , animal and plant health .
thank you , commissioner liikanen .
our european community is above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law .
we know that we are not important individually , but we believe that what unites and motivates us is important : the rejection of eta ' s criminal terrorism and explicit support for the spanish rule of law , which today is being threatened by a totalitarian project for violent secession .
ladies and gentlemen , as democrats , we are , of course , in favour of dialogue between different democratic parties , because democracy itself is embodied in that ongoing dialogue .
we have now signed the budget for 2001 .
( in successive votes , parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions )
( parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment being tabled ) ( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before we proceed to the explanations of votes , i would like to wish all those members i will not be seeing afterwards a very merry christmas .
since it was set up , the cohesion fund has had a considerable impact on two areas of great community interest - the environment and trans-european transport networks ; it has been effectively implemented in the community budget and has had one of the highest implementation rates in the entire community budget .
we are asking for a considerable supplementary and amending budget in january to demonstrate the interest that parliament intends to give to this dossier .
this also means , of course , that the government of luxembourg is once more being called upon not only to be vigilant but also to guarantee compliance with contractual agreements .
this needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future , partly so as to provide room for the enlargement of the eu .
mr president , i voted for this report on food additives and , in particular , for the ban on using sodium alginate to preserve carrots .
i suggest that he also sends a copy to malta , since the only time he has failed to give an explanation of vote was , i believe , when we were discussing malta .
today i voted in favour of the ferber report on `` european postal services '' because , given the current balance of power in europe and within the european parliament , we obtained as much as we could to prevent the total disappearance of public postal services in europe !
i am truly sorry that parliament voted to support a policy that is very harmful as far as consumers are concerned .
i emphatically reject such insinuations .
it is not good enough to call for liberalisation without realising the effects of our decisions .
in sweden a number of these proposals have already been implemented and we can already see that this has exacerbated the situation .
we hope there will now be speedy negotiations to agree arrangements compatible with our wto commitments and safeguard our traditional suppliers .
let me make this quite clear : i am aware of the importance of this body , but what i , like others , refuse to accept is globalisation !
secondly , the report takes an approach to linguistic and cultural diversity which is too negative .
europe is clearly in a position to respond to the challenge of the markets , due to its advantages in economic and employment terms , and , of course , due to its cultural wealth and linguistic diversity - which are shown clearly in the concept of linguistic minorities and regional languages - over the monolingualism that characterises much of the `` web '' .
mr president , i asked my daughter elisabetta , who , as you know , is the regional representative of the pensioners ' party for lombardy - to give me her opinion on the nice council and to tell me whether she felt i should vote for the motion .
the european union is now ready for the candidate countries to join .
they may have succeeded in this , at least for the moment , but at the cost of serious problems , such as greater supranationality , less democracy and greater german influence in the decision-making process .
some people may consider this development to be perfectly legitimate , because it tends to transpose the weighting of each country into the institutions according to the size of their populations .
there is thus a real risk that it will become more difficult to implement essential legislation on the environment , consumer protection and the working environment , and we strongly recommend the states to demonstrate responsibility and to make the decision-making procedures in the council more efficient .
the negotiations were tough but the strength of the union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all .
this situation is exacerbated by the extension of decision making by qualified majority , under which , in certain circumstances , only 14 countries can make decisions on behalf of the 27 or 28 , thus , in practice , eliminating the right of veto on policies that are highly important for portugal , such as the structural funds or commercial policy agreements .
unanimous decisions , and hence an inherent incapacity to act , remain largely the norm in the council .
in our view , for as long as europe is what it is , questions of a constitutional nature or of fundamental interest for the states , such as those that were debated in nice , should not be resolved by any other means ; that is , they should require unanimity .
it increases the power of the big countries at the expense of the small countries .
not only reduced staffing levels and other cuts , but also government policy have brought the prices down .
' ` well , let 's go to bed and make love . '
while the commission proposes a switch from project-based to programme-based funding , on which opinions may well be divided - i , for one , believe that it represents a loss of european added value , visibility and closeness to the people and , moreover , not all member states have established the requisite regional authorities - the financing of innovative measures from the european social fund remains project-based .
the trick is to know which will succeed and flourish but we should also have the strength to know that when something has failed we should not prop it up at public expense and develop a strategy that takes this into account .
tourism is an important means of livelihood in many remote areas as well .
it is a good report , based on a good paper from the commission .
i particularly agree with his consideration that regional policy instruments should be directed towards sustainability , strengthening economic and social cohesion and , above all , creating skilled , economically viable , lasting jobs .
one is that we - and the people out there - see that the innovative measures have been a very important stepping stone for local authorities and local communities who are not really into the structural funds , but should be , to learn how to do it through small-scale projects and then be able to become more effective parts of mainstream programmes in future years .
the door is closed to them and we have lost that added value provided by the direct relationship between the european capital and the public institutions closest to the problems of the citizens .
that is why we selected these three priorities - technological innovation , the information society and regional identity and sustainable development - as our strategic priorities .
i understand your wish to maintain direct links between the european union and regional and local players .
thank you , commissioner .
the decision taken by the council and the commission to negotiate for four months without continuing the payment of aid and then , after 1 may 2001 , to reconsider , on the basis of the progress achieved in these negotiations , whether there are grounds for resuming aid payments for a further period will mean that european shipyards will receive virtually no new orders in the first four months of the year 2001 , at least not for the shipping categories in which competition is fiercest .
other countries - japan for one - are also suffering from this .
we are also worried about the sixth framework programme for research and development : the ` marine technology ' line in the fifth programme appears to have disappeared in the draft programme .
mr president , it seems to have become an end-of-year tradition to hold a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding industry .
in recent weeks , the commission has told us that the system of subsidies , thanks to which our industry is subsisting , must be removed as from january as a result of a supposed improvement in competitiveness .
in other words , the state is paying a large chunk , if not all of the company 's profits .
and that is due to the fact that we are incapable of condemning a situation of unfair competition .
discussions in the oecd have made little progress , very little progress , and the possibility of an internationally binding agreement on shipbuilding seems remote .
it requested the commission to continue with its market monitoring , to follow up closely on the tbr case with a view to bring the problem to the wto if required and to address the issue in all relevant international fora .
british submarine at gibraltar
there , showing themselves to be fully in charge , they parked it .
mr president , with regard to the repair of the british submarine tireless in gibraltar , we should remember what we want from the commission .
i would modestly like to suggest that they vote for our motion for a resolution .
secondly , it must demand that all possible information be given to the population , as laid down in the euratom treaty .
honourable members have asked a number of questions relating to the presence of the british nuclear submarine hms tireless in gibraltar for repairs to her nuclear reactor .
the british authorities state that there will be no shipment of radioactive waste that will transit through any other member state ; they also state that they are in regular contact with the spanish authorities .
this is a technical problem with a technical solution and the sooner the repair is completed , the better it will be for all .
we all support the right of self-determination .
it is significant first and foremost , and this is the point i should like to stress , because it illustrates the current state of our so-called united europe and , from this point of view , sovereignists may even find it amusing .
it is scandalous that , at this moment , 11 out of the 12 hunter-killer submarines in service in the royal navy are non-operational , with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts hms tireless .
this specific issue is more serious than all that , since it affects hundreds of thousands of human beings on community territory , not only spaniards , but people of all nationalities and british people in particular .
i would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the commission that it is not the view of the uk government that the euratom treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind .
those feelings have understandably been reflected during this debate , but honourable members know that in responding on behalf of my colleague , commissioner wallstrã ¶ m , i have to restrict myself to setting out as clearly as i can what is and what is not community competence : what we can do and what we can not do .
b5-0928 / 2000 by watson , on behalf of the eldr group ,
the suicide rate is particularly high among young people who can no longer endure their bleak situations .
it has taken part in specific operations when asked to do so by the secretary-general or another authority of the united nations , in agreement with the countries concerned .
we will continue to follow that model for our proposals on the successor instrument to the dublin convention , conditions to qualify as a refugee on the basis of the geneva convention , and on subsidiary forms of protection .
the commission is also working closely with the unhcr in trying to ensure a smooth transition between relief and development .
b5-0929 / 2000 by haarder and malmstrã ¶ m , on behalf of the eldr group ,
we were told that mr solana was understanding of these demands but it was also pointed out that - and i quote - the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to do business with a regime such as that of milosevic .
that may be linked with an amnesty , or their release may precede the amnesty .
the request to president kostunica to release all political prisoners from the milosevic era , requires , as before , unrelenting diplomatic effort on the part of the european council and commission in belgrade , especially since most serb political prisoners , if not those of albanian origin from kosovo , have , as far as i know , now been released .
i can assure honourable members that it is an issue which i will take up - not least as a result of this debate - on the next visit i make to belgrade after the elections on 23 december .
mozambique - b5-0907 / 2000 by queirã ³ , on behalf of the uen group ;
on tunisia .
i recall that in the european parliament mission to argentina , former president alfonsãn said to us that sometimes democracies only remember other democracies post mortem , that is , when there is no longer democracy .
mr president , although this parliament is bringing southern africa back to our agenda and particularly mozambique , one of the poorest countries in the world , which , as we know , was devastated exactly a year ago by a huge natural disaster .
we regret that the other political groups were not willing to do so on this occasion .
therefore , what we are kindly asking the commission here is that there should be strict monitoring of the conditions in that country which , of course , does not deserve to be considered to be respecting human rights .
tunisia
one example is mehdi zougah , a french-tunisian citizen , who was arrested at tunis airport on 11 august .
the aloes publishing house , which has been closed down several times , is prevented from publishing freely .
the reasons for prosecution are very unclear .
mr president , first of all i would like to express my thanks for the solidarity expressed by other colleagues due to the recent assassination by the terrorist group eta .
the call for a meeting of the association council on the human rights situation in tunisia should be followed by real action ...
our experience in chile in the field of democracy and human rights has therefore been crucial for later projects in other countries .
we will , over the coming weeks , have to take account of the results of the dialogue between the two political leaders , or of the absence of such a dialogue .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions .
it is no coincidence that the oau and numerous african heads of state have condemned the concept of ivorian identity outright .
the collapse of cocoa prices , the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices , among other factors , have led to an internal situation of growing tension , a notable decline in the social climate and an increase in unemployment and poverty .
we in this parliament must stand up for the rights of the people of cã ´ te d'ivoire - and everywhere else - to a fair and properly organised democratic system with a non-partisan judiciary .
i want to make it clear that the commission shares parliament 's view that the process of transition from military coup to elected government in cã ´ te d'ivoire has fallen , to put it mildly , far short of the sort of democratic standards that we want to see .
as for the slanderous allusions directed at me , i have to say that it is not my normal attitude and that at no time did i wish to alter the normal conduct of the debate .
as the honourable member knows , i have already addressed the parliament twice this afternoon on this issue , but what i discussed was the commission 's competence , not its omni-competence .
it must respect the treaty , and the protocol appended to the treaty states quite clearly that the twelve monthly part-sessions are to be held in strasbourg .
this issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part , and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile , substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and , most importantly , to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource : first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource , a cultural resource and , lastly , that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations .
the problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time , as the european union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress , the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens .
low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the european parliament should have tackled far earlier .
in fact , this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it .
the oeso has been carrying out research into this area for some years now and has published reports on this topic .
their valuable contribution to our society is hugely neglected in this report .
mr president , the commission communication is , i think , a milestone in the history of social policy because it marks the end of a period in which senior citizens were seen as a generation of outcasts or veterans .
as the markets are only interested in young people and their purchasing power , it falls to politicians to attend to the issue of older people .
one colleague has said that it is not we who are living for too long , it is not our society which is too old , but that centuries ago people had to die much earlier than the good lord had preordained in our genes .
this is a miscalculation , considering the current and future demographic situation , and also considering the fact that today ' s working population will be tomorrow ' s non-working population , in economic terms .
the fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of age was , of course , confirmed in my report on article 13 , which i was able to present to the house in october .
i do not necessarily think that all women should go out to work either , because we are after all calling for the labour force penetration rate of women to be increased through changes in family and tax policy .
i have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in mont-dauphin and brianã § on .
what is more , age-related issues are amongst the most important objectives setting the agenda in the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
this approach is a welcome one , and is similar to that already employed to promote agricultural products in third countries .
perhaps this fact will instil a spirit of unanimity in us , which would , doubtless , knowing the great-heartedness of the commission , lead it to accept all our amendments .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the wto working group and as someone responsible , in particular , for small and medium-sized enterprises , i can only congratulate the commission on this report and on this initiative , because it is far-sighted in already anticipating developments , which bodes well for the future .
obviously , this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant , and new opportunities are emerging which , at the end of the day , need to be taken .
we now hope that parliament will fall in line with them across the board , and i , of course , urge my own group to give you its complete support .
the practice of mixing a fat into calf feed which comes from meat meal production - which in any case is highly dubious given the risk of bse transmission - creates in my opinion a centre of infection for young animals .
the system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the eu ' s agricultural policy .
i sincerely hope that it is not anyone 's ideological view of what is safe and right that will be put forward , but information with a proper scientific basis .
this concept of thematic information provision and promotional measures complementing national and regional measures requires strong commitment on the part of the member states , in the form of co-financing and support for administering and monitoring the measures to be implemented .
i appear to be the last speaker in the year 2000 , although not by design .
to return to set-aside , if you looked , you would be able to see that , in practice , set-aside is not caused by crop rotation , but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals .
please think of the extra few seconds that i gave you , mrs lulling , as your christmas present .
i can fully concur with the view taken by my colleague , mr jan mulder , in this respect .
