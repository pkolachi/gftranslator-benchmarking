8.6506	Iceland is a little country far north in the cold sea .
0.8226	Men found it and went there to live more than a thousand years ago .
24.9693	During the warm season they used to fish and make fish-oil and hunt sea-birds and gather feathers and tend their sheep and make hay .
11.0032	But the winters were long and dark and cold .
4.8639	Men and women and children stayed in the house and carded and spun and wove and knit .
3.2316	A whole family sat for hours around the fire in the middle of the room .
8.5280	That fire gave the only light .
9.8455	Shadows flitted in the dark corners .
6.8650	Smoke curled along the high beams in the ceiling .
4.4363	The children sat on the dirt floor close by the fire .
8.6624	The grown people were on a long narrow bench that they had pulled up to the light and warmth .
8.8267	Everybody 's hands were busy with wool .
1.5648	The work left their minds free to think and their lips to talk .
10.0600	What was there to talk about ?
4.4107	The summer 's fishing , the killing of a fox , a voyage to Norway .
6.2313	But the people grew tired of this little gossip .
0.2075	Fathers looked at their children and thought : `` They are not learning much .
9.0765	What will make them brave and wise ?
8.9338	What will teach them to love their country and old Norway ?
11.9990	Will not the stories of battles , of brave deeds , of mighty men , do this ? ''
82.1200	So , as the family worked in the red fire-light , the father told of the kings of Norway , of long voyages to strange lands , of good fights .
27.2071	And in farmhouses all through Iceland these old tales were told over and over until everybody knew them and loved them .
6.8672	Some men could sing and play the harp .
6.7628	This made the stories all the more interesting .
2.9681	People called such men `` skalds , '' and they called their songs `` sagas . ''
7.5611	Every midsummer there was a great meeting .
6.9278	Men from all over Iceland came to it and made laws .
0.5775	During the day there were rest times , when no business was going on .
87.5337	Then some skald would take his harp and walk to a large stone or a knoll and stand on it and begin a song of some brave deed of an old Norse hero .
35.3610	At the first sound of the harp and the voice , men came running from all directions , crying out : `` The skald !
10.8352	The skald !
9.8432	A saga ! ''
14.5831	They stood about for hours and listened .
10.9260	They shouted applause .
12.0380	When the skald was tired , some other man would come up from the crowd and sing or tell a story .
96.9486	As the skald stepped down from his high position , some rich man would rush up to him and say : `` Come and spend next winter at my house .
8.0942	Our ears are thirsty for song . ''
5.9019	So the best skalds traveled much and visited many people .
9.2024	Their songs made them welcome everywhere .
5.8304	They were always honored with good seats at a feast .
8.6684	They were given many rich gifts .
58.6466	Even the King of Norway would sometimes send across the water to Iceland , saying to some famous skald : `` Come and visit me .
9.7906	You shall not go away empty-handed .
12.5274	Men say that the sweetest songs are in Iceland .
7.7036	I wish to hear them . ''
8.7554	These tales were not written .
12.8849	Few men wrote or read in those days .
9.2172	Skalds learned songs from hearing them sung .
7.6806	At last people began to write more easily .
5.0859	Then they said : `` These stories are very precious .
2.5475	We must write them down to save them from being forgotten . ''
7.8328	After that many men in Iceland spent their winters in writing books .
4.7103	They wrote on sheepskin ; vellum , we call it .
62.5231	Many of these old vellum books have been saved for hundreds of years , and are now in museums in Norway .
0.1944	Some leaves are lost , some are torn , all are yellow and crumpled .
8.9544	But they are precious .
6.6290	They tell us all that we know about that olden time .
46.8782	There are the very words that the men of Iceland wrote so long ago -- stories of kings and of battles and of ship-sailing .
3.5237	Some of those old stories I have told in this book .
24.2307	King Halfdan lived in Norway long ago .
20.2992	One morning his queen said to him : `` I had a strange dream last night .
4.1657	I thought that I stood in the grass before my bower .
7.8820	I pulled a thorn from my dress .
0.1999	As I held it in my fingers , it grew into a tall tree .
19.0945	The trunk was thick and red as blood , but the lower limbs were fair and green , and the highest ones were white .
26.3913	I thought that the branches of this great tree spread so far that they covered all Norway and even more . ''
12.7658	`` A strange dream , '' said King Halfdan .
6.4817	`` Dreams are the messengers of the gods .
2.8953	I wonder what they would tell us , '' and he stroked his beard in thought .
4.6368	Some time after that a serving-woman came into the feast hall where King Halfdan was .
6.2488	She carried a little white bundle in her arms .
5.0881	`` My lord , '' she said , `` a little son is just born to you . ''
8.4583	`` Ha ! ''
12.3678	cried the king , and he jumped up from the high seat and hastened forward until he stood before the woman .
6.9221	`` Show him to me ! ''
4.5460	he shouted , and there was joy in his voice .
0.2626	The serving-woman put down her bundle on the ground and turned back the cloth .
8.6843	There was a little naked baby .
8.5273	The king looked at it carefully .
1.3759	`` It is a goodly youngster , '' he said , and smiled .
15.8332	`` Bring Ivar and Thorstein . ''
6.3186	They were captains of the king 's soldiers .
10.0653	Soon they came .
12.4507	`` Stand as witnesses , '' Halfdan said .
11.4220	Then he lifted the baby in his arms , while the old serving-woman brought a silver bowl of water .
13.8901	The king dipped his hand into it and sprinkled the baby , saying : `` I own this baby for my son .
16.6366	He shall be called Harald .
9.9992	My naming gift to him is ten pounds of gold . ''
2.8419	Then the woman carried the baby back to the queen 's room .
2.2990	`` My lord owns him for his son , '' she said .
8.8159	`` And no wonder !
7.3958	He is perfect in every limb . ''
6.2525	The queen looked at him and smiled and remembered her dream and thought : `` That great tree !
6.9295	Can it be this little baby of mine ? ''
21.7525	When Harald was seven months old he cut his first tooth .
162.4697	Then his father said : `` All the young of my herds , lambs and calves and colts , that have been born since this baby was born I this day give to him .
10.1884	I also give to him this thrall , Olaf .
6.0297	These are my tooth-gifts to my son . ''
16.8925	The boy grew fast , for as soon as he could walk about he was out of doors most of the time .
0.2057	He ran in the woods and climbed the hills and waded in the creek .
31.1767	He was much with his tooth thrall , for the king had said to Olaf : `` Be ever at his call . ''
0.7080	Now this Olaf was full of stories , and Harald liked to hear them .
59.6161	`` Come out to Aegir 's Rock , Olaf , and tell me stories , '' he said almost every day .
7.8697	So they started off across the hills .
10.0329	The man wore a long , loose coat of white wool , belted at the waist with a strap .
7.8239	He had on coarse shoes and leather leggings .
6.0208	Around his neck was an iron collar welded together so that it could not come off .
27.1910	On it were strange marks , called runes , that said : `` Olaf , thrall of Halfdan . ''
16.0399	But Harald 's clothes were gay .
6.9446	A cape of gray velvet hung from his shoulders .
5.6383	It was fastened over his breast with great gold buckles .
15.9308	When it waved in the wind , a scarlet lining flashed out , and the bottom of a little scarlet jacket showed .
5.9424	His feet and legs were covered with gray woolen tights .
3.2001	Gold lacings wound around his legs from his shoes to his knees .
3.9926	A band of gold held down his long , yellow hair .
6.8804	It was a wild country that these two were walking over .
8.4493	They were climbing steep , rough hills .
3.3213	Some of them seemed made all of rock , with a little earth lying in spots .
1.6233	Great rocks hung out from them , with trees growing in their cracks .
3.8363	Some big pieces had broken off and rolled down the hill .
16.4343	`` Thor broke them , '' Olaf said .
1.7083	`` He rides through the sky and hurls his hammer at clouds and at mountains .
3.8406	That makes the thunder and the lightning and cracks the hills .
14.2864	His hammer never misses its aim , and it always comes back to his hand and is eager to go again . ''
4.1785	When they reached the top of the hill they looked back .
7.9126	Far below was a soft , green valley .
1.5117	In front of it the sea came up into the land and made a fiord .
9.6432	On each side of the fiord high walls of rock stood up and made the water black with shadow .
3.0199	All around the valley were high hills with dark pines on them .
10.5303	Far off were the mountains .
8.9271	In the valley were Halfdan 's houses around their square yard .
6.8813	`` How little our houses look down there ! ''
19.7750	Harald said .
13.3841	`` But I can almost -- yes , I can see the red dragon on the roof of the feast hall .
4.5590	Do you remember when I climbed up and sat on his head , Olaf ? ''
6.0230	He laughed and kicked his heels and ran on .
3.0839	At last they came to Aegir 's Rock and walked up on its flat top .
12.1003	Harald went to the edge and looked over .
32.3658	A ragged wall of rock reached down , and two hundred feet below was the black water of the fiord .
21.4506	Olaf watched him for a while , then he said : `` No whitening of your cheek , Harald ?
11.7631	Good !
72.2270	A boy that can face the fall of Aegir 's Rock will not be afraid to face the war flash when he is a man . ''
8.9805	`` Ho , I am not afraid of the war flash now , '' cried Harald .
1.5610	He threw back his cape and drew a little dagger from his belt .
8.9804	`` See ! ''
4.4861	he cried ; `` does this not flash like a sword ?
8.6255	And I am not afraid .
5.1406	But after all , this is a baby thing !
23.0436	When I am eight years old I will have a sword , a sharp tooth of war . ''
4.1290	He swung his dagger as though it were a long sword .
9.4284	Then he ran and sat on a rock by Olaf .
9.9556	`` Why is this Aegir 's Rock ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
0.5346	`` You know that Asgard is up in the sky , '' Olaf said .
6.9780	`` It is a wonderful city where the golden houses of the gods are in the golden grove .
7.4359	A high wall runs all around it .
30.0495	In the house of Odin , the All-father , there is a great feast hall larger than the whole earth .
16.7846	Its name is Valhalla .
23.9879	It has five hundred doors .
10.1467	The rafters are spears .
9.1758	The roof is thatched with shields .
9.9252	Armor lies on the benches .
19.1143	In the high seat sits Odin , a golden helmet on his head , a spear in his hand .
17.2597	Two wolves lie at his feet .
50.1390	At his right hand and his left sit all the gods and goddesses , and around the hall sit thousands and thousands of men , all the brave ones that have ever died .
85.8265	`` Now it is good to be in Valhalla ; for there is mead there better than men can brew , and it never runs out .
3.3272	And there are skalds that sing wonderful songs that men never heard .
116.3752	And before the doors of Valhalla is a great meadow where the warriors fight every day and get glorious and sweet wounds and give many .
11.0145	And all night they feast , and their wounds heal .
0.4629	But none may go to Valhalla except warriors that have died bravely in battle .
0.4310	Men who die from sickness go with women and children and cowards to Niflheim .
29.6988	There Hela , who is queen , always sneers at them , and a terrible cold takes hold of their bones , and they sit down and freeze .
25.2297	`` Years ago Aegir was a great warrior .
25.9385	Aegir the Big-handed , they called him .
8.6512	In many a battle his sword had sung , and he had sent many warriors to Valhalla .
23.9591	Many swords had bit into his flesh and left marks there , but never a one had struck him to death .
6.8318	So his hair grew white and his arms thin .
14.2876	There was peace in that country then , and Aegir sorrowed , saying : '' ' I am old .
10.1507	Battles are still .
8.7881	Must I die in bed like a woman ?
18.2228	Shall I not see Valhalla ? '
352.0287	`` Now thus did Odin say long ago : '' ` If a man is old and is come near death and can not die in fight , let him find death in some brave way and he shall feast with me in Valhalla . '
12.6148	`` So one day Aegir came to this rock . '' '
16.6436	A deed to win Valhalla ! '
10.4282	he cried .
44.7978	`` Then he drew his sword and flashed it over his head and held his shield high above him , and leaped out into the air and died in the water of the fiord . ''
10.1391	`` Ho ! ''
15.3640	cried Harald , jumping to his feet .
67.2099	`` I think that Odin stood up before his high seat and welcomed that man gladly when he walked through the door of Valhalla . ''
43.0949	`` So the songs say , '' replied Olaf , `` for skalds still sing of that deed all over Norway . ''
4.0235	At another time Harald asked : `` What is your country , Olaf ?
8.1564	Have you always been a thrall ? ''
9.8164	The thrall 's eyes flashed .
94.4844	`` When you are a man , '' he said , `` and go a-viking to Denmark , ask men whether they ever heard of Olaf the Crafty .
2.7225	There , far off , is my country , across the water .
11.8572	My father was Gudbrand the Big .
7.7235	Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle .
2.7504	Ten sons sat at meat with him , and I was the youngest .
0.5545	One day he said : '' ` You are all grown to be men .
8.7153	There is not elbow-room here for so many chiefs .
3.9088	The eldest of you shall have my farm when I die .
9.4545	The rest of you , off a-viking ! '
15.6782	`` He had three ships .
11.1198	These he gave to three of my brothers .
9.1050	But I stayed that spring and built me a boat .
87.0477	I made her for only twenty oars because I thought few men would follow me ; for I was young , fifteen years old .
5.4137	I made her in the likeness of a dragon .
1.9307	At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out .
7.2069	I painted the eyes red for anger . ''
7.3863	` There , stand so ! '
2.6114	I said , ` and glare and hiss at my foes . '
1.8382	`` In the stern I curved the tail up almost as high as the head .
0.2059	There I put the pilot 's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder .
4.0143	On the breast and sides I carved the dragon 's scales .
3.0942	Then I painted it all black and on the tip of every scale I put gold .
10.8389	I called her ` Waverunner . '
1.6451	There she sat on the rollers , as fair a ship as I ever saw .
0.3570	`` The night that it was finished I went to my father 's feast .
297.6033	After the meats were eaten and the mead-horns came round , I stood up from my bench and raised my drinking-horn high and spoke with a great voice : '' ` This is my vow : I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches .
2.8082	Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land .
12.5006	Now who will follow me ? ' ''
3.0412	` He is but a boy , ' the men said .
2.8584	` He has opened his mouth wider than he can do . '
1.9075	`` But others jumped to their feet with their mead-horns in their hands .
126.1489	Thirty men , one after another , raised their horns and said : '' ' I will follow this lad , and I will not turn back so long as he and I live ! '
9.5326	`` On the next morning we got into my dragon and started .
6.8541	I sat high in the pilot 's seat .
15.1738	As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it : '' ` The dragon runs .
11.0989	Where will she steer ?
2.7227	Where swords will sing , Where spears will bite , Where I shall laugh . '
13.4807	`` So we harried the coast of Norway .
7.5621	We ate at many men 's tables uninvited .
8.3837	Many men we found overburdened with gold .
10.9794	Then I said : '' ` My dragon 's belly is never full , ' and on board went the gold .
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.2557	it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals .
4.3733	A house smells of smoke , a ship smells of frolic .
3.1534	From a house you see a sooty roof , from a ship you see Valhalla .
1.9174	`` Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic .
7.4556	After a while my men said : '' ` What of the farm , Olaf ? ' ''
7.5370	` Not yet , ' I answered .
16.6534	` Viking is better for summer .
13.6131	When the ice comes , and our dragon can not play , then we will get our farm and sit down . '
25.0957	`` At last the winter came , and I said to my men : '' ` Now for the farm .
12.8623	I have my eye on one up the coast a way in King Halfdan 's country . '
6.8528	`` So we set off for it .
14.1673	We landed late at night and pulled our boat up on shore and walked quietly to the house .
16.8615	It was rather a wealthy farm , for there were stables and a storehouse and a smithy at the sides of the house .
11.4771	There was but one door to the house .
1.1963	We went to it , and I struck it with my spear . ''
9.2169	` Hello !
11.7281	Ho !
9.2169	Hello ! '
4.7930	I shouted , and my men made a great din .
6.2407	`` At last some one from inside said : '' ` Who calls ? ' '' '
7.2971	I call , ' I answered .
18.4339	` Open !
39.4831	or you will think it Thor who calls , ' and I struck my shield against the door so that it made a great clanging .
6.3918	`` The door opened only a little , but I pushed it wide and leaped into the room .
3.3276	It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth .
14.9214	I stood with my back to the wall ; for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me . ''
6.1077	` Now start up the fire , ' I said . ''
7.9040	` Come , come ! '
12.2593	I called , when no one obeyed . '
10.3342	A fire !
7.0775	This is cold welcome for your guests . '
8.4392	`` My men laughed . ''
8.3182	` Yes , a stingy host !
4.6957	He acts as though he had not expected us . '
3.1634	`` But now the farmer was blowing on the coals and putting on fresh wood .
3.5227	Soon it blazed up , and we could see about us .
3.0151	We were in a little feast hall , with its fire down the middle of it .
11.7318	There were benches for twenty men along each side .
5.4711	The farmer crouched by the fire , afraid to move .
0.4630	On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together . ''
12.5953	` Ho , thralls ! '
8.1446	I called to them .
8.5163	` Bring in the table .
9.0792	We are hungry . '
1.5108	`` Off they ran through a door at the back of the hall .
37.1723	My men came in and lay down by the fire and warmed themselves , but I set two of them as guards at the door . ''
6.1164	` Well , friend farmer , ' laughed one , ` why such a long face ?
4.0893	Do you not think we shall be merry company ? ' ''
3.2872	` We came only to cheer you , ' said another .
2.6484	` What man wants to spend the winter with no guests ? ' ''
8.4583	` Ah ! '
7.3275	another then cried out , sitting up .
0.2217	` Here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach . '
4.0299	`` The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat .
21.3800	They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it , and we sat and watched it boil while we joked .
9.6137	At last the supper began .
74.1694	The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat , and you can not wonder ; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket-loads of bread into our big mouths .
44.6479	When the tables were taken out and the mead-horns came round , I stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer : '' ` You would not eat with us .
4.2725	You can not say no to half of my ale .
6.6877	I drink this to your health . '
8.0667	`` Then I drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer .
9.4395	He took it and smiled , saying : '' ` Since it is to my health , I will drink it .
0.4980	I thought that all this night 's work would be my death . ' ''
6.1425	` Oh , do not fear that ! '
2.8029	I laughed , ` for a dead man sets no tables . '
7.1745	`` So we drank and all grew merrier .
11.5070	At last I stood up and said : '' ' I like this little taste of your hospitality , friend farmer .
5.3301	I have decided to accept more of it . '
8.7449	`` My men roared with laughter . ''
0.1758	` Come , ' they cried , ` thank him for that , farmer .
5.6950	Did you ever have such a lordly guest before ? '
36.3344	`` I went on : '' ` Now there is no fun in having guests unless they keep you company and make you merry .
3.2670	So I will give out this law : that my men shall never leave you alone .
11.0362	Hakon there shall be your constant companion , friend farmer .
17.2335	He shall not leave you day or night , whether you are working or playing or sleeping .
4.5341	Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons . '
16.7430	`` I named nine others and said : '' ` And these shall follow your thralls in the same way .
4.4757	Now , am I not careful to make your time go merrily ? '
7.4252	`` So I set guards over every one in that house .
5.2915	Not once all that winter did they stir out of sight of some of us .
6.9253	So no tales got out to the neighbors .
9.1389	Besides , it was a lonely place , and by good luck no one came that way .
9.9755	Oh !
8.8850	that was fat and easy living .
156.0064	`` Well , after we had been there for a long time , Hakon came in to the feast one night and said : '' ' I heard a cuckoo to-day ! ' ''
3.2832	` It is the call to go a-viking , ' I said .
2.4992	`` All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted .
10.5085	Their eyes danced .
10.5843	Big Thorleif stood up and stretched himself . '' '
3.8273	I am stiff with long sitting , ' he said . '
8.5972	I itch for a fight . '
6.6100	`` I turned to the farmer . ''
1.1952	` This is our last feast with you , ' I said . ''
20.9714	` Well , ' he laughed , ` this has been the busiest winter I ever spent , and the merriest .
13.1589	May good luck go with you ! ' ''
13.8007	` By the beard of Odin ! '
1.3218	I cried ; ` you have taken our joke like a man . '
4.8314	`` My men pounded the table with their fists . ''
7.6877	` By the hammer of Thor ! '
11.9846	shouted Grim .
9.2578	` Here is no stingy coward .
11.6030	He is a man fit to carry my drinking-horn , the horn of a sea-rover and a sword-swinger .
4.0798	Here , friend , take it , ' and he thrust it into the farmer 's hand .
3.0828	` May you drink heart 's - ease from it for many years .
2.6062	And with it I leave you a name , Sif the Friendly .
8.2707	I shall hope to drink with you sometime in Valhalla . '
168.0046	`` Then all my men poured around that farmer and clapped him on the shoulder and piled things upon him , saying : '' ` Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly . ' ''
5.1200	` And here is a bracelet . ' '' '
2.9348	A sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side . '
8.7577	`` I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him .
11.3471	`` The old man 's eyes opened wide at all these things , and at the same time he laughed . ''
23.3911	` May Odin send me such guests every winter ! '
9.8387	he said .
61.9752	`` Early next morning we shook hands with our host and boarded the ` Waverunner ' and sailed off . ''
8.8530	` Where shall we go ? '
9.0392	my men asked . ''
1.4360	` Let the gods decide , ' I said , and tossed up my spear .
6.2958	`` When it fell on the deck it pointed up-shore , so I steered in that direction .
37.2605	That is the best way to decide , for the spear will always point somewhere , and one thing is as good as another .
5.4981	That time it pointed us into your father 's ships .
8.9682	They closed in battle with us and killed my men and sunk my ship and dragged me off a prisoner .
14.3218	They were three against one , or they might have tasted something more bitter at our hands .
13.2912	They took me before King Halfdan . ''
5.1172	` Here , ' they said , ` is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts .
2.3108	We sunk his ship and men , but him we brought to you . ' '' '
10.8561	A robber viking ? '
6.4066	said the king , and scowled at me .
5.2789	`` I threw back my head and laughed . ''
9.2169	` Yes .
0.5863	And with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me . '
8.0085	`` The king frowned more angrily . ''
11.3086	` Saucy , too ? '
9.8387	he said .
8.0815	` Well , thieves must die .
2.5871	Take him out , Thorkel , and let him taste your sword . '
4.2882	`` Your mother , the queen , was standing by .
17.0740	Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said : '' ` He is only a lad .
10.2464	Let him live .
3.1841	And would he not be a good gift for our baby ? '
1.5563	`` Your father thought a moment , then looked at your mother and smiled . ''
9.9117	` Soft heart ! '
14.4070	he said gently to her ; then to Thorkel , ` Well , let him go , Thorkel ! '
4.7389	`` Then he turned to me again , frowning . ''
55.5437	` But , young sharp-tongue , now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you can not get out of .
7.4304	Weld an iron collar on his neck . '
9.9226	`` So I lived and now am your tooth thrall .
6.5174	Well , it is the luck of war .
4.8766	But by the chair of Odin , I kept my vow ! ''
8.4583	`` Yes ! ''
15.3640	cried Harald , jumping to his feet .
6.4228	`` And had a joke into the bargain .
11.9894	Ah !
5.3593	sometime I will make a brave vow like that . ''
0.5138	At another time Harald said : `` Tell me of a fight , Olaf .
5.0316	I want to hear about the music of swords . ''
19.5136	Olaf 's eyes blazed .
3.7605	`` I will tell you of our fight with King Havard , '' he said .
19.8065	`` One dark night we had landed at a farm .
3.7647	We left our ` Waverunner ' in the water with three men to guard her .
6.3270	The rest of us went into the house .
2.8697	The farmer met us at the door , but he died by Thorkel 's sword .
7.6176	The others we shut into their beds .
11.0166	The door at each end of the hall we had barred on the inside so that nobody could surprise us .
1.8839	We were busy going through the cupboards and shouting at our good luck .
0.3942	But suddenly we heard a shout outside : '' ` Thor and Havard ! '
3.6747	`` Then there was a great beating at the doors . ''
64.5539	` He has two hundred fighters with him , ' said Grim ; ` for we saw his ships last night .
33.9856	Thirty against two hundred !
11.4776	We shall all drink in Valhalla to-night . ' ''
5.7112	` Well , ' I cried , ` Odin shall have no unwilling guest in me . ' ''
9.5070	` Nor in me , ' cried Hakon . ''
6.5658	` Nor in me , ' shouted Thorkel .
8.6143	`` And that shout went all around , and we drew out our swords and caught up our shields . ''
6.8789	` Hot work is ahead of us , ' said Hakon .
5.5949	` Besides , we must leave none of this mead for Havard .
13.3147	Lend a hand , some one . '
9.5660	`` Then he and another pulled out a great tub that sat on the floor of the cupboard . '' '
28.7968	I drink to Valhalla to-night , ' cried Thorkel the Thirsty , and he plunged his horn deep into the tub .
13.1778	`` When he brought it up , his sleeve was dripping and the sweet mead was running over from the horn . ''
17.6910	` Sloven ! '
13.0236	cried Hakon , and he struck Thorkel with his fist and knocked him over into the cupboard .
8.8874	`` He fell against the wooden wall at the back , and a carved panel swung open behind him .
17.0858	He dropped down head first .
8.3988	In a minute he put his head out of the hole again .
7.8375	We all stood staring . '' '
2.3983	I think it is a secret passage , ' he said . ''
2.3976	` We will try it , ' I answered in a whisper .
8.7272	` Throw dirt on the fire .
8.5438	It must be dark . '
0.2236	`` So we dug up dirt from the earth floor and smothered the fire .
19.0410	All this time there was a terrible shouting and hammering at the doors , but they were of heavy logs and stood . '' '
12.2588	I with four more will guard this door , ' I said , pointing to the east end .
11.1339	`` Immediately four men stepped to my side . ''
14.3815	` And I will guard the other , ' Hakon said , and four went with him . ''
4.8544	` The rest of you , down the hole ! '
9.8387	I said .
7.9649	` Close the door after you .
3.9729	If luck is with us we will meet at the ships .
18.9116	Now Thor and our good swords help us !
12.0412	Quick !
7.8821	The doors are giving way . '
5.7533	`` So we ten men stood at the doors and held back the king 's soldiers .
11.4098	It was dark in the room , and the people out of doors could not tell how many were inside .
11.2051	Few were eager to be the first in . ''
34.2003	` Thirty swords are waiting in there to eat up the first man , ' we heard some one say .
8.4575	`` We chuckled at that .
3.8648	`` But the king stood in the very doorway and fought .
32.1398	Our five swords held him back for a long time , but at last he pushed in , and his men poured after him .
3.0480	We ran back and hid behind some tubs in a dark corner .
2.9735	The king 's men went groping about and calling , but they did not find us .
28.8001	The room was full of shouting and running and sword-clashing ; for in the dark and the noise the men could not tell their own soldiers .
12.3956	More than one fell by his friend 's sword .
9.4309	When it was less crowded about the doorway , I whispered : '' ` Follow me in double line .
7.7310	We will make for the ships .
10.3276	Keep close together . '
11.2062	`` So that double line of men , with swords swinging from both sides , ran out through the dark .
4.7559	Swords struck out at us , and we struck back .
0.2004	Men ran after us shouting , but our legs were as good as theirs .
3.5182	But I and Hakon and one other were all that reached the ship .
4.2034	There we saw our ` Waverunner ' with sail up and bow pointing to open sea .
6.6297	We swam out to her and climbed aboard .
0.2027	Then the men swung the sail to the wind , and we moved off .
59.1613	Even as we went , a spear whizzed through the air , and Hakon fell dead ; for the king and all his men were running to the shore . ''
8.5295	` After them ! '
9.6954	they were shouting .
28.2744	`` Then we heard the king call to the men in his boats lying out in the water : '' ` Row to shore and take us in . '
7.8347	`` Thorkel was standing by my side .
1.3150	At that he laughed and said : '' ` They do not answer .
5.8366	He left but a handful to guard his ships .
9.8102	They tasted our swords .
1.6471	And we went aboard and broke the oars and threw the sails into the water .
12.4395	It will be slow going for Havard to-night . '
56.2368	`` Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly : '' ` King Havard 's ships are dead : Olaf 's dragon flies .
17.0366	King Havard stamps the shore : Olaf skims the waves .
18.9984	King Havard shakes his fist .
17.1718	Olaf turns and laughs . '
6.6094	`` That was the end of our meeting with King Havard . ''
725.2905	Every day the boy Harald heard some such story of war or of the gods , until he could see Thor riding among the storm-clouds and throwing his hammer , until he knew that a brave man has many wounds , but never a one on his back .
63.5591	Many nights he dreamed that he himself walked into Valhalla , and that all the heroes stood up and shouted : `` Welcome !
29.2726	Harald Halfdanson ! ''
9.2169	`` Ah !
50.3038	the bite of the sword is sweeter than the kiss of your mother , '' he said to Olaf one day .
4.1763	`` When shall I stand in the prow of a dragon and feast on the fight ?
7.5142	I am hungry to see the world .
7.2518	Ivar the Far-goer tells me of the strange countries he has seen .
11.9894	Ah !
9.8543	we vikings are great folk .
2.7286	There is no water that has not licked our boats ' sides .
8.5892	This cape of mine came in a viking boat from France .
16.6031	These cloak-pins came from a far country called Greece .
7.6901	In my father 's house are golden cups from Rome , away on the southern sea .
10.2393	Every land pours rich things into our treasure-chest .
5.8370	Ivar has been to a strange country where it is all sand and is very hot .
8.3442	The people call their country Arabia .
13.2887	They have never heard of Thor or Odin .
3.7581	Ivar brought beautiful striped cloth from there , and wonderful , sweet-smelling waters .
9.9755	Oh !
9.0048	when shall the white horses of the sea lead me out to strange lands and glorious battles ? ''
14.9867	But Harald did something besides listen to stories .
17.3917	Every morning he was up at sunrise and went with a thrall to feed the hunting dogs .
5.8667	Thorstein taught him to swim in the rough waters of the fiord .
23.6907	Often he went with the men a-hunting in the woods and learned to ride a horse and pull a bow and throw a lance .
5.0129	Ivar taught him to play the harp and to make up songs .
21.0786	He went much to the smithy , where the warriors mended their helmets and made their spears and swords of iron and bronze .
130.5428	At first he only watched the men or worked the bellows , but soon he could handle the tongs and hold the red-hot iron , and after a long time he learned to use the hammer and to shape metal .
25.8752	One day he made himself a spear-head .
11.3494	It was two feet long and sharp on both edges .
4.1894	While the iron was hot he beat into it some runes .
46.5515	When the men in the smithy saw the runes they opened their eyes wide and looked at the boy , for few Norsemen could read .
7.6365	`` What does it say ? ''
10.1128	they asked .
24.3777	`` It is the name of my spear-point , and it says , ` Foes ' - fear , ' '' Harald said .
13.1456	`` But now for a handle . ''
10.9356	It was winter and the snow was very deep .
6.7567	So Harald put on his skees and started for a wood that was back from shore .
53.1069	Down the mountains he went , twenty , thirty feet at a slide , leaping over chasms a hundred feet across .
4.3435	In his scarlet cloak he looked like a flash of fire .
18.6746	The wind shot past him howling .
8.8458	His eyes danced at the fun .
3.4918	`` It is like flying , '' he thought and laughed .
7.9506	`` I am an eagle .
6.2618	Now I soar , '' as he leaped over a frozen river .
3.1892	He saw a slender ash growing on top of a high rock .
2.7168	`` That is the handle for ` Foes ' - fear , ' '' he said .
8.5843	The rock stood up like a ragged tower , but he did not stop because of the steep climb .
9.6380	He threw off his skees and thrust his hands and feet into holes of the rock and drew himself up .
23.5033	He tore his jacket and cut his leather leggings and scratched his face and bruised his hands , but at last he was on the top .
37.0818	Soon he had chopped down the tree and had cut a straight pole ten feet long and as big around as his arm .
0.2274	He went down , sliding and jumping and tearing himself on the sharp stones .
6.7009	With a last leap he landed near his skees .
0.2307	As he did so a lean wolf jumped and snapped at him , snarling .
17.3835	Harald shouted and swung his pole .
7.3676	The wolf dodged , but quickly jumped again and caught the boy 's arm between his sharp teeth .
13.6714	Harald thought of the spear-point in his belt .
2.3653	In a wink he had it out and was striking with it .
4.6947	He drove it into the wolf 's neck and threw him back on the snow , dead .
59.3854	`` You are the first to feel the tooth of ` Foes ' - fear , ' '' he said , `` but I think you will not be the last . ''
3.7981	Then without thinking of his torn arm he put on his skees and went leaping home .
8.7521	He went straight to the smithy and smoothed his pole and drove it into the haft of the spear-point .
1.5199	He hammered out a gold band and put it around the joining place .
1.7468	He made nails with beautiful heads and drove them into the pole in different places .
1.4639	`` If it is heavy it will strike hard , '' he said .
14.5353	Then he weighed the spear in his hand and found the balancing point and put another gold band there to mark it .
15.0488	Thorstein came in while he was working .
6.5629	`` A good spear , '' he said .
4.4849	Then he saw the torn sleeve and the red wound beneath .
8.4583	`` Hello ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
16.4958	`` Your first wound ? ''
6.3406	`` Oh , it is only a wolf-scratch , '' Harald answered .
9.6525	`` By Thor ! ''
3.7791	cried Thorstein , `` I see that you are ready for better wounds .
7.1121	You bear this like a warrior . ''
2.5688	`` I think it will not be my last , '' Harald said .
1.3665	Now when Harald was ten years old his father , King Halfdan , died .
60.9262	An old book that tells about Harald says that then `` he was the biggest of all men , the strongest , and the fairest to look upon . ''
29.3037	That about a boy ten years old !
80.8198	But boys grew fast in those days for they were out of doors all the time , running , swimming , leaping on skees , and hunting in the forest .
9.0205	All that makes big , manly boys .
5.7947	So now King Halfdan was dead and buried , and Harald was to be king .
10.2748	But first he must drink his father 's funeral ale .
8.0829	`` Take down the gay tapestries that hang in the feast hall , '' he said to the thralls .
8.1434	`` Put up black and gray ones .
10.0423	Strew the floor with pine branches .
16.5942	Brew twenty tubs of fresh ale and mead .
8.2642	Scour every dish until it shines . ''
3.0354	Then Harald sent messengers all over that country to his kinsmen and friends .
28.3306	`` Bid them come in three months ' time to drink my father 's funeral ale , '' he said .
8.3434	`` Tell them that no one shall go away empty-handed . ''
18.5367	So in three months men came riding up at every hour .
9.3761	Some came in boats .
22.6928	But many had ridden far through mountains , swimming rivers ; for there were few roads or bridges in Norway .
2.9220	On account of that hard ride no women came to the feast .
21.5373	At nine o'clock in the night the feast began .
2.9109	The men came walking in at the west end of the hall .
0.2400	The great bonfires down the middle of the room were flashing light on everything .
11.8307	The clean smell of this wood-smoke and of the pine branches on the floor was pleasant to the guests .
25.0522	Down each side of the hall stretched long , backless benches , with room for three hundred men .
7.8996	In the middle of each side rose the high seat , a great carved chair on a platform .
4.5862	All along behind the benches were the black and gray draperies .
41.7524	Here hung the shields of the guests ; for every man , when he was given his place , turned and hung his shield behind him and set his tall spear by it .
29.8597	So on each wall there was a long row of gay shields , red and green and yellow , and all shining with gold or bronze trimmings .
5.8797	And higher up there was another row of gleaming spear-points .
32.5693	Above the hall the rafters were carved and gaily painted , so that dragons seemed to be crawling across , or eagles seemed to be swooping down .
3.8369	The guests walked in laughing and talking with their big voices so that the rafters rang .
80.6760	They made the hall look all the brighter with their clothes of scarlet and blue and green , with their flashing golden bracelets and head-bands and sword-scabbards , with their flying hair of red or yellow .
5.8090	Across the east end of the hall was a bench .
75.3806	When the men were all in , the queen , Harald 's mother , and the women who lived with her , walked in through the east door and sat upon this bench .
0.2293	Then thralls came running in and set up the long tables before the benches .
6.1785	Other thralls ran in with large steaming kettles of meat .
4.9989	They put big pieces of this meat into platters of wood and set it before the men .
7.6386	They had a few dishes of silver .
17.1711	These they put before the guests at the middle of the tables ; for the great people sat here near the high seats .
128.0736	When the meat came , the talking stopped ; for Norsemen ate only twice a day , and these men had had long rides and were hungry .
19.9377	Three or four persons ate from one platter and drank from the same big bowl of milk .
15.3473	They had no forks , so they ate from their fingers and threw the bones under the table among the pine branches .
4.1664	Sometimes they took knives from their belts to cut the meat .
16.7891	When the guests sat back satisfied , Harald called to the thralls : `` Carry out the tables . ''
29.2285	So they did and brought in two great tubs of mead and set one at each end of the hall .
3.8533	Then the queen stood up and called some of her women .
8.5670	They went to the mead tubs .
13.2208	They took the horns , when the thralls had filled them , and carried them to the men with some merry word .
31.6405	Perhaps one woman said as she handed a man his horn : `` This horn has no feet to be set down upon .
13.2156	You must drink it at one draught . ''
8.0561	Perhaps another said : `` Mead loves a merry face . ''
6.1102	The women were beautiful , moving about the hall .
2.0006	The queen wore a trailing dress of blue velvet with long flowing sleeves .
3.8088	She had a short apron of striped Arabian silk with gold fringe along the bottom .
2.2325	From her shoulders hung a long train of scarlet wool embroidered in gold .
10.0853	White linen covered her head .
17.5365	Her long yellow hair was pulled around at the sides and over her breast and was fastened under the belt of her apron .
0.2421	As she walked , her train made a pleasant rustle among the pine branches .
7.7396	She was tall and straight and strong .
17.4363	Some of her younger women wore no linen on their heads and had their white arms bare , with bracelets shining on them .
6.5275	They , too , were tall and strong .
16.4066	All the time men were calling across the fire to one another asking news or telling jokes and laughing .
9.3536	An old man , Harald 's uncle , sat in the high seat on the north side .
7.6805	That was the place of honor .
6.1628	But the high seat on the south side was empty ; for that was the king 's seat .
14.7653	Harald sat on the steps before it .
15.6118	The feast went merrily until long after midnight .
25.6944	Then the thralls took some of the guests to the guest house to sleep , and some to the beds around the sides of the feast hall .
0.1925	But some men lay down on the benches and drew their cloaks over themselves .
23.2970	On the next night there was another feast .
10.4770	Still Harald sat on the step before the high seat .
682.2517	But when the tables were gone and the horns were going around , he stood up and raised high a horn of ale and said loudly : `` This horn of memory I drink in honor of my father , Halfdan , son of Gudrod , who sits now in Valhalla .
1.9595	And I vow that I will grind my father 's foes under my heel . ''
76.6457	Then he drank the ale and sat down in the king 's high seat , while all the men stood up and raised their horns and shouted : `` King Harald ! ''
3.6621	And some cried : `` That was a brave vow . ''
0.4795	And Harald 's uncle called out : `` A health to King Harald ! ''
7.8182	And they all drank it .
6.1216	Then a man stood up and said : `` Hear my song of King Halfdan ! ''
8.1883	for this man was a skald .
6.8998	`` Yes , the song ! ''
11.5592	shouted the men , and Harald nodded his head .
16.7335	So the skald took down his great harp from the wall behind him and went and stood before Harald .
12.7019	The bottom of the harp rested on the floor , but the top reached as high as the skald 's shoulders .
8.9485	The brass frame shone in the light .
4.4139	The strings were some of gold and some of silver .
91.0936	The man struck them with his hand and sang of King Halfdan , of his battles , of his strong arm and good sword , of his death , and of how men loved him .
66.4320	When he had finished , King Harald took a bracelet from his arm and gave it to him , saying : `` Take this as thanks for your good song . ''
6.4788	The guests stayed the next day and at night there was another feast .
101.2212	When the mead horns were going around , King Harald stood up and spoke : `` I said that no man should go away empty-handed from drinking my father 's funeral ale . ''
11.8061	He beckoned the thralls , and they brought in a great treasure-chest and set it down by the high seat .
38.4738	King Harald opened it and took out rich gifts -- capes and sword-belts and beautiful cloth and bracelets and gold cloak-pins .
2.5047	These he sent about the hall and gave something to every man .
6.3215	The guests wondered at the richness of his gifts .
7.4354	`` This young king has an open hand , '' they said , `` and deep treasure-chests . ''
201.1430	After breakfast the next morning the guests went out and stood by their horses ready to go , but before they mounted , thralls brought a horn of mead to each man .
29.1454	That was called the stirrup-horn , because after they drank it the men put their feet to the stirrups and sprang upon their horses and started .
7.2393	King Harald and his people rode a little way with them .
0.2321	All men said that that was the richest funeral feast that ever was held .
25.1111	Now King Halfdan had many foes .
9.0193	When he was alive they were afraid to make war upon him , for he was a mighty warrior .
2.7425	But when Harald became king , they said : `` He is but a lad .
4.2657	We will fight with him and take his land . ''
8.9310	So they began to make ready .
2.7701	King Harald heard of this and he laughed and said : `` Good !
6.6460	` Foes ' - fear ' is thirsty , and my legs are stiff with much sitting . ''
14.0942	He called three men to him .
5.8318	To one he gave an arrow , saying : `` Run and carry this arrow north .
157.6219	Give it into the hands of the master of the next farm , and say that all men are to meet here within two weeks from this day .
5.9125	They must come ready for war and mounted on horses .
95.2221	Say also that if a man does not obey this call , or if he receives this arrow and does not carry it on to his next neighbor , he shall be outlawed from this country , and his land shall be taken from him . ''
20.0586	He gave arrows to the other two men and told them to run south and east with the same message .
20.3966	So all through King Harald 's country men were soon busy mending helmets and polishing swords and making shields .
1.6465	There was blazing of forges and clanging of anvils all through the land .
24.5732	On the day set , the fields about King Harald 's house were full of men and horses .
10.2232	After breakfast a horn blew .
5.2750	Every man snatched his weapons and jumped upon his horse .
1.4965	Men of the same neighborhood stood together , and their chief led them .
8.6707	They waited for the starting horn .
7.6036	This did not look like our army .
8.7958	There were no uniforms .
6.7272	Some men wore helmets , some did not .
5.6561	Some wore coats of mail , but others wore only their jackets and tights of bright-colored wool .
4.1789	But at each man 's left side hung a great shield .
4.4733	Over his right shoulder went his sword-belt and held his long sword under his left hand .
3.2056	Above most men 's heads shone the points of their tall spears .
7.8489	Some men carried axes in their belts .
9.4438	Some carried bows and arrows .
6.7128	Many had ram 's horns hanging from their necks .
0.4223	King Harald rode at the front of his army with his standard-bearer beside him .
12.0218	Chain-armor covered the king 's body .
7.4396	A red cloak was thrown over his shoulders .
0.2356	On his head was a gold helmet with a dragon standing up from it .
6.5212	He carried a round shield on his left arm .
7.3831	The king had made that shield himself .
8.9308	It was of brass .
5.6825	The rivets were of silver , with strangely shaped heads .
12.3846	On the back of Harald 's horse was a red cloth trimmed with the fur of ermine .
10.3623	King Harald looked up at his standard and laughed aloud .
10.8585	`` Oh , War-lover , '' he cried , `` you and I ride out on a gay journey . ''
7.1641	A horn blew again and the army started .
1.5636	The men shouted as they went , and blew their ram 's horns .
23.7181	`` Now we shall taste something better than even King Harald 's ale , '' shouted one .
6.0218	Another rose in his stirrups and sniffed the air .
9.2169	`` Ah !
6.3886	I smell a battle , '' he cried .
4.2074	`` It is sweeter than those strange waters of Arabia . ''
7.7218	So the army went merrily through the land .
4.8227	They carried no tents , they had no provision wagons .
5.7272	`` The sky is a good enough tent for a soldier , '' said the Norsemen .
2.2559	`` Why carry provisions when they lie in the farms beside you ? ''
14.3186	After two days King Harald saw another army on the hills .
39.5483	`` Thorstein , '' he shouted , `` up with the white shield and go tell King Haki to choose his battle-field .
22.1069	We will wait but an hour .
7.9082	I am eager for the frolic . ''
22.0203	So Thorstein raised a white shield on his spear as a sign that he came on an errand of peace .
56.7726	He rode near King Haki , but he could not wait until he came close before he shouted out his message and then turned and rode back .
14.6450	`` Tell your boy king that we will not hang back , '' Haki called after Thorstein .
6.4568	King Harald 's men waited on the hillside and watched the other army across the valley .
0.6276	They saw King Haki point and saw twenty men ride off as he pointed .
2.8649	They stopped in a patch of hazel and hewed with their axes .
9.5751	`` They are getting the hazels , '' said Thorstein .
45.4522	`` Audun , '' said King Harald to a man near him , `` stay close to my standard all day .
6.5429	You must see the best of the fight .
1.4653	I want to hear a song about it after it is over . ''
10.2373	This Audun was the skald who sang at the drinking of King Halfdan 's funeral ale .
12.4688	King Haki 's men rode down into the valley .
5.9074	They drove down stakes all about a great field .
4.1161	They tied the hazel twigs to the stakes in a string .
17.2667	But they left an open space toward King Harald 's army and one toward King Haki 's .
6.1799	Then a man raised a white shield and galloped toward King Harald .
8.0379	`` We are ready ! ''
10.4674	he shouted .
10.4551	At the same time King Haki raised a red shield .
0.4076	King Harald 's men put their shields before their mouths and shouted into them .
9.4536	It made a great roaring war-cry .
7.7222	`` Up with the war shield ! ''
20.8167	shouted King Harald .
9.6564	`` Horns blow ! ''
5.8900	There was a blowing of horns on both sides .
8.2237	The two armies galloped down into the field and ran together .
9.3649	The fight had begun .
52.4170	All that day long swords were flashing , spears flying , men shouting , men falling from their horses , swords clashing against shields .
15.3971	`` Victory flashes from that dragon , '' Harald 's men said , pointing to the king 's helmet .
12.8789	`` No one stands before it . ''
27.5082	And , surely , before night came , King Haki fell dead under `` Foes ' - fear . ''
6.4341	When he fell , a great shout went up from his warriors , and they turned and fled .
8.9366	King Harald 's men chased them far , but during the night came back to camp .
0.2994	Many brought swords and helmets and bracelets or silver-trimmed saddles and bridles with them .
1.3533	`` Here is what we got from the foe , '' they said .
59.3526	The next morning King Harald spoke to his men : `` Let us go about and find our dead . ''
8.1431	So they went over all the battle-field .
2.9109	They put every man on his shield and carried him and laid him on a hill-top .
0.2095	They hung his sword over his shoulder and laid his spear by his side .
4.5691	So they laid all the dead together there on the hill-top .
5.9318	Then King Harald said , looking about : `` This is a good place to lie .
8.7673	It looks far over the country .
7.1709	The sound of the sea reaches it .
10.5415	The wind sweeps here .
15.5500	It is a good grave for Norsemen and Vikings .
8.9216	But it is a long road and a rough road to Valhalla that these men must travel .
2.2569	Let the nearest kinsman of each man come and tie on his hell-shoes .
1.7758	Tie them fast , for they will need them much on that hard road . ''
5.8411	So friends tied shoes on the dead men 's feet .
4.5122	Then King Harald said : `` Now let us make the mound . ''
25.7581	Every man set to work with what tools he had and heaped earth over the dead until a great mound stood up .
8.8176	They piled stones on the top .
5.3444	On one of these stones King Harald made runes telling how these men had died .
10.7989	After that was done King Harald said : `` Now set up the pole , Thorstein .
1.6393	Let every man bring to that pole all that he took from the foe . ''
0.1897	So they did , and there was a great hill of things around it .
18.1238	Harald divided it into piles .
7.9729	`` This pile we will give to Thor in thanks for the victory , '' he said .
6.0094	`` This pile is mine because I am king .
8.8770	Here are the piles for the chiefs , and these things go to the other men of the army . ''
83.1862	So every man went away from that battle richer than he was before , and Thor looked down from Valhalla upon his full temple and was pleased .
39.5122	The next morning King Harald led his army back .
8.8326	But on the way he met other foes and had many battles and did not lose one .
2.8111	The kings either died in battle or ran away , and Harald had their lands .
13.0381	`` He has kept his vow , '' men said , `` and ground his father 's foes under his heel . ''
12.7474	So King Harald sat in peace for a while .
6.6283	Now Harald heard men talk of Gyda , the daughter of King Eric .
5.5664	`` She is very beautiful , '' they said , `` but she is very proud , too .
7.3231	She can both read and make runes .
0.2166	No other woman in the world knows so much about herbs as she does .
9.1766	She can cure any sickness .
5.6256	And she is proud of all this ! ''
12.8857	Now when King Harald heard that , he thought to himself : `` Fair and proud .
8.6284	I like them both .
5.7552	I will have her for my wife . ''
99.8196	So he called his uncle , Guthorm , and said : `` Take rich gifts and go to Gyda 's foster-father and tell him that I will marry Gyda . ''
14.2787	So Guthorm and his men came to that house and they told the king 's message to the foster-father .
15.1639	Gyda was standing near , weaving a rich cloak .
9.4025	She heard the speech .
28.6335	She came up and said , holding her head high and curling her lip : `` I will not waste myself on a king of so few people .
17.1759	Norway is a strange country .
4.9421	There is a little king here and a little king there -- hundreds of them scattered about .
5.5247	Now in Denmark there is but one great king over the whole land .
14.1118	And it is so in Sweden .
7.8458	Is no one brave enough to make all of Norway his own ? ''
7.9419	She laughed a scornful laugh and walked away .
5.2571	The men stood with open mouths and stared after her .
5.7174	Could it be that she had sent that saucy message to King Harald ?
9.1692	They looked at her foster-father .
3.6854	He was chuckling in his beard and said nothing to them .
7.0095	They started out of the house in anger .
271.1986	When they were at the door , Gyda came up to them again and said : `` Give this message to your King Harald for me : I will not be his wife unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake . ''
7.3388	So Guthorm and his men rode homeward across the country .
9.5365	They did not talk .
8.8485	They were all thinking .
9.1922	At last one said : `` How shall we give this message to the king ? ''
15.4635	`` I have been thinking of that , '' Guthorm said ; `` his anger is no little thing . ''
49.0788	It was late when they rode into the king 's yard ; for they had ridden slowly , trying to make some plan for softening the message , but they had thought of none .
11.4739	`` I see light through the wind 's - eyes of the feast hall , '' one said .
6.5915	`` Yes , the king keeps feast , '' Guthorm said .
3.5037	`` We must give our message before all his guests . ''
7.7248	So they went in with very heavy hearts .
13.5885	There sat King Harald in the high seat .
6.0747	The benches on both sides were full of men .
1.8099	The tables had been taken out , and the mead-horns were going round .
8.1606	`` Oh , ho ! ''
20.7449	cried King Harald .
9.9478	`` Our messengers !
9.9198	What news ? ''
10.0739	Then Guthorm said : `` This Gyda is a bold and saucy girl , King Harald .
6.7429	My tongue refuses to give her message . ''
9.2706	The king stamped his foot .
8.8240	`` Out with it ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
7.6365	`` What does she say ? ''
4.3415	`` She says that she will not marry so little a king , '' Guthorm answered .
17.2328	Harald jumped to his feet .
10.7258	His face flushed red .
17.0350	Guthorm stretched out his hand .
7.0007	`` They are not my words , O King ; they are the words of a silly girl . ''
7.3861	`` Is there any more ? ''
10.2741	the king shouted .
8.6083	`` Go on ! ''
11.8104	`` She said : ` There is one king in Denmark and one king in Sweden .
5.8171	Is there no man brave enough to make himself king of all Norway ?
52.4179	Tell King Harald that I will not marry him unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake . ' ''
15.5096	The guests sat speechless , staring at Guthorm .
8.1102	All at once the king broke into a roar of laughter .
7.6877	`` By the hammer of Thor ! ''
5.5330	he cried , `` that is a good message .
9.2016	I thank you , Gyda .
8.9189	Did you hear it , friends ?
17.8902	King of all Norway !
8.5011	Why , we are all stupids .
7.6113	Why did we not think of that ? ''
9.0762	Then he raised his horn high .
17.8526	`` Now hear my vow .
16.2831	I say that I will not cut my hair or comb it until I am king of all Norway .
4.7856	That I will be or I will die . ''
36.0635	Then he drank off the horn of mead , and while he drank it , all the men in the hall stood up and waved their swords and shouted and shouted .
24.4307	That old hall in all its two hundred years of feasts had not heard such a noise before .
14.3412	`` Ah , Harald ! ''
7.4569	Guthorm cried , `` surely Thor in Valhalla smiled when he heard that vow . ''
12.7655	The men sat all night talking of that wonderful vow .
19.8183	On the very next day King Harald sent out his war-arrows .
8.9304	Soon a great army was gathered .
18.1577	They marched through the country north and south and east and west , burning houses and fighting battles as they went .
9.9806	People fled before them , some to their own kings , some inland to the deep woods and hid there .
4.5298	But some went to King Harald and said : `` We will be your men . ''
3.7580	`` Then take the oath , and I will be friends with you , '' he said .
24.9973	The men took off their swords and laid them down and came one by one and knelt before the king .
55.3413	They put their heads between his knees and said : `` From this day , Harald Halfdanson , I am your man .
7.7484	I will serve you in war .
6.6243	For my land I will pay you taxes .
4.2641	I will be faithful to you as my king . ''
10.1203	Then Harald said : `` I am your king , and I will be faithful to you . ''
5.2347	Many kings took that oath and thousands of common men .
3.9793	Of all the battles that Harald fought , he did not lose one .
9.3737	Now for a long time the king 's hair and beard had not been combed or cut .
1.6753	They stood out around his head in a great bushy mat of yellow .
134.8163	At a feast one day when the jokes were going round , Harald 's uncle said : `` Harald , I will give you a new name .
17.8322	After this you shall be called Harald Shockhead .
6.4418	As my naming gift I give you this drinking-horn . ''
2.3023	`` It is a good name , '' laughed all the men .
17.4458	After that all people called him Harald Shockhead .
15.0584	During these wars , whenever King Harald got a country for his own , this is what he did .
3.1875	He said : `` All the marshland and the woodland where no people live is mine .
4.9901	For his farm every man shall pay me taxes . ''
0.4094	Over every country he put some brave , wise man and called him Earl .
4.1007	He said to the earls : `` You shall collect the taxes and pay them to me .
7.6695	But some you shall keep for yourselves .
0.2178	You shall punish any man who steals or murders or does any wicked thing .
7.9262	When your people are in trouble they shall come to you , and you shall set the thing right .
7.6354	You must keep peace in the land .
4.4198	I will not have my people troubled with robber vikings . ''
5.2095	The earls did all these things as best they could ; for they were good strong men .
9.8763	The farmers were happy .
2.9137	They said : `` We can work on our farms with peace now .
13.4022	Before King Harald came , something was always wrong .
16.4541	The vikings would come and steal our gold and our grain and burn our houses , or the king would call us to war .
8.7629	Those little kings are always fighting .
14.2616	It is better under King Harald . ''
20.5851	But the chiefs , who liked to fight and go a-viking , hated King Harald and his new ways .
22.6205	One of these chiefs was Solfi .
7.3470	He was a king 's son .
14.5488	Harald had killed his father in battle .
14.4270	Solfi had been in that battle .
8.1934	At the end of it he fled away with two hundred men and got into ships .
3.9522	`` We will make that Shockhead smart , '' he said .
10.1304	So they harried the coast of King Harald 's country .
8.4545	They filled their ships with gold .
8.5873	They ate other men 's meals .
9.6324	They burned farmhouses behind them .
5.8797	The people cried out to the earls for help .
30.0027	So the earls had out their ships all the time trying to catch Solfi , but he was too clever for them .
104.6128	In the spring he went to a certain king , Audbiorn , and said to him : `` Now , there are two things that we can do .
31.7709	We can become this Shockhead Harald 's thralls , we can kneel before him and put our heads between his knees .
9.0396	Or else we can fight .
3.6776	My father thought it better to die in battle than to be any man 's thrall .
10.3351	How is it ?
0.6406	Will you join with my cousin Arnvid and me against this young Shockhead ? ''
2.0575	`` Yes , I will do it , '' said the king .
17.0669	Many men felt as Solfi did .
15.1897	So when King Audbiorn and King Arnvid sent out their war arrows , a great host gathered .
8.9567	All men came by sea .
73.1409	Two hundred ships lay at anchor in the fiord , looking like strange swimming animals because of their high carved prows and bright paint .
3.3347	There were red and gold dragons with long necks and curved tails .
9.6581	Sea-horses reared out of the water .
17.2090	Green and gold snakes coiled up .
11.1854	Sea-hawks sat with spread wings ready to fly .
27.8995	And among all these curved necks stood up the tall , straight masts with the long yardarms swinging across them holding the looped-up sails .
18.0641	When the starting horn blew , and their sails were let down , it was like the spreading of hundreds of curious flags .
5.4367	Some were striped black and yellow or blue and gold .
37.7971	Some were white with a black raven or a brown bear embroidered on them , or blue with a white sea-hawk , or black with a gold sun .
9.2709	Some were edged with fur .
39.5098	As the wind filled the gaudy sails , and the ships moved off , the men waved their hands to the women on shore and sang : `` To the sea !
9.5934	To the sea !
6.2609	The wind in our sail , The sea in our face , And the smell of the fight .
86.1803	After ship meets ship , In the quarrel of swords King Harald shall lie In the caves under sea And Norsemen shall laugh . ''
0.3054	In the prow stood men leaning forward and sniffing the salt air with joy .
15.2292	Some were talking of King Harald .
8.0509	`` Yesterday he had a hard fight , '' they said .
1.7508	`` To-day he will be lying still , dressing his wounds and mending his ships .
7.3211	We shall take him by surprise . ''
9.2412	They sailed near the coast .
9.7127	Solfi in his `` Sea-hawk '' was ahead leading the way .
4.5589	Suddenly men saw his sail veer and his oars flash out .
5.1460	He had quickly turned his boat and was rowing back .
2.0586	He came close to King Arnvid and called : `` He is there , ahead .
7.3935	His boats are ready in line of battle .
7.6959	The fox has not been asleep . ''
18.6537	King Arnvid blew his horn .
0.2674	Slowly his boats came into line with his `` Sea-stag '' in the middle .
9.5123	Again he blew his horn .
34.9900	Cables were thrown across from one prow to the next , and all the ships were tied together so that their sides touched .
17.3396	Then the men set their sails again and they went past a tongue of land into a broad fiord .
22.3177	There lay the long line of King Harald 's ships with their fierce heads grinning and mocking at the newcomers .
23.8156	Back of those prows was what looked like a long wall with spots of green and red and blue and yellow and shining gold .
10.9821	It was the locked shields of the men in the bows , and over every shield looked fierce blue eyes .
101.5729	Higher up and farther back was another wall of shields ; for on the half deck in the stern of every ship stood the captain with his shield-guard of a dozen men .
21.8412	Arnvid 's people had furled their sails and were taking down the masts , but the ships were still drifting on with the wind .
3.2922	The horn blew , and quickly every man sprang to his place in bow and stern .
6.1012	All were leaning forward with clenched teeth and widespread nostrils .
6.1438	They were clutching their naked swords in their hands .
8.6787	Their flashing eyes looked over their shields .
88.3938	Soon King Arnvid 's ships crashed into Harald 's line , and immediately the men in the bows began to swing their swords at one another .
25.7443	The soldiers of the shield-guard on the high decks began to throw darts and stones and to shoot arrows into the ships opposite them .
19.9990	So in every ship showers of stones and arrows were falling , and many men died under them or got broken arms or legs .
5.7122	Spears were hurled from deck to deck and many of them bit deep into men 's bodies .
1.7938	In every bow men slashed with their swords at the foes in the opposite ship .
2.4202	Some jumped upon the gunwale to get nearer or hung from the prow-head .
7.1380	Some even leaped into the enemy 's boat .
9.7779	King Harald 's ship lay prow to prow with King Arnvid 's .
15.1491	The battle had been going on for an hour .
10.3738	King Harald was still in the stern on the deck .
1.6768	There was a dent in his helmet where a great stone had struck .
2.9615	There was a gash in his shoulder where a spear had cut .
4.6803	But he was still fighting and laughed as he worked .
6.4092	`` Wolf meets wolf to-day , '' he said .
1.4553	`` But things are going badly in the prow , '' he cried .
19.0829	`` Ivar fallen , Thorstein wounded , a dozen men lying in the bottom of the boat ! ''
26.1489	He leaped down from the deck and ran along the gunwale , shouting as he went : `` Harald and victory ! ''
3.5902	So he came to the bow and stood swinging his sword as fast as he breathed .
10.6260	Every time it hit a man of Arnvid 's men .
13.5304	Harald 's own warriors cheered , seeing him .
16.2465	`` Harald and victory ! ''
4.1679	they shouted , and went to work again with good heart .
9.5040	Slowly King Arnvid 's men fell back before Harald 's biting sword .
43.1203	Then Harald 's men threw a great hook into that boat and pulled it alongside and still pushed King Arnvid 's people back .
9.4327	`` Come on !
8.9870	Follow me ! ''
21.0516	cried Harald .
0.3832	Then he leaped into King Arnvid 's boat , and his warriors followed him .
36.0728	`` He comes like a mad wolf , '' King Arnvid 's men said , and they turned and ran back below the deck .
9.8841	Then Arnvid himself leaped down and stood with his sword raised .
4.6732	`` Can this young Shockhead make cowards of you all ? ''
10.4282	he cried .
7.0269	But Harald 's sword struck him , and he fell dead .
11.8701	Then a big , bloody viking of King Arnvid leaped upon the edge of the ship and stood there .
5.0139	He held his drinking-horn and his sword high in his hands .
0.3181	`` Ran and not you , Shockhead , shall have them and me ! ''
2.8567	he cried , and leaped laughing into the water and was drowned .
8.2603	Many other warriors chose the same death on that terrible day .
10.0724	All along the line of boats men fought for hours .
1.5788	In some places the cables had been cut , and the boats had drifted apart .
19.1076	Ships lay scattered about two by two , fighting .
57.7845	May boats sank , many men died , some fled away in their ships , and at the end King Harald had won the battle .
4.6351	So he had King Arnvid 's country and King Audbiorn 's country .
5.8189	Many men took the oath and became his friends .
6.8020	All people were talking of his wonderful battles .
10.6427	It had taken King Harald ten years to fight so many battles .
1.5782	And all that time he had not cut his hair or combed it .
14.2302	Now he was feasting one day at an earl 's house .
9.7392	Many people were there .
7.4934	`` How is it , friends ? ''
19.7750	Harald said .
6.9063	`` Have I kept my vow ? ''
4.7115	His friends answered : `` You have kept your vow .
7.2007	There is no king but you in all Norway . ''
0.1982	`` Then I think I will cut my hair , '' the king laughed .
5.4793	So he went and bathed and put on fresh clothes .
10.3723	Then the earl cut his hair and beard and combed them and put a gold band about his head .
5.5277	Then he looked at him and said : `` It is beautiful , smooth , and yellow . ''
2.6546	And all people wondered at the beauty of the king 's hair .
1.2847	`` I will give you a new name , '' the earl said .
7.6906	`` You shall no longer be called Shockhead .
19.6725	You shall be called Harald Hairfair . ''
4.6201	`` It is a good name , '' everybody cried .
3.7970	Then Harald said : `` But I have another thing to do now .
21.4995	Guthorm , you shall take the same message to Gyda that you gave ten years ago . ''
29.6007	So Guthorm went and brought back this answer from Gyda : `` I will marry the king of all Norway . ''
36.4870	So when the wedding time came , Harald rode across the country to the home of Gyda 's father , Eric .
9.2843	Many men followed him .
6.2029	They were all richly dressed in velvet and gold .
21.3773	For three nights they feasted at Eric 's house .
11.5707	On the next night Gyda sat on the cross-bench with her women .
5.0191	A long veil of white linen covered her face and head and hung down to the ground .
58.4600	After the mead-horns had been brought in , Eric stood up from his high seat and went down and stood before King Harald .
17.4155	`` Will you marry Gyda now ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
14.9745	Harald jumped to his feet and laughed .
6.5996	`` Yes , '' he said .
7.5913	`` I have waited long enough . ''
5.7548	Then he stepped down from his high seat and stood by Eric .
9.0381	They walked about the hall .
10.3039	Before them walked thralls carrying candles .
11.9565	Behind them walked many of King Harald 's great earls .
18.3769	Three times they walked around the hall .
20.4794	The third time they stopped before the cross-bench .
4.7119	King Harald and Eric stepped upon the platform , where the cross-bench was .
10.5906	Eric gave a holy hammer to Harald , and it was like the hammer of Thor .
312.0831	Harald put it upon Gyda 's lap , saying : `` With this holy hammer of Thor 's , I , Harald , King of Norway , take you , Gyda , for my wife . ''
59.2137	Then he took a bunch of keys and tied it to Gyda 's girdle , saying : `` This is the sign that you are mistress of my house . ''
136.5822	After that , Eric called out loudly : `` Now , are Harald , King of Norway , and Gyda , daughter of Eric , man and wife . ''
7.4809	Then thralls brought meat and drink in golden dishes .
104.1497	They were about to serve it to Gyda for the bride 's feast , but Harald took the dish from them and said : `` No , I will serve my bride . ''
8.2377	So he knelt and held the platter .
7.4469	When he did that his men shouted .
0.4865	Then they talked among themselves , saying : `` Surely Harald never knelt before .
4.5052	It is always other people who kneel to him . ''
18.5406	When the bride had tasted the food and touched the mead-horn to her lips she stood up and walked from the hall .
1.4019	All her women followed her , but the men stayed and feasted long .
14.4375	On the next morning at breakfast Gyda sat by Harald 's side .
5.1284	Soon the king rose and said : `` Father-in-law , our horses stand ready in the yard .
3.6301	Work is waiting for me at home and on the sea .
9.9971	Lead out the bride . ''
0.4168	So Eric took Gyda by the hand and led her out of the hall .
20.5834	Harald followed close .
191.9908	When they passed through the door Eric said : `` With this hand I lead my daughter out of my house and give her to you , Harald , son of Halfdan , to be your wife .
15.2441	May all the gods make you happy ! ''
74.6249	Harald led his bride to the horse and lifted her up and set her behind his saddle and said : `` Now this Gyda is my wife . ''
9.4752	Then they drank the stirrup-horn and rode off .
24.6837	`` Everything comes to King Harald , '' his men said ; `` wife and land and crown and victory in battle .
7.7217	He is a lucky man . ''
25.8352	Now many men hated King Harald .
7.5188	Many a man said : `` Why should he put himself up for king of all of us ?
7.5164	He is no better than I am .
5.7990	Am I not a king 's son as well as he ?
6.6431	And are not many of us kings ' sons ?
2.6222	I will not kneel before him and promise to be his man .
8.3221	I will not pay him taxes .
5.9926	I will not have his earl sitting over me .
16.3888	The good old days have gone .
14.9367	This Norway has become a prison .
4.6336	I will go away and find some other place . ''
9.7807	So hundreds of men sailed away .
8.4397	Some went to France and got land and lived there .
54.3916	Big Rolf-go-afoot and all his men sailed up the great French River and won a battle against the French king himself .
6.0934	There was no way to stop the flashing of his battle-axes but to give him what he wanted .
27.5598	So the king made Rolf a duke , gave him broad lands and gave him the king 's own daughter for wife .
20.4598	Rolf called his country Normandy , for old Norway .
20.3006	He ruled it well and was a great lord , and his sons ' sons after him were kings of England .
22.6929	Other Norsemen went to Ireland and England and Scotland .
5.7737	They drew up their boats on the river banks .
11.9034	The people ran away before them and gathered into great armies that marched back to meet the vikings in battle .
20.4258	Sometimes the Norsemen lost , but oftener they won , so that they got land and lived in those countries .
94.5175	Their houses sat in these strange lands like warriors ' camps , and the Norsemen went among their new neighbors with hanging swords and spears in hand , ever ready for fight .
14.2055	There are many islands north of Scotland .
9.1034	They are called the Orkneys and the Shetlands .
8.1084	They have many good harbors for ships .
6.2994	They are little and rocky and bare of trees .
10.8176	Wild sea-birds scream around them .
5.4534	On some of them a man can stand in the middle and see the ocean all about him .
10.0446	Now the vikings sailed to these islands and were pleased .
1.3664	`` It is like being always in a boat , '' they said .
6.6070	`` This shall be our home . ''
1.8466	So it went until all the lands round about were covered with vikings .
8.5356	Norse carved and painted houses brightened the hillsides .
2.9378	Viking ships sailed all the seas and made harbor in every river .
17.5425	Norsemen 's thralls plowed the soil and planted crops and herded cattle , and gold flowed into their masters ' treasure-chests .
6.5957	Norse warriors walked up and down the land , and no man dared to say them nay .
16.4913	These men did not forget Norway .
8.0116	In the summers they sailed back there and harried the coast .
2.9350	They took gold and grain and beautiful cloth back to their homes .
12.8668	In Norway they left burning houses and weeping women .
0.8841	Every summer King Harald had out his ships and men and hunted these vikings .
14.9665	There are many little islands about Norway .
7.3920	They have crags and caves and deep woods .
6.3257	Here the vikings hid when they saw King Harald 's ships coming .
35.8634	But Harald ran his boat into every creek and fiord and hunted in every cave and through all the woods and among the crags .
9.4987	He caught many men , but most of them got away and went home laughing at Harald .
0.8285	Then they came back the next summer and did the same deeds over again .
0.5395	At last King Harald said : `` There is but one thing to do .
3.1878	I must sail to these western islands and whip these robbers in their own homes . ''
6.0961	So he went with a great number of ships .
8.2145	He found as brave men as he had brought from Norway .
4.0893	These vikings had brought their old courage to their new homes .
4.1659	King Harald 's fine ships were scarred by viking stones and scorched by viking fire .
9.1187	The shields of Harald 's warriors had dents from viking blows .
5.3443	Many of those men carried viking scars all their lives .
162.2409	And many of King Harald 's warriors walked the long , hard road to Valhalla , and feasted there with some of these very vikings that had died in King Harald 's battles .
238.7149	But after many hard fights on land and sea , after many men had died and many had fled away to other lands , King Harald won , and he made the men that were yet in the islands take the oath , and he left his earls to rule over them .
15.9882	Then he went back to Norway .
0.1833	`` He has done more than he vowed to do , '' people said .
7.8011	`` He has not only whipped the vikings , but he has got a new kingdom west-over-seas . ''
4.9864	Then they talked of that dream that his mother had .
6.8224	`` King Harald was that great tree , '' they said .
30.0096	`` The trunk was red with the blood of his many battles , but higher up the limbs were fair and green like this good time of peace .
0.4546	The topmost branches were white because Harald will live to be an old man .
127.3987	Just as that tree spread out until all of Norway was in its shade , and even more lands , so Harald is king of all this country and of the western islands .
219.4421	The many branches of that tree are the many sons of Harald , who shall be earls and kings in Norway , and their sons after them , for hundreds of years . ''
13.0370	Men had been feasting in Ingolf 's house .
4.7818	But there was no laughing and no shouting of jokes .
13.4238	Ingolf sat in his high seat frowning and gloomy .
8.6544	His head hung on his breast .
8.1750	He was staring into the fire .
9.5248	Now he raised his head and looked about the hall .
2.5499	`` Comrades , '' he said , `` what shall we do ?
20.5400	Herstein and Holmstein died by our swords .
8.5315	Their kinsmen hunger to kill us .
29.2922	Besides , when Harald hears of our deed , there will not be a safe place in Norway for us .
4.4222	He will never let a man fight out an honest quarrel .
9.9392	Where shall we go ? ''
7.4206	A man stood up from the bench .
4.5792	`` We have friends in the Shetlands , '' he said .
7.7646	`` Let us find homes there . ''
8.8843	Then Leif , in the high seat opposite Ingolf , stood up .
7.8571	`` No , not the Shetlands , my foster-brother .
9.8104	They are crowded already .
8.3629	Besides , Harald will not long keep his hands off them .
14.6145	Then they will be no better than Norway .
24.8807	England and Ireland and Scotland are old .
9.3379	My eyes ache for something new .
14.0770	What of that far island that Floki found ?
9.7981	It is empty .
5.8598	We could choose our land from the whole country .
9.6277	There is good fishing .
9.7358	There are green valleys .
10.8659	And Butter Thorolf says that butter drops from every weed .
5.2669	There are mountains and deserts where we may find adventure .
11.4537	I say , let us steer for Iceland ! ''
3.0440	When he stopped , many of the men shouted : `` Yes !
19.7585	Iceland ! ''
7.9750	But an old man stood up .
2.8908	`` We have all laughed at that tale of Butter Thorolf 's , '' he said .
244.0499	`` But Floki himself said that the sea about the island is full of ice that pushes upon the land , that no ship can live in that water in the winter , that great mountains of ice cover the island .
67.1041	Did not all his cattle die there of hunger and cold , and did he not come back to Norway cursing Iceland ? ''
17.5988	`` Oh , Sighvat , you are old and fearful , '' called out Leif , and he laughed .
4.5299	Then he stretched himself up and threw back his head .
8.0343	`` Are we afraid of ice ?
9.8553	Have we not seen angry water before ?
2.3469	I have been hungry , but I have never died of it .
7.2696	Surely if there are fish in the sea and grass in the valleys , we can live there .
109.1991	I should like to stand on a hill and look around on a wide land and think , ` This is all ours , ' and out upon a rough sea and think , ` Far off there are our foes and they dare not come over to us . '
4.3073	Besides , we shall have no Shockhead Harald to lord it over us .
2.6556	We can come and go and feast and fight as we please .
8.0948	We shall be our own kings .
6.3451	And our ships will be always waiting to take us away , when we are weary of it .
4.1919	And we shall see things that other men have never seen .
8.0681	I am tired of the old things .
302.0720	Perhaps in after days men will make songs about ` those foster-brothers , Ingolf and Leif , who made a new country in a wonderful land , and whose sons and grandsons are mighty men in Iceland ! ' ''
16.3706	Ingolf leaped up from his chair .
7.5693	`` By the strong arm of Thor ! ''
4.4978	he cried , `` I like the sound of it .
15.1702	Now I make my vow . ''
13.6730	He raised his drinking-horn .
128.5125	`` I vow that I will find this Iceland and pass the winter there , and that if man can live upon it I will go back there and set up my home . ''
0.4033	`` And I vow that I will follow my foster-brother , '' cried Leif .
8.4812	And many men vowed to go .
10.6940	So on the next day they began to make ready a boat .
37.8346	They looked her over carefully and recalked every seam and freshly painted her and put into her their strongest oars and made her a new sail .
2.9490	`` This will be the longest voyage that she ever made , '' Ingolf said .
129.7921	When the work was done , they put into her great stores , axes , hammers , fish-nets , cooking-kettles , kegs of ale , chests of hard bread , chests of smoked meat , brass kettles full of flour , skin bottles of water .
3.6091	They stowed these things away in the ends of the ship .
7.9616	When they were ready they put in four head of cattle .
0.3834	`` We shall need the milk and perhaps the meat , '' Ingolf said .
31.1235	Many men wished to go , but Ingolf had said : `` There is little room to spare and little food and drink .
19.1543	I have planned for half a year .
6.1328	But perhaps we must be sailing longer than that .
9.6759	Our food may run short .
7.5798	We must not have extra mouths to feed .
14.3961	There are thirty oars in our boat .
12.1313	I will take only one man for every oar , and Leif and I will steer . ''
9.4162	So they started off .
39.8083	Leif stood in the prow leaning forward and looking far ahead , and he sang : `` What does the swimming dragon smell ?
1.8663	A stormy sea , an empty land , Hunger , darkness , giants , fire .
11.0439	Leif and his sword do laugh at that . ''
12.3192	They sailed for days and saw no land .
2.0031	Sometimes they passed ships and always made sure to sail close enough to hail them .
8.1798	`` Where are you going ? ''
18.8531	Ingolf would call .
9.8220	`` To Norway , '' would come back the answer .
7.8700	`` For trade or fight ? ''
20.1709	Leif would shout .
19.3192	Then would ring out a great laugh from that boat and this answer : `` A shut mouth is a good friend . ''
42.4984	So the two ships sailed on , and the men were glad to have heard a greeting and to have called one .
10.0898	But at last there were the Shetlands .
4.8801	`` We will go in here and rest , '' Ingolf said .
5.1098	When they rowed to shore a certain Shetland man stood there .
5.1899	He watched them land and looked them all over .
3.0469	Then he walked up to Ingolf and said : `` You look like brave men .
19.1959	Welcome to Shetland .
4.1112	You shall come to my house and rest your legs from ship-going and fill your stomachs .
15.3949	I hunger for news of Norway . ''
7.1726	So they went to his house and stayed there for three days .
10.9376	And good it seemed to be near a fire and in a quiet bed and before a steaming platter .
107.0941	When they went to the shore to start off again , the Shetland man had his thralls carry a keg of ale and a great kettle of cooked meat and put them into the ship .
2.2504	`` Think of me when you eat this , '' he said .
3.0394	Then the Norsemen put to sea again and sailed for a long time .
29.3491	One day a terrible storm came up ; the sky was black ; the wind howled through the ship .
9.1536	Great waves leaped in the sea .
4.3988	`` Down with the sail and out with the oars ! ''
21.0323	Ingolf shouted .
10.2997	So the men furled the sail and took down the mast and laid it along the bottom of the boat .
8.0099	As they worked , one man was washed overboard and drowned .
43.2308	The men sat down to row , but the tumbling waves tossed the boat about and poured over her and broke three of the oars .
8.1396	But still the men held on .
116.0873	They were wet to the skin and were cold , and their arms and legs ached with the hard work , and they were hungry from the long waiting , but not one face was white with fear .
13.1412	`` Ran , in her caves under sea , wants us for company to-night , '' Ingolf laughed .
5.1515	So they tossed about all night , but in the morning the wind died down .
19.2187	Great waves still rolled , and for days the sea was rough , but they could put up the sail .
1094.5014	Then one day Leif , as he sat in the pilot 's seat , jumped to his feet and sang : `` To eyes grown tired with looking far , All at once appeared an island , A stretching-place for sea-legs , A quiet bed for backs grown stiff On rowing-bench on rolling sea .
2.1720	A place to build a red fire And thaw the blood that sea-winds froze . ''
3.6843	But when they came near they saw no place to land .
1.7119	The island was like a mountain of rock standing out of the water .
8.7221	The sides were steep and smooth .
2.4565	They sailed around it , but found no place to climb up .
8.0137	`` There are many other islands here , '' said Leif .
7.1712	`` We will try another . ''
8.8783	So he steered to another .
25.1848	It , too , was a steep rock , but one side sloped down to the water and was green with grass .
49.8138	`` Oh , I have not seen anything so good as that green grass since I looked into my mother 's face , '' one man said .
8.5585	There was a little harbor there .
10.5682	The men rowed in and quickly jumped out and put the rollers under the ship and pulled her upon shore .
6.5124	Then they threw themselves down on the grass and rolled and stretched their arms and shouted for joy .
5.3769	After that they built a fire and warmed themselves and cooked a meal and ate like wolves .
20.2222	They slept there that night .
39.4126	In the morning before Ingolf 's men started away they were standing high up on the hillside , looking about .
11.5965	They saw no houses on any of the islands , but they saw smoke rise from one hillside .
19.4019	`` Some other men , like us , weary of the sea and stopping to rest , '' said Ingolf .
7.9987	They saw the island that they had sailed around the night before .
11.7297	`` There can surely be nothing but birds ' nests on top of that , '' Sighvat said .
9.3088	`` Look ! ''
9.7414	cried another , pointing .
5.0741	Men were standing on the flat top of that island .
4.3392	They were letting a boat down the steep side with ropes .
18.4201	When it struck the water , they made a rope fast to the rock and slid down it into the ship and sailed off .
14.8577	`` Some robber vikings from Scotland or Ireland , '' laughed Leif .
4.8753	`` It is a good hiding place for treasure . ''
5.2644	Soon Ingolf and his men got into their ship and were off .
16.5790	Old Sighvat grumbled .
1.7546	`` Is this land not new enough and empty enough and far enough ?
0.2181	I am tired of sea , sea , sea , and nothing else . ''
26.1050	`` We started for Iceland , '' said Ingolf , `` and I will not stop before I come there .
9.1043	I have a vow .
15.7606	Did you make none , Sighvat ? ''
0.3937	Then they were on the water again for weeks with no sight of land .
9.2169	`` Oh !
50.1971	I would give my right hand to see a dragon pawing the water off there and to fling a word to its men , '' Sighvat said .
10.8782	`` No hope of that , '' replied Ingolf .
36.8368	`` Only three dragons before ours have ever swept this water , and men are not sailing this way for pleasure or riches . ''
7.8134	So only the desolate sea stretched around them .
6.7823	Sometimes it was smooth and shining under the sun .
14.0132	Often it was torn by winds , and a gray sky hung over it , and the men were drenched with rain .
16.4849	Once they ran into a fog .
5.9914	For three days and nights they could not see sun or stars to steer by .
8.6690	They forgot which way was north .
138.2695	When after three days the fog lifted , they found that they had been going in the wrong direction , and they had to turn around and sail all that weary way over again .
11.9881	But at last one afternoon they saw a white cloud resting on the water far off .
21.4739	As they sailed toward it , it grew into long stretches of black , hilly shore with a blue ice mountain rising from it .
25.8218	The sun was going down behind that mountain , and long lines of pink and of shining green , and great purple shadows streaked the blue .
14.1761	`` It is Iceland ! ''
10.3000	shouted the men .
9.7842	`` It is like Asgard the Shining , '' Ingolf said .
8.5187	But it was still far off .
1.7322	Men can see a long way there because the air is so clear .
9.6577	So Ingolf and his people sailed on for hours and at last came into a harbor .
7.2478	A little green valley sloped up from it .
14.2512	On one side was the bright ice mountain .
6.6677	Back of it were bare black and red hills .
2.8166	In that valley Ingolf and his men drew up their boat and camped .
109.4916	At supper that night one of the men said : `` I almost think I never felt a fire before or had warm food in my mouth . ''
10.2839	The men laughed .
5.8778	`` It is four months since we left Norway , '' Ingolf said .
2.7807	`` Few men have ever been on the sea so long . ''
0.4455	That night they put up the awning in the boat and slept under it .
0.6789	After that some men went fishing every day in the rowboat that they had .
19.0247	And Ingolf took others , and they sailed along the shore , seeing what kind of a land this was .
14.3834	But winter began to come on .
25.8845	Then Ingolf said : `` Remember what Floki said of the ice and the rough sea in winter .
8.2249	Soon we can not sail any longer .
9.5668	Let us choose a place to stay and build a hut there and cut hay for our cattle . ''
10.0904	So they did .
4.3550	Their hut was a little mean thing of stones and turf .
5.4754	They kept the cattle and the hay in it .
5.4465	Sometimes they slept there , when it was very cold .
10.4937	But most of the time they ate and slept by a great bonfire out of doors where it was clean .
62.1288	Leif said : `` I like the cold air of the sea better than the bad-smelling air of a house , even though it is warm . ''
7.4691	Now every day Ingolf and Leif and some of the men walked about the island .
23.2441	At night they all sat around the campfire and talked of what they had seen during the day .
7.4102	`` This is surely a wonderful land , '' Ingolf said once .
5.1016	`` It is at the same time like Niflheim and like Asgard .
1.7453	Here is a spot green and soft , a sweet cradle for men .
2.0752	Next it is a mountain of ice where men would freeze to death .
8.5070	And next to that is a hill of rock that seems to have come out of some great fire .
19.6543	Yesterday I saw a cave on the seashore .
5.0380	The door of it was big enough for a giant .
8.7560	The waves broke at the doorstep .
8.4393	A terrible roaring came from the cave .
5.5162	I think it is the home of a giant .
1.7431	I think that giants of fire and giants of frost made this island .
3.1648	I have seen great basins in the rocks filled with warm water .
12.3379	They looked like giants ' bath-tubs .
4.2152	I have seen boiling water shoot up out of the ground .
26.5717	I have walked , and have felt and heard a great rumbling under me as though some giant were sleeping there and turning over in his sleep .
23.1563	One day I stood on a mountain and looked inland .
5.1237	There was a wide desert of sand and black and red rock with nothing growing on it .
10.7620	The fierce wind blew dirt into my eyes , and the cold of it froze the marrow in my bones .
23.7210	When I have seen these things I have cursed the country , and have said : ` The gods hate Iceland .
8.4839	I will not stay here . '
1.8880	But then I have walked through beautiful warm valleys where the winds did not come .
10.6341	I saw in my mind the flowers that we found last summer .
6.6501	I saw our cattle feeding on the sweet grass .
6.2609	I thought of the sea full of good fish .
44.3684	I saw my house built among green fields , and my wife sitting in her home , and my children playing among the flowers and making up tales about the bright ice mountains .
0.3789	I saw the wide , rough seas between me and Harald and our foes .
1.4476	Then I thought to myself , ` It is the sweetest home on earth . '
4.3874	As for me , I am coming here to live .
7.9934	What do you say , comrades ? ''
3.6090	`` Have I not vowed to follow you , foster-brother ? ''
19.8725	said Leif .
2.8391	`` And indeed I never saw a land that I liked better .
7.4184	I do n't believe in your giants .
14.1185	My sword is my god , and my ship is my temple , and I like this land to set them up in . ''
14.1431	They sat about the fire long that night making plans .
18.6984	`` You shall go home and get our women and our things , Ingolf , '' said Leif .
9.1364	`` I will off to Ireland and have a frolic .
56.7730	There will be little play of swords in this empty land , and I want to have one last game before I hang up my battle-knife .
66.2586	Besides , I will come to you with a ship full of gold and clothes and house-hangings such as we can not get here , and they will cost me nothing but the swing of a sword . ''
9.3057	As they talked , Ingolf looked up at the sky .
9.3615	The northern lights were quivering there .
4.4982	They were like great flames of yellow and green and red .
4.8477	`` See , '' he said , and pointed .
2.9552	`` We are not so far that the gods will forget us .
6.3867	There is the flash of the armor of the Valkyrias .
22.5177	A battle is on somewhere , and Odin has sent his maidens to choose the heroes for Valhalla . ''
13.7570	Leif only laughed and lay down to sleep .
12.8439	So in the spring they all went back to Norway .
13.3019	Leif got ready the boat again and merrily sailed for Ireland .
1.5753	`` Here I go to get riches for our new land , '' he said .
13.1355	Ingolf set his men to cutting down pines in the forest and some to building a new ship .
13.5726	He had his thralls plant large crops of grain and grind flour and make new kegs and chests of wood .
25.7055	He himself worked much at the forge , making all kinds of tools -- spades , axes , hammers , hunting-knives , cooking kettles .
7.3373	The women were busy weaving and sewing new clothes .
3.0842	Ingolf sold his house and land and everything that he could not take with him .
34.8988	After about two years Leif came back .
13.9508	He had ten thralls that he had got in Ireland .
3.1371	He took Ingolf aboard his ship and raised the covers of great chests .
2.7680	Gold helmets , silver-trimmed drinking-horns , embroidered robes , and swords flashed out .
2.0119	`` Did I not say that I would come back with a full ship ? ''
10.4986	he laughed .
7.5389	At last all things were ready for starting .
5.1274	`` To-day I will sacrifice to Thor and Odin , '' Ingolf said .
4.2158	`` If the omens are good we will start to-morrow . ''
8.7616	`` Well , go , foster-brother , '' laughed Leif .
6.2796	`` But I have better things to do .
1.4989	I will be putting the cattle into the ship and will have all ready . ''
5.2963	So Ingolf and his men went into the forests a little way .
6.2524	There in a cleared space stood a large building .
8.0940	In front of this temple the men killed two horses for Odin .
9.7384	Ingolf caught some of the blood in a brass bowl .
120.6295	He raised it and looked up at the sky and said : `` All-wise and all-father Odin , and Thor who loves the thunder , I give these horses to you .
2.5886	Tell me whether it is your will that we go to Iceland . ''
3.9614	As he said that , a raven flew over his head .
19.0112	Ingolf watched it .
2.3816	`` It is Odin 's will that we go , '' he said .
6.3686	`` He sent his raven to tell us .
15.1998	It is flying straight toward Iceland . ''
7.8469	The men shouted with joy at that .
6.0015	Now they hung some of the meat of the horses on a tree near the temple .
8.3403	`` For the ravens of Odin , '' they said .
11.9861	Ingolf carried the bowl of blood into the temple .
1.7251	He went through the feast hall in front to a little room at the back .
5.7303	Here stood wooden statues of the gods in a semicircle .
8.5495	Before them was a stone altar .
25.9980	Ingolf took a little brush of twigs that lay on it and dipped it into the blood and sprinkled the statues .
3.5238	`` You shall taste of our sacrifice , '' he said .
3.0296	`` Look kindly on us from your happy seats in Asgard . ''
8.0698	Then they went into the feast hall .
4.5153	There thralls were boiling the horseflesh in pots over the fire .
7.6207	The tables were standing ready before the benches .
16.3414	Ingolf walked to the high seat .
5.5622	All the others took their places at the benches .
51.6177	When the horns came round , Ingolf made this vow : `` I vow that I will build my house wherever these pillars lead me . ''
0.2388	He put his hand upon a tall post that stood beside the high seat .
14.4124	There was one at each side .
6.6455	They were the front posts of the chair .
5.1033	But they stood up high , almost to the roof .
5.3201	They were wonderfully carved and painted with men and dragons .
4.3953	On the top of each one was a little statue of Thor with his hammer .
0.4265	At the end of the feast Ingolf had his thralls dig these pillars up .
1.8349	He had a little bronze chest filled with the earth that was under the altar .
318.0579	`` I will take the pillars of my high seat to Iceland , '' he said , `` and I will set up my altar there upon the soil of Norway , the soil that all my ancestors have trod , the soil that Thor loves . ''
33.4299	So they carried the pillars and the chest of earth and the statues of the gods , and put them into Ingolf 's boat .
4.6417	`` It is a well-packed ship , '' the men said .
6.1072	`` There is no spot to spare . ''
29.2133	Tools , and chests of food , and tubs of drink , and chests of clothes , and fishing nets were stowed in the bows of both boats .
3.4950	In the bottom were laid some long , heavy , hewn logs .
9.7528	`` The trees in Iceland are little , '' Ingolf said .
1.3556	`` We must take the great beams for our homes with us . ''
0.2192	Standing on these logs were a few cattle and sheep and horses and pigs .
6.9453	The rowers ' benches were along the sides .
5.1400	In the stern of each boat was a little cabin .
6.7704	Here the women and children were to sleep .
16.1013	But the men would sleep on the timbers in the middle of the boat and perhaps they would put up the awning sometimes .
10.2593	At last everyone was aboard .
7.5380	Men loosed the rope that held the boats .
21.9901	The ships flashed down the rollers into the water , and Ingolf and Leif were off for Iceland .
3.5096	As they sailed away everyone looked back at the shore of old Norway .
6.5498	There were tears in the women 's eyes .
3.6287	Helga , Leif 's wife , sang : `` There was I born .
9.2452	There was I wed. .
7.6250	There are my father 's bones .
0.1916	There are the hills and fields , The streams and rocks that I love .
16.3763	There are houses and temples , Women and warriors and feasts , Ships and songs and fights -- A crowded , joyous land .
7.0794	I go to an empty land . ''
5.2611	There was the same long voyage with storm and fog .
6.7002	But at last the people saw again the white cloud and saw it growing into land and mountains .
3.1800	Then Ingolf took the pillars of his high seat and threw them overboard .
4.2986	`` Guide them to a good place , O Thor ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
5.7560	The waves caught them up and rolled them about .
14.9821	Ingolf followed them with his ship .
8.1267	But soon a storm came up .
7.5259	The men had to take down the sails and masts , and they could do nothing with their oars .
3.3061	The two ships tossed about in the sea wherever the waves sent them .
7.6375	The pillars drifted away , and Ingolf could not see them .
7.2345	`` Remember your pillars , O Thor ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
5.9914	Then he saw that Leif 's ship was being driven far off .
15.7599	`` Ah , my foster-brother , '' he thought , `` shall I not have you to cheer me in this empty land ?
3.5141	O Thor , let him not go down to the caves of Ran !
5.3971	He is too good a man for that . ''
38.2425	On the next day the storm was not so hard , and Ingolf put in at a good harbor .
6.3101	A high rocky point stuck out into the sea .
2.8667	A broad bay with islands in the mouth was at the side .
0.3642	Behind the rocky point was a level green place with ice-mountains shining far back .
19.9419	After a day or two Ingolf said : `` I will go look for my pillars . ''
27.0674	So he and a few men got into the rowboat and went along the shore and into all the fiords , but they could not find the pillars .
102.0330	After a week they came back , and Ingolf said : `` I will build a house here to live in while I look for the posts .
6.6413	This way is uncomfortable for the women . ''
10.0904	So he did .
10.4240	Then he set out again to look for the pillars , but he had no better luck and came back .
13.1929	`` I must stay at home and see to the making of hay and the drying of fish , '' he said .
8.7553	`` Winter is coming on , and we must not be caught with nothing to eat . ''
10.4118	So he stayed and worked and sent two of his thralls to look for the holy posts .
22.4423	They came back every week or two and always had to say that they had not found them .
9.9185	Midwinter was coming on .
8.4583	`` Ah ! ''
75.7656	said Ingolf 's wife one day , `` do you remember the gay feast that we had at Yule-time ?
8.5582	All our friends were there .
8.2290	The house rang with song and laughter .
8.8792	Our tables bent with good things to eat .
9.8433	Walls were hung with gay draperies .
12.2090	The floor was clean with sweet-smelling pine-branches .
25.7530	Now look at this mean house ; its dirt floor , its bare stone walls , its littleness , its darkness !
9.5781	Look at our long faces .
9.6789	No one here could make a song if he tried .
9.9755	Oh !
14.9481	I am sick for dear old Norway . ''
12.2300	`` It is Thor 's fault , '' Ingolf cried .
4.6062	`` He will not let me find his posts . ''
1.7835	He strode out of the house and stood scowling at the gray sea .
8.3488	`` Ah , foster-brother ! ''
9.8387	he said .
2.7348	`` It was never so gloomy when you were by my side .
19.6506	Where are you now ?
8.4514	Shall I never hear your merry laugh again ?
0.2191	That spot in my palm burns , and my heart aches to see you .
6.8757	That arch of sod keeps rising before my eyes .
7.3417	Our vows keep ringing in my ears . ''
11.5751	At last the long , gloomy winter passed and spring came .
8.9624	`` Cheer up , good wife , '' Ingolf said .
20.6052	`` Better days are coming now . ''
4.2932	But that same day the thralls came back from looking for the posts .
5.2703	`` We have bad news , '' they said .
9.3379	`` As we walked along the shore looking for the pillars we saw a man lying on the shore .
8.3259	We went up to him .
9.6853	He was dead .
17.2747	It was Leif .
20.5198	Two well-built houses stood near .
8.2554	We went to them .
3.7251	We knew from the carving on the door-posts that they were Leif 's .
9.3146	We went in .
9.7688	The rooms were empty .
8.1152	Along the shore and in the wood back of the house we found all of his men , dead .
7.3949	There was no living thing about . ''
5.2904	Ingolf said no word , but his face was white , and his mouth was set .
11.2763	He went into the house and got his spears and his shield and said to his men : `` Follow me . ''
32.6254	They put provisions into the boat and pushed off and sailed until they saw Leif 's houses on the shore of the harbor .
2.5408	There they saw Leif and the men who were his friends , dead .
8.3111	Their swords and spears were gone .
17.8302	Ingolf walked through the houses calling on Helga and on the thralls , but no one answered .
10.1374	The storehouse was empty .
3.9293	The rich hangings were gone from the walls of the houses .
8.2154	There was nothing in the stables .
9.2316	The boat was gone .
9.7592	Ingolf went out and stood on a high point of land that jutted out into the water .
6.2794	Far along the coast he saw some little islands .
0.1685	He turned to his men and said : `` The thralls have done it .
4.6511	I think we shall find them on those islands . ''
7.5581	Then he went back to Leif and stood looking at him .
3.5692	`` What a shame for so brave a man to fall by the hands of thralls !
6.9574	But I have found that such things always happen to men who do not sacrifice to the gods .
20.1569	Ah , Leif !
4.5325	I did not think when we made those vows of foster-brotherhood that this would ever happen .
9.5435	But do not fear .
9.6570	I remember my promise .
14.4009	I had thought that a man 's blood is precious in this empty land , but my vow is more precious . ''
6.9153	Now they laid all those men together and tied on their hell-shoes .
4.9606	`` I need my sword for your sake , foster-brother .
7.2625	I can not give you that .
3.9394	But you shall have my spears and my drinking-horn , '' said Ingolf .
9.3877	`` For surely Odin has chosen you for Valhalla , even though you did not sacrifice .
9.7082	You are too good a man to go to Niflheim .
13.8067	You would make times merry in Valhalla . ''
19.6946	So Ingolf put his spears and his drinking-horn by Leif .
4.3342	Then the men raised a great mound over all the dead .
6.8343	After that they went aboard their boat and sailed for the islands that Ingolf had seen .
13.2943	It was evening when they reached them .
0.5486	`` I see smoke rising from that one , '' Ingolf said , pointing .
9.0251	He steered for it .
82.2508	It was a steep rock like that one in the Faroes , but they found a harbor and landed and climbed the steep hill and came out on top .
11.4314	They saw the ten thralls sitting about a bonfire eating .
20.6718	Helga and the other women from Leif 's house sat near , huddled together , white and frightened .
32.3110	One of the thralls gave a great laugh and shouted : `` This is better than pulling Leif 's plow .
7.5633	To-morrow we will sail for Ireland with all his wealth . ''
122.7552	`` To-morrow you will be freezing in Niflheim , '' cried Ingolf , and he leaped among them swinging his sword , and all his men followed him , and they killed those thralls .
25.2248	Then Ingolf turned to Helga .
6.6552	She threw herself into his arms and wept .
29.2119	But after a while she told him this story : `` When springtime came , Leif thought that he would sow wheat .
16.3187	He had but one ox .
13.7820	The others had died during the winter .
5.7616	So he set the thralls to help pull the plow .
27.8222	I saw their sour looks and was afraid , but Leif only laughed : '' ` What else can thralls expect ? '
9.8387	he said .
6.7471	` Never fear them , good wife . '
61.9905	`` Now one day soon after that the thralls came running to the house calling out : '' ` The ox is dead !
8.9549	The ox is dead ! '
14.5441	`` Leif asked them about it .
16.7151	They said that a bear had come out of the woods and killed it , and that they had scared the beast away .
7.2708	They pointed out where it had gone .
4.7056	Then Leif called his men and said : '' ' A hunt !
6.4889	I had not hoped for such great sport here .
4.6835	Ah , we will have a feast off that bear ! '
2.9010	`` So they took their spears and went out into the woods .
27.5477	As soon as they were gone , the thralls came running into the house and took down all the swords and shields from the wall and ran out .
2.7014	In some way they met my lord and his men in the woods and killed them .
9.7292	Then they came back and took everything in the house and dragged us to the boat and sailed here . ''
9.2148	`` O my brother ! ''
508.0780	said Ingolf , `` where is that song about ` those two foster-brothers , Ingolf and Leif , who made a new country in a wonderful land , and whose sons and grandsons are mighty men in Iceland ' ?
13.6803	But come home with me , Helga . ''
8.7509	So they took the women and Leif 's things and Leif 's boat and sailed home .
111.9997	The next day after they came to Ingolf 's house , Helga said : `` We have made your family larger , brother Ingolf .
8.9055	Will you not take Leif 's two houses and live in them ?
15.2585	He does not need them now .
5.6984	He would like you to have them . ''
5.1177	`` It would be pleasant to live there , '' Ingolf said .
7.8881	`` I thank you . ''
36.7746	So the next day they loaded everything aboard the two ships and sailed for Leif 's house .
21.4240	There they stayed for a year .
8.7163	Ingolf still sent his thralls out to look for the pillars .
3.1759	He was careful always to have hay , so his cattle prospered .
6.1630	That spring he planted wheat , but it did not grow well .
10.9629	`` This is sickly stuff , '' Ingolf said .
6.6970	`` It takes too much time and work .
6.2528	It is better to save the land for hay .
8.2256	Perhaps we can sometime go back to Norway for flour . ''
25.7121	At last one day the thralls came home and said : `` We have found the pillars . ''
17.2328	Ingolf jumped to his feet .
0.6535	He cried out : `` You have kept me waiting three years , Thor .
29.1580	But as soon as my house and temple are built , I will sacrifice to you three horses as a thank-offering . ''
35.0874	`` It is a long way off , master , '' the thralls said , `` and we have found much better places in our walks about the island . ''
14.5360	`` Thor knows best , '' Ingolf answered .
5.2729	`` I will settle where he leads me . ''
57.6186	So that summer they loaded everything into the ships again and sailed west along the coast until they came to the place where the pillars were .
7.3358	The land there was low and green .
8.6044	On both sides were low hills .
9.0897	A little lake glistened back from shore .
6.3335	In the valley were hot springs , with steam rising from them .
4.6124	`` It looks like smoke , '' the men said .
4.9040	`` It is very strange to see hot water and smoke come out of the ground . ''
0.2496	In front of this green land was a good harbor with islands in it .
5.9284	Far over the sea toward the north shone a great ice-mountain .
10.0102	`` I like the place , '' Ingolf said .
6.2140	`` I will make this land mine . ''
43.1389	So he built fires at the mouth of the river near there , and stood by them and called out loudly : `` I have put my fire at the mouth of these rivers .
4.2828	All the land that they drain is mine , and no man shall claim it but me .
13.2566	I will call this place Reykjavik . ''
17.8484	Then Ingolf built his feast hall .
9.0231	He himself carved the beams and the door-posts .
0.2386	Gaily painted dragons leaned out from the doors and stood up from the gables .
10.8273	Men and animals fought on the door-posts .
4.5412	For the doors he made at the forge great iron hinges .
6.0325	Their ends curved and spread all over the door .
16.5948	Near his feast hall he built a storehouse and a kitchen and a smithy and a stable and a bower for the women .
1.8569	`` We do not need a sleeping-house for guests , '' he said .
7.3667	`` Who would be our guests ? ''
7.8816	He roofed all his buildings with turf .
2.0802	It made them look like green mounds with gay carved and painted walls under them .
2.6747	He built also a temple , and on that was beautiful carving .
0.1886	In this he set up those statues that had been in his old temple .
8.9353	He put up , too , those pillars of his high seat that had been drifting about so long .
9.6370	Under them he laid the soil of Norway that he had brought in the little bronze chest .
4.9212	`` I have kept my vow , O Thor ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
11.6136	Then he sacrificed three horses that he had promised to Thor .
3.1646	After that was over , he said : `` Here is a good field for sport .
1.5489	Let us have some of the old games that we used to play at home .
8.7874	Who will wrestle with me ? ''
2.8756	So they wrestled there and ran races and swam in the water .
8.3174	The women sat and looked on .
4.7978	`` Oh , this is good to see ! ''
20.9540	Helga cried .
0.3580	`` We are as gay as we used to be in old Norway . ''
45.9941	But it was not many weeks before Ingolf said : `` I wish that I might sometime see sails in that harbor .
17.3207	I wish that I might think , ` Around this point of land is another farm , and across the bay is another .
5.1651	I can go there when I am very lonely . '
4.2269	I wish that I might sometime be invited to a feast .
3.9385	I wish that I might sometimes hear the good , clanging music of weapons at play .
0.5102	It is a good land , but we have lived alone for four years .
5.8434	I am hungry for new faces and for tidings of Norway . ''
85.7857	One night as he and his men sat about the long fire in the feast hall , a servant threw a great piece of wood upon the fire .
3.1224	It was streaked with faded paint and it showed bits of carving .
29.7817	`` See , '' said Ingolf , pointing to it , `` see what is left of a good ship 's prow !
6.0040	What lands have you seen , O dragon 's head ?
9.7288	What battles have you fought ?
8.5831	What was your master 's name ?
9.6559	Where did the storm meet you ?
12.7444	Perhaps he was coming to Iceland , comrades .
22.7621	Would it not have been pleasant to see his sail and to shake his hand and to welcome him to Iceland ?
6.6690	But instead he is in Ran 's caves , and only his broken prow has drifted here . ''
84.4237	Now it was not many months after that when one of the men came running into the feast hall , shouting : `` A sail !
8.7094	a sail in the harbor ! ''
11.8062	All those men gave a shout with no word in it , as though their hearts had leaped into their throats .
0.1999	They jumped up and ran to the shore and stood there with hungry eyes .
15.6964	When the men landed , those Icelanders clapped them on the shoulders , and tears ran down their faces .
3.8509	For a long time they could say nothing but `` Welcome !
10.3815	Welcome ! ''
18.5706	But after a while Ingolf led them to the feast hall and had a feast spread at once .
1.6492	While the thralls were at work , the men stood together and talked .
4.7104	Such a noise had never been in that hall before .
10.8821	`` We have already built our fires and claimed our land up the shore a way , '' the leader said .
28.6641	`` Men in Norway talk much of Ingolf and Leif , and wonder what has happened to them . ''
33.8244	Then Ingolf told them of all that had come to pass in Iceland ; and then he asked of Norway .
9.2169	`` Ah !
2.9459	things are going from bad to worse , '' the newcomers said .
31.8999	`` Harald grows mightier every day .
5.9627	A man dare not swing a sword now except for the king .
7.0053	We came here to get away from him .
15.9857	Many men are talking of Iceland .
4.2638	Soon the sea-road between here and Norway will be swarming with dragons . ''
9.3068	And so it was .
9.8691	Ships also came from Ireland and from the Shetlands and the Orkneys .
75.4446	`` Harald has come west-over-seas , '' the men of these ships said , `` and has laid his heavy hand upon the islands and put his earls over them .
10.8198	They are no place now for free men . ''
14.1808	So by the time Ingolf was an old man , Iceland was no longer an empty land .
5.7167	Every valley was spotted with bright feast halls and temples .
8.7094	Horses and cattle pastured on the hillsides .
8.8433	Smoke curled up from kitchens and smithies .
279.3657	Gay ships sailed the waters , taking Iceland cloth and wool and Iceland fish and oil and the soft feathers of Iceland birds to Norway to sell , and bringing back wood and flour and grain .
27.9390	When Ingolf died , his men drew up on the shore the boat in which he had come to Iceland .
33.8539	They painted it freshly and put new gold on it , so that it stood there a glittering dragon with head raised high , looking over the water .
0.2774	Old Sighvat lifted a huge stone and carried it to the ship 's side .
4.6656	With all his strength he threw it into the bottom .
10.6942	The timbers cracked .
16.1645	`` If this ship moves from here , '' he said , `` then I do not know how to moor a ship .
14.2941	It is Ingolf 's grave . ''
210.9684	Then men laid Ingolf upon his shield and carried him and placed him on the high deck in the stern near the pilot 's seat where he had sat to steer to Iceland .
7.8925	They hung his sword over his shoulder .
7.5173	They laid his spear by his side .
10.4001	In his hand they put his mead-horn .
5.8192	Into the ship they set a great treasure-chest filled with beautiful clothes and bracelets and head-bands .
4.0256	Beside the treasure-chest they piled up many swords and spears and shields .
14.2622	They put gold-trimmed saddles and bridles upon three horses .
3.8284	Then they killed the horses and dragged them into the ship .
57.8291	They killed hunting-dogs and put them by the horses ; for they said : `` All these things Ingolf will need in Valhalla .
27.7218	When he walks through the door of that feast hall , Odin must know that a rich and brave man comes .
14.1439	When he fights with those heroes during the day , he must have weapons worthy of him .
7.6841	He must have dogs for the hunt .
144.7427	When he feasts with those heroes at night he must wear rich clothes , so that those feasters shall know that he was a wealthy man and generous , and that his friends loved him . ''
10.6493	Ingolf 's son tied on his hell-shoes for the long journey .
15.2420	`` If these shoes come untied , '' he said , `` I do not know how to fasten hell-shoes . ''
1.5713	Then he went out of the ship and stood on the ground with his family .
12.1919	All the men of Iceland were there .
4.3068	`` This is a glorious sight , '' they said .
6.8910	`` Surely no ship ever carried a richer load .
478.4742	Inside and out the boat blazes with gold and bronze , and , high over his riches , lies the great Ingolf , ready to take the tiller and guide to Valhalla , where all the heroes will rise up and shout him welcome . ''
4.4777	Then the thralls heaped a mound of earth over the ship .
7.9565	This hill stood up against the sky and seemed to say : `` Here lies a great man . ''
9.8871	Sighvat put a stone on the top , with runes on it telling whose grave it was .
57.5848	All this time a skald stood by and played on his harp and sang a song about that time when Ingolf came to Iceland .
13.5762	He called him the father of Iceland .
285.6671	People of that country still read an old story that the men of that long ago time wrote about Ingolf , and they love him because he was a brave man and `` the first of men to come to Iceland . ''
30.5543	It was a spring day many years after Ingolf died .
2.7358	All the freemen in the west of Iceland had come to a meeting .
4.3656	Here they made laws and punished men for having done wrong .
17.1087	The meeting was over now .
7.3255	Men were walking about the plain and talking .
11.6473	Everybody seemed much excited .
8.3278	Voices were loud , arms were swinging .
6.7551	`` It was an unjust decision , '' some one cried .
13.7573	`` Eric killed the men in fair fight .
7.1818	The judges outlawed him because they were afraid .
3.0690	His foe Thorgest has many rich and powerful men to back him . ''
6.9411	`` No , no ! ''
9.8387	said another .
15.4562	`` Eric is a bloody man .
12.0699	I am glad he is out of Iceland . ''
2.0964	Just then a big man with bushy red hair and beard stalked through the crowd .
9.7818	He looked straight ahead and scowled .
1.3814	`` There he goes , '' people said , and turned to look after him .
2.8496	`` His hands are as red as his beard , '' some said , and frowned .
12.5010	But others looked at him and smiled , saying : `` He walks like Thor the Fearless . ''
4.8501	`` His story would make a fine song , '' one said .
7.8179	`` As strong and as brave and as red as Thor !
10.2080	Always in a quarrel .
114.0176	A man of many places -- Norway , the north of Iceland , the west of Iceland , those little islands off the shore of Iceland .
4.8497	Outlawed from all of them on account of his quarrels .
13.1748	Where will he go now , I wonder ? ''
7.2531	This Eric strode down to the shore with his men following .
3.2751	`` He is in a black temper , '' they said .
5.5335	`` We should best not talk to him . ''
8.0157	So they made ready the boat in silence .
7.1862	Eric got into the pilot 's seat and they sailed off .
5.0740	Soon they pulled the ship up on their own shore .
12.1867	Eric strolled into his house and called for supper .
136.6922	When the drinking-horns had been filled and emptied , Eric pulled himself up and smiled and shouted out so that the great room was full of his big voice : `` There is no friend like mead .
7.3684	It always cheers a man 's heart . ''
7.4162	Then laughter and talking began in the hall because Eric 's good temper had come back .
3.0193	After a while Eric said : `` Well , I must off somewhere .
3.0079	I have been driven about from place to place , like a seabird in a storm .
6.2431	And there is always a storm about me .
7.8952	It is my sword 's fault .
2.2655	She is ever itching to break her peace-bands and be out and at the play .
19.0330	She has shut Norway to me and now Iceland .
9.8260	Where will you go next , old comrade ? ''
6.0589	and he pulled out his sword and looked at it and smiled as the fire flashed on it .
36.6625	`` There are some of us who will follow you wherever you go , Eric , '' called a man from across the fire .
8.4212	`` Is it so ? ''
18.0217	Eric cried , leaping up .
9.2169	`` Oh !
7.4060	then we shall have some merry times yet .
8.3577	Who will go with me ? ''
15.9525	More than half the men in the hall jumped to their feet and waved their drinking-horns and shouted : `` I !
9.2169	I ! ''
13.2349	Eric sat down in his chair and laughed .
7.4298	`` O you bloody birds of battle ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
9.7897	`` Ever hungry for new frolic !
1.4696	Our swords are sisters in blood , and we are brothers in adventure .
3.5737	Do you know what is in my heart to do ? ''
4.7414	He jumped to his feet , and his face glowed .
6.1284	Then he laughed as he looked at his men .
215.3021	`` I see the answer flashing from your eyes , '' he said , `` that you will do it even if it is to go down to Niflheim and drag up Hela , the pale queen of the stiff dead . ''
3.6976	His men pounded on the tables and shouted : `` Yes !
9.9755	Yes !
20.9909	Anywhere behind Eric ! ''
6.7142	`` But it is not to Niflheim , '' Eric laughed .
11.3917	`` Did you ever hear that story that Gunnbiorn told ?
31.1830	He was sailing for Iceland , but the fog came down , and then the wind caught him and blew him far off .
11.3809	While he drifted about he saw a strange land that rose up white and shining out of a blue sea .
3.9000	Huge ships of ice sailed out from it and met him .
6.2100	I mean to sail to that land . ''
6.4989	A great shout went up that shook the rafters .
7.3930	Then the men sat and talked over plans .
5.0714	While they sat , a stranger came into the hall .
3.1405	`` I have no time to drink , '' he said .
10.1935	`` I have a message from your friend Eyjolf .
6.6455	He says that Thorgest with all his men means to come here and catch you to-night .
25.6500	Eyjolf bids you come to him , and he will hide you until you are ready to start ; for he loves you . ''
1.7470	`` Hunted like a wolf from corner to corner of the world ! ''
22.0788	Eric cried angrily .
9.3574	`` Will they not even let me finish one feast ? ''
10.5233	Then he laughed .
8.9923	`` But if I take my sport like a wolf , I must be hunted like one .
27.5392	So we shall sleep to-night in the woods about Eyjolf 's house , comrades , instead of in these good beds .
6.4518	Well , we have done it before . ''
0.1901	`` And it is no bad place , '' cried some of the men .
7.6246	`` I always liked the stars better than a smoky house fire , '' said one .
6.3991	`` Can no bad fortune spoil your good nature ? ''
21.1922	laughed Eric .
14.7966	`` But now we are off .
6.5195	Let every man carry what he can . ''
5.3605	So they quickly loaded themselves with clothes and gold and swords and spears and kettles of food .
0.9677	Eric led his wife Thorhild and his two young sons , Thorstein and Leif .
2.8209	All together they got into the boat and went to Eyjolf 's farm .
79.3706	For a week or more they stayed in his woods , sometimes in a secret cave of his when they knew that Thorgest was about .
8.0623	And sometimes Eyjolf sent and said : `` Thorgest is off .
6.3020	Come to my house for a feast . ''
8.9888	All this time they were making ready for the voyage , repairing the ship and filling it with stores .
45.7282	Word of what Eric meant to do got out , and men laughed and said : `` Is that not like Eric ?
8.3650	What will he not do ? ''
37.7692	Some men liked the sound of it , and they came to Eric and said : `` We will go with you to this strange land . ''
18.4512	So all were ready and they pushed off with Eric 's family aboard and those friends who had joined him .
1.4956	They took horses and cattle with them , and all kinds of tools and food .
0.3556	`` I do not well know where this land is , '' Eric said .
0.6422	`` Gunnbiorn said only that he sailed east when he came home to Iceland .
9.8230	So I will steer straight west .
10.1790	We shall surely find something .
1.5439	I do not know , either , how long we must go . ''
2.0639	So they sailed that strange ocean , never dreaming what might be ahead of them .
7.3933	They found no islands to rest on .
10.4392	They met heavy fogs .
132.8191	One day as Eric sat in the pilot 's seat , he said : `` I think that I see one of Gunnbiorn 's ships of ice .
4.5315	Shall we sail up to her and see what kind of a craft she is ? ''
6.9409	`` Yes , '' shouted his men .
8.5517	So they went on toward it .
0.3959	`` It sends out a cold breath , '' said one of the men .
7.3514	They all wrapped their cloaks about them .
3.7124	`` It is a bigger boat than I ever saw before , '' said Eric .
4.1799	`` The white mast stands as high as a hill . ''
8.8823	`` It must be giants that sail in it , frost giants , '' said another of the men .
107.9103	But as they came nearer , Eric all at once laughed loudly and called out : `` By Thor , that Gunnbiorn was a foolish fellow .
10.8830	Why , look !
3.7506	It is only a piece of floating ice such as we sometimes see from Iceland .
2.0686	It is no ship , and there is no one on it . ''
13.4562	His men laughed and one called to another and said : `` And you thought of frost giants ! ''
18.5675	Then they sailed on for days and days .
8.2842	They met many of these icebergs .
12.4833	On one of them was a white bear .
10.0396	`` Yonder is a strange pilot , '' Eric laughed .
20.8719	`` I have seen bears come floating so to the north shore of Iceland , '' an old man said .
0.1835	`` Perhaps they come from the land that we are going to find . ''
26.8477	One day Eric said : `` I see afar off an iceberg larger than any one yet .
7.3057	Perhaps that is our white land . ''
8.2702	But even as he said it he felt his boat swing under his hand as he held the tiller .
0.2015	He bore hard on the rudder , but he could not turn the ship .
7.4882	`` What is this ? ''
10.4282	he cried .
7.7358	`` A strong river is running here .
5.6955	It is carrying our ship away from this land .
7.2958	I can not make head against it .
9.9911	Out with the oars ! ''
94.5743	So with oars and sail and rudder they fought against the current , but it took the boat along like a chip , and after a while they put up their oars and drifted .
2.8295	`` Luck has taken us into its own hands , '' Eric laughed .
3.2240	`` But this is as good a way as another . ''
29.2217	Sometimes they were near enough to see the land , then they were carried out into the sea and thought that they should never see any land again .
7.4226	`` Perhaps this river will carry us to a whirlpool and suck us under , '' the men said .
8.4086	But at last Eric felt the current less strong under his hand .
7.8295	`` To the oars again ! ''
9.7494	he called .
6.2135	So they fought with the current and sailed out of it and went on toward land .
1.4576	But when they reached the shore they found no place to go in .
8.2518	Steep black walls shot up from the sea .
9.6054	Nothing grew on them .
5.5106	When the men looked above the cliffs they saw a long line of white cutting the sky .
3.1270	`` It is a land of ice , '' they said .
2.0145	They sailed on south , all the time looking for a place to go ashore .
12.2368	`` I am sick of this endless sea , '' Thorhild complained , `` but this land is worse . ''
17.2850	After a while they began to see small bays cut into the shore with little flat patches of green at their sides .
2.6135	They landed in these places and stretched and warmed themselves and ate .
1.6131	`` But these spots are only big enough for graves , '' the men said .
7.1644	`` We can not live here . ''
9.6411	So they went on again .
8.1802	All the time the weather was growing colder .
3.5254	Eric 's people kept themselves wrapped in their cloaks and put scarfs around their heads .
12.1421	`` And it is still summer ! ''
19.7750	Thorhild said .
12.5309	`` What will it be in winter ? ''
44.6454	`` We must find a place to build a house now before the winter comes on , '' said Eric .
7.6703	`` We must not freeze here . ''
1.7222	So they chose a little spot with hills about it to keep off the wind .
1.5423	They made a house out of stones ; for there were many in that place .
19.6240	They lived there that winter .
5.9150	The sea for a long way out from shore froze so that it looked like white land .
3.1635	The men went out upon it to hunt white bear and seal .
2.8484	They ate the meat and wore the skins to keep them warm .
5.4012	The hardest thing was to get fuel for the fire .
10.1027	No trees grew there .
1.6262	The men found a little driftwood along the shore , but it was not enough .
1.5436	So they burned the bones and the fat of the animals they killed .
8.9378	`` It is a sickening smell , '' Thorhild said .
5.1911	`` I have not been out of this mean house for weeks .
2.7647	I am tired of the darkness and the smoke and the cattle .
10.6680	And all the time I hear great noises , as though some giant were breaking this land into pieces . ''
5.3060	`` Ah , cheer up , good wife ! ''
21.0947	Eric laughed .
8.4348	`` I smell better luck ahead . ''
13.2380	Once Eric and his men climbed the cliffs and went back into the middle of the land .
9.6931	When they came home they had this to tell : `` It is a country of ice , shining white .
7.1012	Nothing grows on it but a few mosses .
8.8086	Far off it looks flat , but when you walk upon it , there are great holes and cracks .
9.9657	We could see nothing beyond .
7.0118	There seems to be only a fringe of land around the edge of an island of ice . ''
22.9747	The winter nights were very long .
140.7512	Sometimes the sun showed for an hour , sometimes for only a few minutes , sometimes it did not show at all for a week .
1.7258	The men hunted by the bright shining of the moon or by the northern lights .
9.1941	As it grew warmer the ice in the sea began to crack and move and melt and float away .
5.7941	Eric waited only until there was a clear passage in the water .
4.0681	Then he launched his boat , and they sailed southward again .
11.7675	At last they found a place that Eric liked .
3.4318	`` Here I will build my house , '' he said .
40.1982	So they did and lived there that summer and pastured their cattle and cut hay for the winter and fished and hunted .
18.5566	The next spring Eric said : `` The land stretches far north .
5.8363	I am hungry to know what is there . ''
4.2187	Then they all got into the boat again and sailed north .
6.6329	`` We can leave no one here , '' Eric had said .
4.6840	`` We can not tell what might come between us .
7.6468	Perhaps giants or dragons or strange men might come out of this inland ice and kill our people .
9.0613	We must stay together . ''
4.5284	Farther north they found only the same bare , frozen country .
2.1016	So after a while they sailed back to their home and lived there .
224.1442	One spring after they had been in that land for four years , Eric said : `` My eyes are hungry for the sight of men and green fields again .
5.6298	My stomach is sick of seal and whale and bear .
9.4166	My throat is dry for mead .
6.2031	This is a bare and cold and hungry land .
12.2441	I will visit my friends in Iceland . ''
0.2404	`` And our swords are rusty with long resting , '' said his men .
6.8146	`` Perhaps we can find play for them in Iceland . ''
9.8700	`` Now I have a plan , '' Eric suddenly said .
7.3891	`` Would it not be pleasant to see other feast halls as we sail along the coast ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
3.5355	it would be a beautiful sight , '' his men said .
43.4891	`` Well , '' said Eric , `` I am going to try to bring back some neighbors from Iceland .
10.5266	Now we must have a name for our land .
20.8778	How does Greenland sound ? ''
24.6543	His men laughed and said : `` It is a very white Greenland , but men will like the sound of it .
15.5241	It is better than Iceland . ''
4.3318	So Eric and all his people sailed back and spent the winter with his friends .
9.2169	`` Ah !
0.3790	Eric , it is good to hear your laugh again , '' they said .
12.6311	Eric was at many feasts and saw many men , and he talked much of his Greenland .
3.0821	`` The sea is full of whale and seals and great fish , '' he said .
7.5719	`` The land has bear and reindeer .
8.4282	There are no men there .
5.0759	Come back with me and choose your land . ''
6.5656	Many men said that they would do it .
7.0977	Some men went because they thought it would be a great frolic to go to a new country .
85.9016	Some went because they were poor in Iceland and thought : `` I can be no worse off in Greenland , and perhaps I shall grow rich there . ''
2.8677	And some went because they loved Eric and wanted to be his neighbors .
31.8090	So the next summer thirty-five ships full of men and women and goods followed Eric for Greenland .
2.9323	But they met heavy storms , and some ships were wrecked , and the men drowned .
45.1329	Other men grew heartsick at the terrible storm and the long voyage and no sight of land , and they turned back to Iceland .
18.0706	So of those thirty-five ships only fifteen got to Greenland .
0.4093	`` Only the bravest and the luckiest men come here , '' Eric said .
7.5605	`` We shall have good neighbors . ''
7.5817	Soon other houses were built along the fiords .
0.6861	`` It is pleasant to sail along the coast now , '' said Eric .
7.5918	`` I see smoke rising from houses and ships standing on the shore and friendly hands waving . ''
28.9462	Now Eric had lived in Greenland for fifteen years .
0.5906	His sons Thorstein and Leif had grown up to be big , strong men .
30.0097	One spring Leif said to his father : `` I have never seen Norway , our mother land .
8.7139	I long to go there and meet the great men and see the places that skalds sing about . ''
7.6974	Eric answered : `` It is right that you should go .
7.4833	No man has really lived until he has seen Norway . ''
5.2869	So he helped Leif fit out a boat and sent him off .
27.0865	Leif sailed for months .
20.9462	He passed Iceland and the Faroes and the Shetlands .
1.5433	He stopped at all of these places and feasted his mind on the new things .
1.6656	And everywhere men received him gladly ; for he was handsome and wise .
14.6437	But at last he came near Norway .
42.4555	Then he stood up before the pilot 's seat and sang loudly : `` My eyes can see her at last , The mother of mighty men , The field of famous fights .
132.5478	In the sky above I see Fair Asgard 's shining roofs , The flying hair of Thor , The wings of Odin 's birds , The road that heroes tread .
2.8368	I am here in the land of the gods , The land of mighty men . ''
0.1988	For a while he walked the land as though he were in a dream .
5.3136	He looked at this and that and everything and loved them all because it was Norway .
3.0769	`` I will go to the king , '' he said .
7.9361	He had never seen a king .
13.9751	There were no kings in Iceland or in Greenland .
1.5522	So he went to the city where the king had his fine house .
14.4542	The king 's name was Olaf .
17.9823	He was a great-grandson of Harald Hairfair ; for Harald had been dead a hundred years .
66.2215	Now the king was going to hold a feast at night , and Leif put on his most beautiful clothes to go to it .
1.9547	He put on long tights of blue wool and a short jacket of blue velvet .
7.5342	He belted his jacket with a gold girdle .
8.1899	He had shoes of scarlet with golden clasps .
1.9534	He threw around himself a cape of scarlet velvet lined with seal fur .
6.3670	His long sword stuck out from under his cloak .
4.6652	On his head he put a knitted cap of bright colors .
0.2070	Then he walked to the king 's feast hall and went through the door .
1.9172	It was a great hall , and it was full of richly-dressed men .
301.1177	The fires shone on so many golden head-bands and bracelets and so many glittering swords and spears on the wall , and there was so much noise of talking and laughing , that at first Leif did not know what to do .
4.8867	But at last he went and sat on the very end seat of the bench near him .
148.3478	As the feast went on , King Olaf sat in his high seat and looked about the hall and noticed this one and that one and spoke across the fire to many .
8.2690	He was keen-eyed and soon saw Leif in his far seat .
1.2882	`` Yonder is some man of mark , '' he said to himself .
8.6699	`` He is surely worth knowing .
5.7979	His face is not the face of a fool .
4.7016	He carries his head like a lord of men . ''
7.0505	He sent a thrall and asked Leif to come to him .
5.6257	So Leif walked down the long hall and stood before the king .
1.4138	`` I am glad to have you for a guest , '' the king said .
6.2632	`` What are your name and country ? ''
46.4205	`` I am Leif Ericsson , and I have come all the way from Greenland to see you and old Norway . ''
9.9113	`` From Greenland ! ''
9.7419	said the king .
4.7640	`` It is not often that I see a Greenlander .
5.5833	Many come to Norway to trade , but they seldom come to the king 's hall .
6.5439	I shall be glad to hear about your land .
6.5372	Come up and speak with me . ''
19.5465	So Leif went up the steps of the high seat and sat down by the king and talked with him .
80.3587	When the feast was over the king said : `` You shall live at my court this winter , Leif Ericsson .
7.9981	You are a welcome guest . ''
29.0081	So Leif stayed there that winter .
19.2948	When he started back in the spring , the king gave him two thralls as a parting gift .
0.5312	`` Let this gift show my love , Leif Ericsson , '' he said .
9.5910	`` For your sake I shall not forget Greenland . ''
6.4463	Leif sailed back again and had good luck until he was past Iceland .
11.7360	Then great winds came out of the north and tossed his ship about so that the men could do nothing .
19.7371	They were blown south for days and days .
7.0410	They did not know where they were .
19.3290	Then they saw land , and Leif said : `` Surely luck has brought us also to a new country .
0.1860	We will go in and see what kind of a place it is . ''
9.1341	So he steered for it .
11.1380	As they came near , the men said : `` See the great trees and the soft , green shore .
3.9768	Surely this is a better country than Greenland or than Iceland either . ''
6.0579	When they landed they threw themselves upon the ground .
6.1870	`` I never lay on a bed so soft as this grass , '' one said .
6.1032	`` Taller trees do not grow in Norway , '' said another .
22.0647	`` There is no stone here as in Norway , but only good black dirt , '' Leif said .
5.2408	`` I never saw so fertile a land before . ''
5.7940	The men were hungry and set about building a fire .
2.3780	`` There is no lack of fuel here , '' they said .
3.2093	They stayed many days in this country and walked about to see what was there .
19.1966	A German , named Tyrker , was with Leif .
1.5433	He was a little man with a high forehead and a short nose .
8.5906	His eyes were big and rolling .
41.3101	He had lived with Eric for many years , and had taken care of Leif when he was a little boy .
19.0941	So Leif loved him .
41.1516	Now one day they had been wandering about and all came back to camp at night except Tyrker .
8.1551	When Leif looked around on his comrades , he said : `` Where is Tyrker ? ''
17.9456	No one knew .
19.6888	Then Leif was angry .
12.4328	`` Is a man of so little value in this empty land that you would lose one ? ''
9.8387	he said .
10.7092	`` Why did you not keep together ?
7.9142	Did you not see that he was gone ?
5.7117	Why did you not set out to look for him ?
2.0381	Who knows what terrible thing may have happened to him in these great forests ? ''
4.5591	Then he turned and started out to hunt for him .
8.3551	His men followed , silent and ashamed .
3.9816	They had not gone far when they saw Tyrker running toward them .
6.8771	He was laughing and talking to himself .
3.0322	Leif ran to him and put his arms about him with gladness at seeing him .
8.7907	`` Why are you so late ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
7.9027	`` Where have you been ? ''
4.8900	But Tyrker , still smiling and nodding his head , answered in German .
3.8554	He pointed to the woods and laughed and rolled his eyes .
24.3355	Again Leif asked his question and put his hand on Tyrker 's shoulder as though he would shake him .
55.0714	Then Tyrker answered in the language of Iceland : `` I have not been so very far , but I have found something wonderful . ''
7.4882	`` What is it ? ''
10.2641	cried the men .
19.4401	`` I have found grapes growing wild , '' answered Tyrker , and he laughed , and his eyes shone .
9.3653	`` It can not be , '' Leif said .
5.4540	Grapes do not grow in Greenland nor in Iceland nor even in Norway .
11.8312	So it seemed a wonderful thing to these Norsemen .
3.5630	`` Can I not tell grapes when I see them ? ''
16.6704	cried Tyrker .
6.6899	`` Did I not grow up in Germany , where every hillside is covered with grapevines ?
11.9894	Ah !
7.5234	it seems like my old home . ''
11.6012	`` It is wonderful , '' Leif said .
4.9615	`` I have heard travelers tell of seeing grapes growing , but I myself never saw it .
3.6576	You shall take us to them early in the morning , Tyrker . ''
0.3946	So in the morning they went back into the woods and saw the grapes .
8.6423	They ate of them .
3.4848	`` They are like food and drink , '' they cried .
6.5769	That day Leif said : `` We spent most of the summer on the ocean .
0.5881	Winter will soon be coming on and the sea about Greenland will be frozen .
9.7874	We must start back .
5.9562	I mean to take some of the things of this land to show to our people at home .
3.0067	We will fill the rowboat with grapes and tow it behind us .
4.1897	The ship we will load with logs from these great trees .
6.2583	That will be a welcome shipload in Greenland , where we have neither trees nor vines .
70.5805	Now half of you shall gather grapes for the next few days , and the other half shall cut timber . ''
13.6401	So they did , and after a week sailed off .
1.8546	The ship was full of lumber , and they towed the rowboat loaded with grapes .
43.5398	As they looked back at the shore , Leif said : `` I will call this country Wineland for the grapes that grow there . ''
214.9440	One of the men leaped upon the gunwale and leaned out , clinging to the sail , and sang : `` Wineland the good , Wineland the warm , Wineland the green , the great , the fat .
3.8674	Our dragon fed and crawls away With belly stuffed and lazy feet .
10.5703	How long her purple , trailing tail !
5.6876	She fed and grew to twice her size . ''
8.2700	Then all the men waved their hands to the shore and gave a great shout for that good land .
19.7097	For all that voyage they had fair weather and sailed into Eric 's harbor before the winter came .
9.5065	Eric saw the ship and ran down to the shore .
24.3611	He took Leif into his arms and said : `` Oh , my son , my old eyes ached to see you .
1.6213	I hunger to hear of all that you have seen and done . ''
5.3013	`` Luck has followed me all the way , '' said Leif .
6.2926	`` See what I have brought home . ''
18.7071	The Greenlanders looked .
11.2286	`` Lumber !
11.1600	lumber ! ''
10.4282	they cried .
9.2169	`` Oh !
8.0648	it is better stuff than gold . ''
6.7622	Then they saw the grapes and tasted them .
3.1891	`` Surely you must have plundered Asgard , '' they said , smacking their lips .
27.2108	At the feast that night Eric said : `` Leif shall sit in the place of honor . ''
18.8961	So Leif sat in the high seat opposite Eric .
9.7555	All men thought him a handsome and wise man .
9.7992	He told them of the storm and of Wineland .
6.3096	`` No man would ever need a cloak there .
12.4168	The soil is richer than the soil of Norway .
1.9189	Grain grows wild , and you yourselves saw the grapes that we got from there .
9.0589	The forests are without end .
7.5716	The sea is full of fish . ''
11.0908	The Greenlanders listened with open mouths to all this .
3.8281	They turned and talked to Leif 's ship-comrades who were scattered among them .
51.4324	Leif noticed two strangers , an old man who sat at Eric 's side and a young woman on the cross-bench .
7.2091	He turned to his brother Thorstein who sat next to him .
7.9190	`` Who are these strangers ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
19.1063	`` Thorbiorn and his daughter Gudrid , '' Thorstein answered .
29.2579	`` They landed here this spring .
0.2887	I never saw our father more glad of anything than to see this Thorbiorn .
14.3983	They were friends before we left Iceland .
0.2273	When they saw each other again they could not talk enough of old times .
4.6648	In the spring Eric means to give him a farm up the fiord a way .
40.9663	It seems that this Thorbiorn comes of a good family that has been rich and great in Iceland for years .
8.3359	And Thorbiorn himself was rich when our father knew him , and was much honored by all men .
6.1476	But ill luck came , and he grew poor .
8.8143	This hurt his pride . '
7.2565	I will not stay in Iceland and be a beggar , ' he said to himself . '
8.8386	I will not have men look at me and say , `` He is not what his father was . ''
8.4562	I will go to my friend Eric the Red in Greenland . '
1.5513	`` Then he got ready a great feast and invited all his friends .
4.1379	It was such a feast as had not been in Iceland for years .
7.2499	Thorbiorn spent on it all the wealth that he had left .
1.3411	For he said to himself , ' I will not leave in shame .
8.4457	Men shall remember my last feast . '
9.5752	After that he set out and came to Greenland .
13.3340	`` Is not Gudrid beautiful ?
9.0127	And she is wise .
1.4007	I mean to marry her , if her father will permit it . ''
9.9942	Now Leif settled down in Greenland and became a great man there .
17.6315	He was so busy and he grew so rich that he did not think of going to Wineland again .
7.7219	But people could not forget his story .
21.6776	Many nights as men sat about the long fires they talked of that wonderful land and wished to see it .
320.3646	On an autumn , a year or two after Leif came home , Eric and his men saw two large ships come to land not far down the shore from the house .
9.3427	`` They look like trading ships , '' Eric said .
5.0823	`` Let us go down to see them . ''
8.3661	`` I will go , too , '' Gudrid said .
6.4156	`` Perhaps they will have rich cloth and jewelry .
1.4997	It is long since I had my eyes on a new dress . ''
3.4955	So they all went down and found two large trading ships lying in the water .
3.9340	A great many men were on the shore making a fire .
15.7527	`` Welcome to Greenland ! ''
19.6939	called Eric .
5.2448	`` What are your names and your country ? ''
9.6195	Then a fine , big man walked out from among the men and went up to Eric .
4.0547	`` I am Thorfinn , '' he said , `` a trader .
0.9298	I sailed this summer from Iceland with forty men and a shipload of goods .
9.2890	On the sea I met this other ship from Iceland .
17.4860	The master is Biarni .
7.2711	Come and look at my goods . ''
3.6162	So he rowed Eric and Gudrid out and they went aboard his boat .
11.2989	Thorfinn opened his chests and showed Eric gleaming swords and bracelets and axes and farm tools .
1.9535	But before Gudrid he spread beautiful cloth and gold embroidery and golden necklaces .
0.5545	As they looked , he told of doings in Iceland and asked of Greenland .
48.5353	`` We never see such things as these in this bare land , '' Gudrid said , as she smoothed a beautiful dress of purple velvet .
7.9440	`` I envy the women of Iceland their fair clothes . ''
47.1712	`` There is no need of that , '' Thorfinn said , `` for this dress is yours and anything else from my chests that you like .
5.0529	Here is a necklace that I beg you to take .
0.3931	It did not have a fairer mistress in Greece where I got it . ''
7.1462	`` You are a very generous trader , '' Gudrid said .
16.6598	Then Thorfinn gave Eric a great sword with a gold-studded scabbard .
8.9534	After a while he took them to Biarni 's ship .
8.6857	He also gave them gifts .
5.1065	They all talked and laughed much while they were together .
11.0075	`` You are merry comrades , '' Eric said .
5.4760	`` I ask you both and all your men to spend the winter at my house .
5.7936	You can put your goods into my storehouses . ''
9.7715	`` By my sword !
16.6684	a generous offer , '' said Thorfinn .
3.2338	`` As for me , I am happy to come . ''
10.7567	Biarni and all the rest said the same thing .
83.5825	Thorfinn walked to the house with Eric and Gudrid , while the other men sailed to the ship-sheds and pulled their boats under them .
8.0083	Then Thorfinn saw to the unloading and storing of his goods .
10.7299	`` Is this Gudrid your daughter ? ''
35.8885	he asked of Eric one day .
3.5292	`` She is the widow of my son Thorstein , '' Eric said .
12.7130	`` He died the same winter that they were married .
6.4603	Her father , too , died not long ago .
12.3784	So Gudrid lives with me . ''
14.9002	Now all that winter until Yule-time Eric spread a good feast every night .
6.6905	There was laughter through his house all the time .
12.2333	Often at the feasts the men cast lots to see whether they might sit on the cross-bench with the women .
14.4959	Sometimes it was Thorfinn 's luck to sit by Gudrid .
8.9703	Then they talked gaily and drank together .
10.4129	At last Yule was coming near .
16.3154	Eric went about the house gloomy then .
57.8300	One day Thorfinn put his hand on Eric 's shoulder and said : `` Something is troubling you , Eric .
0.2116	We have all noticed that you are not gay as you used to be .
6.7510	Tell me what is the matter . ''
3.3144	`` You have carried yourselves like noble men in my house , '' Eric answered .
5.7246	`` I am proud to have you for guests .
0.4727	Now I am ashamed that you should not find a house worthy of you .
188.2397	I am ashamed that when you leave me you will have to say that you never spent a worse Yule than you did with Eric the Red in Greenland .
8.6286	For my cupboards are empty . ''
6.5224	`` Oh , that is easily mended , '' Thorfinn said .
3.0447	`` No house could feed eighty men so long and not feel it .
7.8908	I never knew so generous a host before .
3.8612	But I have flour and grain and mead in my boat .
6.5721	You are welcome to all of it .
4.0216	You have only to open the doors of your own storehouses .
7.7412	It is a little gift . ''
29.8654	So Eric used those things , and there was never a merrier Yule feast than in his house that winter .
26.2376	When Yule was over , Thorfinn said to Eric : `` Gudrid is a beautiful and wise woman .
5.2235	I wish to have her for my wife . ''
0.3435	`` You seem to be a man worthy of her , '' Eric said .
0.7675	So that winter Gudrid and Thorfinn were married and lived at Eric 's house .
70.5071	One day Thorfinn said to Eric : `` I have heard much of this wonderful Wineland since I have been here .
4.3131	It seems to me that it is worth while to go and see more of it . ''
5.2288	`` My son Thorstein and I tried it once , '' said Eric .
20.6340	`` It was the year after Leif came back .
35.7827	We set out with a fair ship and with glad hearts , but we tossed about all summer on the sea and got nowhere .
11.6339	We were wet with storm , lean with hunger and illness , and heartsick at our bad luck . ''
5.8807	`` And yet , '' Thorfinn said , `` another time we might have better weather .
0.2041	I have never seen so fair a land as this seems to be . ''
9.2550	Then he went to Leif and talked long with him .
29.7345	Leif told him in what direction he had sailed to come home , and how the shores looked that he had passed .
4.6614	`` I think I could find my way , '' Thorfinn said .
4.7535	`` My heart moves me to try this frolic . ''
11.6087	He spoke to Gudrid about it .
6.9411	`` Oh , yes ! ''
10.4282	she cried .
9.2651	`` Let us go .
4.2802	It is long since I felt a boat leaping under me .
9.4357	I am tired of sitting still .
91.9046	I want to feel the warm days and see the soft grass and the high trees and taste the grapes of this Wineland the Good . ''
10.9364	Then he talked with his men and with Biarni .
4.7876	`` We are ready , '' they all said .
5.2333	`` We are only waiting for a leader . ''
7.9514	`` Then let us go ! ''
21.0516	cried Thorfinn .
22.3739	So in the spring they fitted up their two ships and put into them provisions and a few cattle .
269.8063	Some of Eric 's men also got ready a boat , so that three ships set sail from Eric 's harbor carrying one hundred and sixty men to Wineland .
126.4119	As they started , Gudrid stood on the deck and sang : `` I will feast my eyes on new things -- On mighty trees and purple grapes , On beds of flowers and soft grass .
5.7874	I will sun myself in a warm land . ''
7.4014	They sailed on and past those shores that Leif had spoken of .
1.8575	Whenever they saw any interesting place they sailed in and looked about and rested there .
508.7543	They had gone far south , past many fair shores with woods on them , when Gudrid said one day : `` This is a beautiful bay with a smooth , green field by it , and the great mountains far back .
4.3218	I should like to stay there for a little while . ''
3.9852	So they sailed in and drew their ships up on shore .
7.0755	They put up the awnings in them .
8.1842	`` These shall be our houses , '' Thorfinn said .
2.1649	They were strange-looking houses -- shining dragons with gay backs lying on the yellow sand .
10.2475	Near them the Norsemen lighted fires and cooked their supper .
17.2001	That night they slept in the ships .
16.2253	In the morning Gudrid said : `` I long to see what is back of that mountain . ''
8.8030	So they all climbed it .
1.6331	When they stood on the top they could see far over the country .
2.5229	`` There is a lake that we must see , '' Thorfinn said .
3.6201	`` I should like to sail around that bay , '' said Biarni , pointing .
8.2024	`` I am going to walk up that valley yonder , '' one of the men said .
4.0255	And everyone saw some place where he would like to go .
17.9362	So for all that summer they camped in that spot and went about the country seeing new things .
1.8951	They hunted in the woods and caught rabbits and birds and sometimes bears and deer .
17.1293	Every day some men rowed out to sea and fished .
0.2271	There was an island in the bay where thousands of birds had their nests .
10.0288	The men gathered eggs here .
74.6005	`` We have more to eat than we had in Greenland or Iceland , '' Thorfinn said , `` and need not work at all .
7.7620	It is all play . ''
26.9781	Near the end of summer Thorfinn spoke to his comrades .
7.6141	`` Have we not seen everything here ?
7.5768	Let us go to a new place .
7.7245	We have not yet found grapes . ''
13.6951	Thorfinn and Biarni and all their men sailed south again .
2.7558	But some of Eric 's men went off in their boat another way .
0.8438	Years afterward the Greenlanders heard that they were shipwrecked and made slaves in Ireland .
19.2965	After Thorfinn and Biarni had sailed for many days they landed on a low , green place .
8.5242	There were hills around it .
9.4211	A little lake was there .
7.1065	`` What is growing on those hillsides ? ''
12.0645	Thorfinn said , shading his eyes with his hand .
7.6989	He and some others ran up there .
8.2469	The people on shore heard them shout .
4.5630	Soon they came running back with their hands full of something .
11.1215	`` Grapes !
11.0529	Grapes ! ''
9.6954	they were shouting .
6.8328	All those people sat down and ate the grapes and then went to the hillside and picked more .
9.1408	`` Now we are indeed in Wineland , '' they said .
11.2579	`` It is as wonderful as Leif 's stories .
5.3167	Surely we must stay here for a long time . ''
4.5695	The very next day they went into the woods and began to cut out lumber .
7.3073	The huts that they built were little things .
4.7760	They had no windows , and in the doorways the men hung their cloaks instead of doors .
58.2103	`` We can be out in the air so much in this warm country , '' said Gudrid , `` that we do not need fine houses . ''
24.2154	The huts were scattered all about , some on the side of the lake , some at the shore of the harbor , some on the hillside .
54.7319	Gudrid had said : `` I want to live by the lake where I can look into the green woods and hear sweet bird-noises . ''
18.1440	So Thorfinn built his hut there .
89.5551	As they sat about the campfire one night , Biarni said : `` It is strange that so good a land should be empty .
0.6090	I suppose that these are the first houses that were ever built in Wineland .
1.8672	It is wonderful to think that we are alone here in this great land . ''
19.7769	All that winter no snow fell .
9.1260	The cattle pastured on the grass .
7.1310	`` To think of the cold , frozen winters in Greenland ! ''
19.7750	Gudrid said .
9.2169	`` Oh !
6.1388	this is the sun 's own land . ''
5.3446	In the beginning of that winter a little son was born to Gudrid and Thorfinn .
17.7986	`` A health to the first Winelander ! ''
8.8918	the men shouted and drank down their wine ; for they had made some from Wineland grapes .
2.7018	`` Will he be the father of a great country , as Ingolf was ? ''
21.4342	Biarni mused .
8.7597	Gudrid looked at her baby and smiled .
4.0970	`` You will be as sunny as this good land , I hope , '' she said .
9.8288	They named him Snorri .
26.2170	He grew fast and soon crept along the yellow sand , and toddled among the grapevines , and climbed into the boats and learned to talk .
5.6611	The men called him the `` Wineland king . ''
0.3685	`` I never knew a baby before , '' one of the men said .
6.8322	`` No , '' said another .
10.0147	`` Swords are jealous .
7.6555	But when they are in their scabbards , we can do other things , even play with babies . ''
13.0992	`` I wonder whether I have forgotten how to swing my sword in this quiet land , '' another man said .
116.4907	One spring morning when the men got up and went out from their huts to the fires to cook they saw a great many canoes in the harbor .
8.6987	Men were in them paddling toward shore .
7.4882	`` What is this ? ''
21.1815	cried the Norsemen to one another .
9.0275	`` Where did they come from ?
9.8130	Are they foes ?
10.6397	Who ever saw such boats before ?
7.3156	The men 's faces are brown . ''
6.2488	`` Let every man have his sword ready , '' cried Thorfinn .
6.8200	`` But do not draw until I command .
7.2042	Let us go to meet them . ''
6.9566	So they went and stood on the shore .
3.2114	Soon the men from the canoes landed and stood looking at the Norsemen .
8.7450	The strangers ' skin was brown .
9.7565	Their faces were broad .
9.6222	Their hair was black .
9.3589	Their bodies were short .
10.6384	They wore leather clothes .
13.7007	One man among them seemed to be chief .
10.4223	He spread out his open hands to the Norsemen .
0.3168	`` He is showing us that he has no weapons , '' Biarni said .
7.4827	`` He comes in peace . ''
3.1484	Then Thorfinn showed his empty hands and asked : `` What do you want ? ''
7.5144	The stranger said something , but the Norsemen could not understand .
8.0888	It was some new language .
3.0235	Then the chief pointed to one of the huts and walked toward it .
37.8564	He and his men walked all around it and felt of the timber and went into it and looked at all the things there -- spades and cloaks and drinking-horns .
8.7024	As they looked they talked together .
2.7365	They went to all the other huts and looked at everything there .
14.7610	One of them found a red cloak .
4.0162	He spread it out and showed it to the others .
2.7861	They all stood about it and looked at it and felt of it and talked fast .
7.0712	`` They seem to like my cloak , '' Biarni said .
67.6272	One of the strangers went down to their canoes and soon came back with an armload of furs -- fox-skins , otter-skins , beaver-skins .
5.1552	The chief took some and held them out to Thorfinn and hugged the cloak to him .
10.2526	`` He wants to trade , '' Thorfinn said .
12.1858	`` Will you do it , Biarni ? ''
6.4621	`` Yes , '' Biarni answered , and took the furs .
52.5694	`` If they want red stuff , I have a whole roll of red cloth that I will trade , '' one of the other men said .
8.0553	He went and got it .
3.5994	When the strangers saw it they quickly held out more furs and seemed eager to trade .
8.5654	So Thorfinn cut the cloth into pieces and sold every scrap .
1.7980	When the strangers got it they tied it about their heads and seemed much pleased .
56.8130	While this trading was going on and everybody was good-natured , a bull of Thorfinn 's ran out of the woods bellowing and came towards the crowd .
29.8660	When the strangers heard it and saw it they threw down whatever was in their hands and ran to their canoes and paddled off as fast as they could .
19.3585	The Norsemen laughed .
8.2729	`` We have lost our customers , '' Biarni said .
5.6143	`` Did they never see a bull before ? ''
17.2490	laughed one of the men .
12.9938	Now after three weeks the Norsemen saw canoes in the bay again .
2.8724	This time it was black with them , there were so many .
4.6750	The people in them were all making a horrible shout .
6.9308	`` It is a war-cry , '' Thorfinn said , and he raised a red shield .
3.5558	`` They are surely twenty to our one , but we must fight .
1.4663	Stand in close line and give them a taste of your swords . ''
3.2062	Even as he spoke a great shower of stones fell upon them .
4.6593	Some of the Norsemen were hit on the head and knocked down .
18.8530	Biarni got a broken arm .
10.0225	Still the storm came fast .
9.4875	The strangers had landed and were running toward the Norsemen .
2.1536	They threw their stones with sling-shots , and they yelled all the time .
1.4835	`` Oh , this is no kind of fighting for brave men ! ''
22.0788	Thorfinn cried angrily .
59.9267	The Norsemen 's swords swung fast , and many of the strangers died under them , but still others came on , throwing stones and swinging stone axes .
0.4722	The horrible yelling and the strange things that the savages did frightened the Norsemen .
8.1551	`` These are not men , '' some one cried .
3.3049	Then those Norsemen who had never been afraid of anything turned and ran .
15.9435	But when they came to the top of a rough hill Thorfinn cried : `` What are we doing ?
0.4179	Shall we die here in this empty land with no one to bury us ?
7.2770	We are leaving our women . ''
0.4198	Then one of the women ran out of the hut where they were hiding .
7.3497	`` Give me a sword ! ''
10.4282	she cried .
7.7571	`` I can drive them back .
16.0200	Are Norsemen not better than these savages ? ''
46.4867	Then those warriors stopped , ashamed , and stood up before the wild men and fought so fiercely that the strangers turned and fled down to their canoes and paddled away .
4.2566	`` Oh , I am glad they are gone ! ''
19.7750	Thorfinn said .
7.0520	`` It was an ugly fight . ''
7.5766	`` Thor would not have loved that battle , '' one said .
4.8108	`` It was no battle , '' another replied .
3.0486	`` It was like fighting against an army of poisonous flies . ''
12.3982	The Norsemen were all worn and bleeding and sore .
1.4416	They went to their huts and dressed their wounds , and the women helped them .
4.2152	At supper that night they talked about the fight for a long time .
9.0981	`` I will not stay here , '' Gudrid said .
8.5174	`` Perhaps these wild men have gone away to get more people and will come back and kill us .
9.9755	Oh !
9.0775	they are ugly . ''
53.6818	`` Perhaps brown faces are looking at us now from behind the trees in the woods back there , '' said Biarni .
5.4258	It was the wish of all to go home .
16.0945	So after a few days they sailed back to Greenland with good weather all the way .
5.3206	The people at Eric 's house were very glad to see them .
3.4316	`` We were afraid you had died , '' they said .
12.6248	`` And I thought once that we should never leave Wineland alive , '' Thorfinn answered .
7.9859	Then they told all the story .
0.4079	`` I wonder why I had no such bad luck , '' Leif said .
3.6782	`` But you have a better shipload than I got . ''
1.5485	He was looking at the bundles of furs and the kegs of wine .
12.7733	`` Yes , '' said Thorfinn , `` we have come back richer than when we left .
0.1914	But I will never go again for all the skins in the woods . ''
79.9674	The next summer Thorfinn took Gudrid and Snorri and all his people and sailed back to Iceland , his home .
7.8756	There he lived until he died .
8.5862	People looked at him in wonder .
10.9181	`` That is the man who went to Wineland and fought with wild men , '' they said .
8.8753	`` Snorri is his son .
14.5647	He is the first and last Winelander , for no one will ever go there again .
5.8371	It will be an empty and forgotten land . ''
7.1903	And so it was for a long time .
66.3353	Some wise men wrote down the story of those voyages and of that land , and people read the tale and liked it , but no one remembered where the place was .
7.8329	It all seemed like a fairy tale .
5.4416	Long afterwards , however , men began to read those stories with wide-open eyes and to wonder .
9.5466	They guessed and talked together , and studied this and that land , and read the story over and over .
677.1910	At last they have learned that Wineland was in America , on the eastern shore of the United States , and they have called Snorri the first American , and have put up statues of Leif Ericsson , the first comer to America .
20.8160	`` All here now , Paul ! ''
3.6421	`` Call the roll , somebody , wo n't you ? ''
7.3236	`` Keep quiet , fellows , please ! ''
10.8621	`` Shall I strike a match , Paul ? ''
7.8651	`` Not on your life , Bobolink .
7.3871	That crowd of Ted Slavin 's is out , looking for us .
8.1643	Somebody must have leaked , or else Ted was tipped off .
12.6816	We 've got to be mighty cautious , I tell you , if we want to give them the slip . ''
28.2018	`` S-s-say , d-d-don ' t you k-k-know we 've got a fi-fine b-b-barn on our p-p-place , fellows ? ''
228.0949	`` For goodness sake ; wo n't somebody please pound Bluff Shipley on the back , and make him bite his twisted tongue , so he can talk straight ? ''
10.9209	cried a pleading voice .
9.5061	`` Listen ! ''
734.1579	There must have been a streak of authority in the tone used by Paul Morrison when he spoke this last word ; every one of the other six boys crouched there , craning his neck , and listening to catch the unusual sound that had apparently reached the trained ears of their leader .
3.4990	The woods surrounded the boys on all sides , gloomy , and full of mystifying noises .
4.8247	Yet Paul knew full well just what every one of the sounds meant .
4.5114	An owl called mournfully to its mate from a hollow tree .
15.5080	Katydids and merry crickets added their shrill music to the chorus of that late summer night .
1.9175	Even a colony of tree frogs solemnly chanted their appeal for `` more rain . ''
346.1460	During the day just ended six fellows in the thriving town of Stanhope had received urgent telephone calls from Paul , who was an only son of the leading doctor in the place .
74.9003	And each boy had promised to meet him at the Three Oaks by the time the clock in the church steeple had struck eight .
23.9560	It was even now booming out the hour .
4.1639	When the last stroke died away , the most impatient among the gathered boys moved restlessly .
6.4819	`` Follow me , fellows , '' said Paul , in a low , thrilling tone .
7.8858	`` Where are we heading for ? ''
3.6268	queried one , who had as yet failed to express his feelings in the matter .
581.7670	This was Wallace Carberry , the sober member of the pair known far and wide as the Carberry Twins ; his mate , William , being his exact counterpart in every particular , when he chose to repress the good-natured grin that usually marked his fate .
3.0379	`` To the Shipley barn ; single file ; and silence is the watchword ! ''
16.8660	Paul Morrison had long enjoyed the confidence of his comrades in most matters pertaining to outdoor sports .
193.0933	A healthy lad , both in mind and body , he was never so happy as when studying the secrets of Nature in wood and meadow ; or in playing any of the various strenuous games to which all boys with red blood in their veins are addicted .
223.3489	And when he sent out his mysterious request that some of his most intimate friends meet him on this night , as he had a communication of importance to put up to them , the greatest curiosity made itself manifest .
20.1393	Paul never suggested ordinary things .
451.8322	More than once he had engineered some game that brought honor and glory to the boys of Stanhope ; and remembering these satisfactory `` stunts '' of old , it was no wonder these fellows had come to the place of meeting without a single exception .
836.5479	With Bluff Shipley close upon the heels of the leader , and Robert Oliver Link , whose name had long since been corrupted into Bobolink , bringing up the rear , the seven lads trailed through the woods , following some path with which they were evidently more or less familiar .
571.4912	Several times Paul gave a recognized signal that caused every one of the bunch to stop short , and turn his head on one side in the endeavor to discover whether hostile footsteps could be heard in their rear .
20.2233	But although there were doubtless many rustling sounds , the boys laid these to the bright-eyed little denizens of that strip of woodland .
59.8640	Too often had they watched the chipmunks and red squirrels hunting for nuts under the already falling leaves , not to know that the forest was peopled with these harmless animals .
106.8312	After five minutes more there loomed up before them the dark outlines of a huge barn that seemed rather out of place here on the border of the woods .
143.4952	This belonged to the father of Bluff , who , being a prosperous tobacco grower in this valley , used the place to cure the product of his broad fields , after it had been harvested in the fall .
34.8794	Paul had been carrying some sort of package in his hand , and the boys for some time amused themselves in guessing its nature .
3.5472	When he took off the paper it stood revealed as a lantern , ready for lighting .
7.3070	`` Show us the way inside , Bluff .
400.0431	Then we 'll have a little light on the subject , '' remarked the leader , with a last anxious searching look around ; as though he still entertained suspicions that their march to the old barn might have been observed by some of the hostile Slavin crowd .
167.7802	Ted Slavin had long been known as the bully of Stanhope ; for it seems that there never yet existed a village or town without some big chap exercising that privilege .
3.2097	He was a fighter , too , and able to hold his own against the best .
148.1697	Besides , Ted had shown some of the qualities that indicate a natural leader ; though he held the allegiance of those who trailed after him mostly through fear , rather than any respect for his manly qualities .
170.7781	His leading crony for the past year had been Ward Kenwood , son of the wealthy banker who was also a leading real estate owner in the place .
900.7056	Once upon a time Ward would have scorned the thought of associating with Slavin and his crowd ; but an occasion had arisen whereby he had need of a strong arm to even up a score , and once he found himself indebted to Ted he kept on in the bully 's company .
26.7003	His rivalry in many fields with Paul had much to do with his throwing his fortunes in with the other fellows .
5.4600	And nothing pleased him more than to be able to upset any calculations the latter entertained .
206.0295	That explained why Paul was anxious to avoid a meeting with the Slavin crowd on this particular night , when he was brimming over with a great idea .
23.2074	Once the boys had entered the barn , Bluff secured the door , after which a match was quickly lighted .
5.8172	`` Now , here we are , safe and sound , and not an enemy around .
297.1705	Suppose you open up , Paul , and get this load off our minds , '' said Albert Cypher , who seldom heard his own name among his friends , but was known far and wide as Nuthin ' .
115.8008	But what else could a lad expect who was so unfortunate as to find himself afflicted with such a name as A. Cypher ?
7.1059	`` Yes , what 's it all mean , Paul ?
384.8857	You have n't even taken me in , you know , and I 'm as much in the dark as the next fellow , '' remarked Jack Stormways , reproachfully ; for being Paul 's closest chum he might have expected to share his confidence .
9.5276	`` Wait a bit .
2.9100	We might as well make ourselves comfortable while we 're about it .
5.7249	I 'll sit down on this box , and the rest of you gather around on the floor .
3.0264	I 've got a big proposition to make , and you want to listen carefully . ''
270.7375	`` T-t-take c-c-care of the lantern , f-f-fellows ; my d-d-dad 's w-w-wanting this old barn f-f-for his t-t-tobacco crop , and he 'd b-b-be some put out if it b-b-burned just now ! ''
10.7033	came from Bluff .
150.4705	Finding perches on various low piles of waste left over after the shipment of the last crop , the six lads gathered around Paul , eagerness stamped on every beaming face .
6.6918	`` Now , what 's the idea that struck you this time , Paul ? ''
12.1114	demanded Bobolink .
3.0012	`` I 'll tell you without any beating around the bush , fellows .
5.3307	The thought came to me that Stanhope was away behind the times .
3.7866	Other towns not nearly so big , have one or more troops of Boy Scouts .
13.7696	Why should n't we get up one here ? ''
9.5581	and Paul waited to hear what the response would be .
9.8661	The six who sat in a ring looked at each other as though stunned by the proposal .
28.8817	It was strange , indeed , that no one had up to this time taken a lead in advancing such a thing .
16.5722	`` Bully idea , Paul ! ''
20.8852	ejaculated Jack , slapping a hand on his knee enthusiastically , as though it appealed to him most decidedly .
5.1513	`` Well , I declare , to think that nobody ever mentioned such a grand movement before .
6.7070	Count me in right from the start ! ''
19.7665	said Wallace Carberry -- sober Wallace , who usually measured his words as though they were golden .
7.2514	`` And me too , '' observed Bobolink .
18.4737	`` Ditto for William ! ''
14.8352	called out the other Carberry Twin , grinning with delight .
9.4226	`` G-g-guess I 'd make a bully good t-t-tenderfoot ! ''
8.9233	`` That 's the best thing you ever thought up , old chap , '' came from Nuthin ' .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
10.5520	every county heard from , and not one contrary word .
112.2631	It looks as if there might be something doing right soon around this region , '' declared Paul , naturally pleased because his proposition had met with such unanimous satisfaction .
6.6902	`` Tell us more about it , please .
20.6701	I 've read about the Boy Scouts ; but my mother would take a fit if she thought I was practicing to become a soldier .
306.6848	You see , I had an older brother , who enlisted to go out with some of the boys when we had our little fuss about Cuba and the Philippines ; and poor Frank died in camp of typhoid fever .
12.6476	I 'll have a hard time winning her over , and the dad , too , '' remarked Bobolink , sadly .
1.4631	`` Well , that 's where you make a big mistake , Bobolink .
360.8237	Over in England , where the Boy Scout movement started , it has some connection with the army , because there , you see , every fellow expects at some time to serve his country as a soldier , or on board a naval vessel .
7.1837	But here in America , the movement is one for peace . ''
5.2365	`` Then what 's all the doings about ? ''
8.6378	asked Nuthin ' , as if puzzled .
70.3611	`` I know , and Paul is right about it , '' came from Wallace Carberry , always quite a reader of newspapers and magazines .
9.1739	`` Let him tell then .
1.9167	I 'm for the game , no matter what it means , '' cried Bobolink .
34.4963	`` And I think Bluff knows something about it , for he said he would do for the lowest grade of scout , which is the tenderfoot .
1514.1026	But I do n't think any of you are qualified to take even that degree ; for a tenderfoot must first be familiar with scout law , sign , salute , and know what his badge means ; he must know about our national flag , and the usual forms of salute due to it ; and be able to tie some seven or eight common knots .
17.6959	How about that , Bluff ? ''
14.3586	`` N-n-not guilty ! ''
19.3067	promptly answered the one addressed .
7.1150	`` Say , that sounds interesting any way .
9.9265	Tell us some more about this , Paul ! ''
4.1130	exclaimed William , always eager to hear of anything that smacked of novelty .
45.7885	`` Well , there are two more degrees a fellow can climb up to , a second-class scout , and a first-class scout , full fledged .
346.1128	After that , if he wants to keep right on there are merit badges to be won for excelling in angling , athletics , camping , cooking at the campfire , taxidermy , first aid to the injured , handicraft , life saving , path-finding , and a lot more . ''
9.8907	`` Now you 've got me stuck on this new game , '' cried Bobolink , excitedly .
3.8825	`` The more you explain the better I like the idea .
7.4230	Me for the Boy Scouts , fellows ! ''
10.2032	`` Hear !
11.0430	Hear !
180.5094	Paul , the idea is yours , and we vote unanimously that you occupy the exalted position of scout master -- I know that every troop has to have such a head , and you 're better fitted for the job than any fellow in town ! ''
75.3922	`` Yes , '' laughed Paul , `` but unfortunately , I believe a scout master has to be over twenty-one years of age . ''
8.1789	`` Who knows the ways of the open like our Paul ?
5.7836	He 's the right man in the right place .
14.4617	Say , are there any books on the subject , that we can get , and learn more about this thing ? ''
11.2375	asked Wallace , who seemed to be particularly well pleased .
14.2851	`` I 've already sent for a manual , and expect it by to-morrow ; when we can find out all about it .
83.1964	But wishing to be posted when I put the question I went over the river to Aldine to-day , and saw some of the boys there who belong to the Scouts .
3.4658	They made me more anxious than ever to start a patrol in our home town . ''
4.4876	`` But I 've seen something about a troop ? ''
23.2600	remarked Jack Stormways , who , Paul thought , seemed unusually sober for a boy ordinarily light-hearted .
34.8510	`` Yes , a troop takes in say , three local posts called patrols , each of which has eight members .
79.4049	It is known by a number , as Troop One of Boston ; and each minor organization takes a name of some animal , such as wildcat or fox .
132.6221	If it is called Fox , every boy belonging to it is supposed to be able to bark like a fox , so as to be able to signal a comrade while scouting in the woods . ''
11.2420	`` Ginger !
12.5706	but that does sound interesting , '' declared William .
8.1253	`` It 's j-j-just immense , that 's w-w-what ! ''
9.8785	was Bluff 's opinion .
10.3587	`` Listen !
6.3317	I heard a laugh as sure as anything ! ''
36.4078	exclaimed Paul , lifting a hand to indicate silence ; and every one of the group assumed an attitude of expectancy .
19.9719	As they waited there suddenly came a tremendous crash , as some object landed forcibly against the wooden side of the old barn .
103.8349	It was instantly followed by a second bang , and others came quick and fast , until the noise might be likened to a bombardment from a hostile battery .
9.8618	`` It 's the Slavin crowd ! ''
8.0825	called Bobolink , excitedly jumping to his feet .
2.4615	`` They followed us here after all , and have been listening to every word ! ''
8.2414	`` All hands to repel boarders ! ''
92.7185	shouted Paul ; and with a cheer the seven boys rushed over to the door , out of which they sprang , bent on retaliating on their tormentors .
8.5263	`` Where are the stone throwers ? ''
94.0630	shouted the merry member of the Carberry Twins , as he danced up and down , eagerly trying to discover some moving object in the surrounding darkness .
128.4019	`` Gone like smoke , I guess , '' laughed Paul , who had really expected something of this sort , judging from past experiences with these same tormentors .
5.4659	`` Look there , I can see something moving yonder .
8.2512	Get ready to give a volley ! ''
7.6877	cried Nuthin ' , pointing as he spoke .
8.4807	`` H-h-hold on , f-f-fellows , d-d-don ' t fire yet !
9.4448	It 's only our old d-d-dun cow ! ''
27.8682	gasped Bluff , excitedly ; as he waved his arms up and down after the manner of a cheer captain at a college football game .
16.4466	`` They 've lit out , that 's what , '' grumbled William , who felt as though cheated .
8.7516	`` All right , then .
16.7523	It 's just as well , for a fight would be a mighty poor way of preparing to join the scout movement .
115.1471	You 'll learn what I mean later on when you hear the twelve points of the law that every fellow must subscribe to , '' observed Paul , seriously .
13.4386	`` What d'ye mean , Paul ? ''
11.0922	demanded Bobolink , quickly .
11.4894	`` Yes , tell us right now what the twelve rules are , '' said William .
49.8131	`` I know , for I read all about them a few days ago , '' remarked Wallace , readily .
3.5043	`` All right , then , suppose you call them off .
7.7925	What does a scout promise to be if allowed to wear the uniform , Wallace ? ''
10.1373	asked the leader .
45.2152	`` To be trustworthy , loyal , helpful to others , friendly , courteous , kind , obedient to his superiors , cheerful , thrifty , brave , clean and reverent . ''
1.5420	`` Why , it does n't say a single word about fighting ! ''
21.5796	ejaculated William .
37.3050	`` Because a scout must never fight save as a last resort , and then only to save some weak one from punishment .
16.0361	He must be brave to face danger , to stop a runaway horse ; or jump in and keep another from drowning .
1.4487	Do you get on to the meaning of this movement , fellows ? ''
19.6732	asked Paul , eagerly .
2246.9674	The more he read about it the greater became his desire to have a hand in organizing a Stanhope troop that might compete with those of Aldine and Manchester , two rival towns , both on the opposite side of the Bushkill River , the former a few miles up-stream , and the latter the same distance down .
46.1973	`` We do , and I tell you I like it better and better the more I hear of it , '' said Jack , earnestly .
333.0538	`` Why , I just had an idea it meant being junior soldiers , and drilling so as to be ready to invade Canada , or repel the yellow peril when the little Japs swarmed across the Pacific .
14.6545	Count me in , Paul . ''
12.1933	`` If I can pass the examination I 'm going with you , sure , '' observed William .
139.0310	`` All right , but if they take you in just remember that you 've got to quit your playing tricks on everybody , William , '' declared the other Carberry Twin .
6.8784	`` Listen to him , will you ?
61.6805	He 's feeling hard on me just because dad gave him a touch of the cane last night , thinking it was me .
23.3786	As if I was to blame for looking like my brother , '' the other said , plaintively , though chuckling at the same time .
2.7316	`` You know you fixed it so he 'd pounce on me .
2.8848	I 'm always in hot water because you must have your fun .
1.5937	` Taint fair , and I 'd have to be an angel not to kick .
9.9755	Oh !
303.2367	I hope you get to be a scout , because then I 'll have some peace , '' declared Wallace ; but all the others knew very well what a deep and abiding affection there really lay between the Carberry Twins .
17.8296	`` Let 's go home now .
71.8394	No use staying any longer out here , with Ted Slavin and his cronies hanging around , ready to bombard us again .
37.2405	Besides , I guess Paul wants to wait till he gets his book before telling us any more about the game . ''
7.2357	`` Right you are , Nuthin ' .
4.7060	I only wanted to see how the land lay , and if you took to the idea .
86.1402	I 'm satisfied already that it 's going to make a hit , if we can get a few more fellows to join in with us , '' said Paul .
40.6274	`` I know one good recruit I can drum up -- Tom Bates , '' spoke up Albert .
14.0440	`` And a good addition to the seven now here .
2.8172	That would make our first patrol , '' echoed the leader , quickly .
3.5171	`` How about inviting some of the Slavin crowd to join us ? ''
11.9483	asked Bobolink .
156.3439	`` Well , perhaps we might pick a couple there ; but I think you 'll have to be getting up early in the morning to manage it , '' replied Paul , meaningly .
10.0560	`` What 's that ? ''
20.4206	asked William .
9.4382	`` Just this .
23.1616	Ted Slavin has heard our plans .
0.2542	You know that he never likes to see anybody else pull down the plums .
9.1811	What will he do right away , fellows ? ''
43.3780	`` Go and see his shadow , Ward Kenwood , and get him to put up the money to start the ball rolling .
237.9556	My word for it that inside of a week there 'll be two rival Boy Scout troops in little old Stanhope , '' remarked Jack Stormways .
27.7892	`` Say , that would be great , if the other crowd only acted on the square , '' ventured William .
4.5838	`` We could have all sorts of contests between us .
44.9332	But I know Ted Slavin too well to believe he 'll ever subscribe to the twelve rules Wallace mentioned .
1.5440	Why , he 'd have to be made all over again to do that . ''
124.5718	`` Look here , Paul , if a fellow has to live up to the rules , however could the members of Ted 's company be taken into a troop of Boy Scouts ? ''
9.1287	asked Bobolink , who always sought information .
6.6679	`` I do n't believe they ever could .
20.1988	Still , there 's no law in the land to prevent any lot of boys from forming a patrol , and calling themselves scouts .
3.2272	That 's my way of looking at it , '' was the answer the leader gave .
211.4514	The lads were now on their way home , the lantern having been secured , and extinguished , lest it invite another bombardment on the part of their tormentors , doubtless still hovering somewhere nearby .
104.2944	No further attack came , however , for which some of them were possibly sorry , particularly William and Bluff , who delighted in strenuous action at all times .
482.6966	On the border of the town the seven separated into three groups , the twins going off arm in arm , Bluff , Bobolink and A. Cypher forming another ; while Paul and his particular chum made up the third .
226.1334	`` Well , '' said Paul , as they headed for the house of his comrade , which chanced to come before his own , `` what do you think of my scheme , Jack ? ''
10.4024	`` Immense , that 's what .
1.9137	I 'm only astonished that nobody else took up with the idea before .
4.7581	Poor old Stanhope seems to be away behind the times , Paul . ''
6.3776	`` Well , I do n't know .
60.6511	We 've had lots going on this summer to take up our time ; and then most of us were away during part of the vacation .
19.8171	There are other towns just as slow to catch on , '' returned the other , loyal to the place of his birth .
15.8781	`` But now that the ball has been started rolling , just watch how fast it gathers force .
6.7935	I know how you go at these things .
51.7109	And of all the fellows I ever met , you are the one best fitted to lead in this thing , if I understand the game right .
20.6258	Why , it 's just going to fit in with the things you 've preached and practiced for years . ''
25.4969	`` That 's why it appealed so strongly to me , after I really understood what the many duties of a scout were supposed to be .
8.8706	But what 's the matter with you , Jack ? ''
11.4184	`` Eh ?
9.9075	With me ?
14.7779	Oh , nothing much , Paul . ''
786.0844	But the other knew better , for he had noticed a frown come over Jack 's usually smiling countenance more than once that evening , when the other thought he was not observed ; and from this Paul felt positive his chum was worrying about something .
172.7592	`` Of course , if you think it best not to take me in on it , I 'm the last one to bother you , old chap , '' he went on , when Jack interrupted him .
5.0943	`` It was n't that , Paul , not in the least .
63.0224	To tell the truth I 've been thinking it over , and just about made up my mind that I must tell some one , or I 'd never sleep easy .
4.2021	And of all my friends you 're the one closest to me .
11.3733	Yes , I 'm going to confess that there is something that puzzles me , and fills me with alarm . ''
6.2905	`` Say , is it as bad as that , Jack ?
0.2780	But how is it you do n't want to go to your own folks ?
44.3884	You 've got one of the best dads I ever knew , and your mother , well , few are in the same class with her . ''
12.2310	`` That 's just it , Paul .
0.2057	I 'd hate to have either of them know anything about this trouble . ''
52.6652	Paul swung his friend around so that he could see into his face ; for they were just passing a street lamp at the time .
9.2169	`` Oh !
4.8493	I can look you in the eyes , old fellow .
1.6413	It is n't anything disgraceful I 've been doing , not at all .
149.0965	But you see , '' and again that frown darkened Jack 's brow as unpleasant things presented themselves before his mind 's eye , `` it 's a family affair , I 'm afraid , and must be kept quiet . ''
3.6804	`` Now you _ have _ got me to guessing good and hard .
5.5871	Suppose you tell me what it 's all about .
123.0419	I hope your brother , Karl -- '' and there Paul stopped , for by instinct he seemed to feel that he had guessed the truth the first shot .
0.4632	Jack had given a huge sigh that seemed to well up from his heart .
136.3411	`` Yes , it 's about Karl , only I do hope that it will prove a false alarm , because I just ca n't believe he 'd do such a rotten thing , '' the other went on , slowly .
2.4661	`` But he 's only a little fellow after all , Jack ? ''
3.7922	`` That 's so , but old enough to know better .
196.0774	You shall hear it all , and then perhaps you 'll advise me what to do , '' went on Paul 's chum , with a vein of relief in his voice , as though he felt better already , after deciding to share his trouble with another .
5.0242	`` That 's right , and you know that it goes no further , Jack . ''
117.1433	`` Karl got into some mischief a week ago , and to punish him father cut off his allowance of spending money for a whole month .
257.8673	Now , Karl belongs to a boys ' club , and I heard that at their last meeting the other day he paid up his dues , and seemed to have plenty of money .
0.1980	The question that is bothering me is , where did he get it ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.2005	is that all ?
49.3313	Why , you forget that your brother is a bright chap ; and I imagine you 'll find he 's been earning it some way or other ; or perhaps his mother gave it to him .
2.7114	But see here , there 's more back of this than you 've told me ? ''
19.3907	declared Paul , suddenly .
6.5557	`` There is , '' replied his chum .
42.0933	`` Listen now , and for goodness sake I hope you can cheer me up some , by explaining a mystery that 's bothering me .
0.9879	It 's about those old coins Uncle Reuben sent to me two years ago .
12.7499	There are some twenty-one in the lot .
0.2078	They 're copper coins , you know and I do n't suppose worth much .
55.5873	I 've always kept them in a little open cedar box on my table up in the den ; you 've spoken about them more than once . ''
95.1573	`` Sure , I remember all about them ; but you do n't mean to say -- '' and there Paul stopped , almost afraid to voice the thought that flashed before his mind .
0.1935	`` Yes , a bunch of them have gone in a mighty queer way .
467.2739	Why this morning there were just fourteen left ; but to tell the truth I was afraid to go up there at supper time when I came in after our last game of ball on the lot , to see if any more had disappeared . ''
15.4625	`` Say it plainly , Jack .
105.4164	Some one is taking your old coins , sent by your uncle , and you 're just afraid it 's Karl , tempted to get some money in that way .
4.6927	But where could he sell them , do you think ? ''
8.8973	`` There 's old Doc .
14.1603	Thomes , who keeps stamps and curios for sale .
5.7263	I 've seen some coins in his window often .
4.4562	He would know the value of these , and perhaps be willing to pay something for them .
9.9755	Oh !
6.7191	it 's just awful even to suspect my brother of being guilty of such a mean thing .
20.7660	I hate myself for allowing it , and have made up my mind just to hide the rest away , and never say a word . ''
7.4440	`` No , I would n't do that , Paul .
7.5274	In the first place it is n't fair to Karl . ''
11.1206	`` Fair ?
9.5816	What can you mean ?
2.4615	I would n't ever say a word to him , never ! ''
65.7940	`` That 's just it , but you would _ think _ it always ; and if he is innocent , why you see what a shame that would be .
7.7572	No , you ought to learn the truth , even though determined to keep your mouth shut afterward .
8.5580	In justice to Karl , you _ must _ know ! ''
6.0943	`` I believe you are right , old fellow .
3.4373	And I 'm going to be guided by what you say .
5.7190	Come in with me , wo n't you ? ''
21.0600	pleaded Jack .
12.0453	`` Yes , '' answered Paul , promptly .
9.9760	`` On condition that you take me up to your den , where we can talk without being disturbed . ''
5.9397	`` You have an object in saying that .
4.7860	I believe you want to see for yourself if any more of my coins have disappeared ? ''
9.8196	declared the other .
12.4707	`` I acknowledge the corn , for that is just what I wanted to learn , Jack . ''
239.1861	`` I suppose the sooner I take the bull by the horns , the quicker we can learn the truth ; so come on in , '' and taking his chum by the arm Jack led the way boldly up to the door of the Stormways ' house .
63.7010	They managed to pass upstairs to the third floor without attracting any attention , the family being gathered around a table in the living room , reading .
55.8364	No sooner had the lamp been lighted , after the door was closed , than Paul stepped over to the table desk which he knew so well .
44.5125	Just as Jack had said , there was a little cedar box standing in plain view , and the coins it held attracted his eye .
25.8829	Slowly and deliberately he proceeded to count them , while his chum awaited the result with abated breath , and his eyes turned in another direction .
8.4583	`` Well ? ''
67.1320	said Jack , hoarsely , when he saw that the other had dropped all of the coins back , one by one .
15.3840	`` You said there were fourteen left this morning , did n't you , Jack ? ''
13.1348	`` Yes , and now ? ''
6.3594	`` I find just eight here , that 's all ! ''
18.0153	came the answer that caused the wretched brother of young Karl Stormways to shiver and sigh dismally .
27.0706	`` Just thirteen gone now , '' said Jack , as he bent over to look for himself .
0.1665	`` Of course you know what they were , those that are missing ? ''
20.2505	suggested Paul .
17.8093	`` I have a list of the bunch somewhere ; made it out one day just for fun .
22.1524	Yes , I think I could tell them again ; but I never would have the heart to accuse old Doc .
6.4983	Thomes of buying stolen coins ; and the thief -- never ! ''
4.7027	`` I did n't mean that , Jack ; you mistook me .
85.1259	Suppose I had that list , and rooting over all the little boxes he keeps his coins in for sale , found every one of the missing ones there ? ''
5.8810	`` Yes , and then what ? ''
164.8815	asked the other , greatly affected , though watching his chum 's face eagerly , as though something seemed to tell him Paul would find a way out of the difficulty , such was his faith in the other .
16.3412	`` Why , perhaps you might buy the whole lot back , for almost a song , and never say a word . ''
68.5979	A hand crept out and squeezed Paul 's warmly ; and there were tears in the eyes of Jack Stormways as he made answer .
0.1970	`` Just like you , old fellow , to cheer me up like that .
5.4823	Here , let me hunt up the list for you .
0.5437	But promise that you wo n't whisper one little hint to a living soul .
9.9755	Oh !
16.2601	Karl , how could you ? ''
3.6519	`` Hold on , do n't judge him before you know .
7.9751	Believe him innocent until you find proof otherwise .
347.7957	I guess you 'll learn that one of the first things a scout has to do is to believe in his brothers and friends through thick and thin , until the proof has become positive , or the guilty one confesses .
62.2767	And another thing , Jack , in case the worst comes true , it 's up to us to make sure that such a miserable thing never happens again .
0.4163	We must save the one in error , save him through kindness and sympathy .
20.5059	How old is Karl ? ''
15.6577	`` A little over ten . ''
55.2962	`` Too young to join the troop then , for all boys have to be twelve or over , according to the rules , I was told .
3.1077	But they have younger fellows in the bunch over at Aldine , I 'm sure .
12.3909	One I saw strutting around in a uniform looked like a kid of eight or nine .
3.2967	Never mind ; I believe it 'll all come out right yet .
6.5054	Perhaps some servant may have taken them ? ''
8.3204	said Paul , wishing to buoy up his chum 's spirits .
7.3161	`` We only have one , and she 's been with us ever since I was born .
49.7153	No use thinking Maggie would touch a single thing , '' declared Jack , quickly , with a shake of his head .
28.2082	Paul sauntered about the room for a few minutes .
66.3155	Apparently he was glancing at the numerous college pennants and other things that were upon the walls ; but in reality he found himself wrestling with the strange puzzle that was giving his chum so much concern .
4.2482	Presently he stood by the window , which was partly open .
19.3130	`` Who owns the Dempsey house now , Jack ? ''
7.7475	he asked , indicating the building next door .
9.2169	`` Oh !
5.2025	it is still for sale , '' replied the other .
138.0758	`` They do n't want to rent it again , you know , and ever since that last party moved out of town and left things looking so bad , Mr. Dempsey has kept it closed up . ''
11.3319	`` When he lived here , you and Scissors used to be something of chums , did n't you ? ''
19.0024	Paul went on .
1.2711	`` Well , yes , '' the other admitted , `` when we were smaller .
7.2356	But ever since Scissors started going with the Slavin crowd I 've cut him dead . ''
2.8724	`` I wish I lived as close to you as this , '' Paul observed .
4.4079	`` Why , we could nearly shake hands across the gap .
1.7342	I do n't suppose Scissors ever drops in to see you nowadays ? ''
236.8726	`` I should say not , '' laughed Jack ; `` why , we 've been at swords points now for a year and more , and never even speak as we pass each other . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
40.2635	well , of course then it would be silly to think of suspecting him , '' remarked Paul as he sat down again .
43.5253	But nevertheless , many times his eyes seemed to turn toward that partly opened window , and then in the direction of the low desk where the box of coins stood .
39.5128	`` Scissors '' Dempsey had come by his nickname because of a peculiar trick he had of keeping his knees stiff when walking .
173.3186	Long ago one boy had likened his long legs to a pair of scissors , and quick to take up a humorous name like this , his mates had called him nothing else in years .
11.1787	`` Well , it 's a mighty funny thing where that bunch of old copper coins has gone to ! ''
11.0464	remarked Jack , presently , unable , it seemed , to think of anything else just then .
63.5208	`` I believe this den of yours is hardly ever locked , '' remarked Paul , presently , `` and all persons can come up here whenever they choose .
5.8608	I 've even often found your dog Carlo sleeping here .
63.1891	Why , if any friend calls to see you , and wants to wait till you come home , he just meanders up here as he pleases , and amuses himself looking over your books and magazines .
14.6787	Is n't that so , Jack ? ''
11.4864	`` Sure .
7.4059	My mother says this is Liberty Hall , judging from the way all my chums go and come .
16.2814	But what 's got you now ?
113.1446	Do you think some other chap may have fallen into the nasty habit of helping himself to my coins , either to swell out his own collection , or to sell them to Doc .
19.2776	Thomes ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.3667	hardly that , although it seems possible .
9.9216	But do n't worry too much about it , Jack .
3.2527	I 'm sure we 'll discover the truth sooner or later . ''
48.8130	`` Anyhow I 'll have eight to hide away ; part of a loaf is better than no bread , '' remarked the other , dejectedly .
9.2169	`` Oh !
3.2855	I would n't put them away , not just yet , anyhow , Jack . ''
23.4635	`` But , my goodness , perhaps I 'll lose all of my coins if I leave them around like this any longer on my desk ! ''
22.2677	`` That 's so , but do n't you see if you hide them , it shuts us off from ever learning who is taking them . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.7858	I see .
9.7855	You mean to catch him at it some time ; is that the idea , Paul ? ''
10.8760	`` Nothing less .
18.7470	I 'll drop in at the old dealer in curios to-morrow , and find out if he has any that are on this list .
5.7327	Listen , there 's somebody at the door ! ''
9.2484	`` It 's only Carlo , scratching to get in .
12.9612	Open the door , please , Paul . ''
238.0634	As the other did so a large Newfoundland dog stalked solemnly in , paid little heed to either of the occupants of the den , but snuggled down in a corner , where there was an old cushion , evidently placed there for his especial use .
9.2169	`` My !
101.0763	he 's getting fatter than ever , '' remarked Paul , surveying the bulging sides of the shaggy canine , as he curled himself up as if to sleep .
6.0936	`` I believe he is , the scamp .
4.4390	I see it when I put him through his paces with all the tricks I taught him .
22.5433	He 's getting too logy , and has to be told three times before he 'll do a blessed thing .
22.3057	But about this wretched matter , Paul -- you wo n't say anything to your folks , will you ? ''
8.2815	`` Not for the world .
1.5359	It 's your secret , and I 'd never leak a word without your permission .
15.6957	But I must be off now .
16.7511	Leave things just as you always have done ; and do n't shut or lock the door here any more than before .
3.8488	I 've got to do some studying over this Boy Scout affair when I get back .
8.1669	Whitson loaned me some pamphlets , but I did n't have time to read them through . ''
13.3026	Jack accompanied his friend down to the front door .
64.5299	Here Karl , having heard them descending the stairs , joined them ; and so far as Paul could see there was no change in the boy 's manner .
36.7012	If he had done wrong he must be clever enough to hide the guilt that lay in his heart , and put on a bold face .
9.4646	`` Remember ! ''
33.3844	was all Paul said as he squeezed Jack 's quivering hand , before jumping down the steps , boy fashion .
313.4618	It was enough to encourage the sorely distressed lad , for he had the greatest faith in Paul Morrison , the doctor 's son , that any boy could ever place in a comrade ; nor had the other ever failed to equal his expectations .
602.1473	`` I really believe Paul will do it , '' he was muttering to himself as he slowly went upstairs again to the den , with its decorations of college flags , and pictures of camping , canoeing , outdoor sports such as baseball and football struggles , and kindred things so dear to the heart of almost every growing lad ; `` yes , I believe he will if anybody can .
1.6391	But I wish he had let me hide the rest of them away .
3.2643	It seems like putting temptation in the way of a weak brother .
31.4594	But he told me I was n't even to believe Karl took the coins , and _ I wo n't _ ! ''
328.2876	Nevertheless , Jack Stormways must have passed a miserable night ; for the anxious eyes of his mother noticed his distressed looks when he came down to breakfast on the following morning .
422.9690	`` You do n't look well , son , '' she observed , as she passed her cool hand across his fevered brow ; `` I think you ought to step in and see Doctor Morrison some time this morning , and let him give you something . ''
40.0089	`` All right , mother ; but it 's only a little headache , '' he protested , for like all boys he disliked the thought of being considered sick .
78.1328	Her eyes turned solicitously toward him many times during the meal , for she saw that Jack was unusually dull , and took little part in the conversation .
180.5614	But it seemed that Karl made up for his brother 's lack of energy , for he was more than ordinarily inclined to be merry , and told numerous jokes he had heard from his fellows in the boys ' club he had joined .
377.5934	Jack mentioned that they were about to organize a Boy Scout patrol ; and very naturally his mother looked a bit serious at this news , until he explained some of the really excellent points connected with such an association ; when her face cleared at once .
9.2952	`` If that is what the movement means then the sooner a patrol is organized in Stanhope the better .
22.7601	There are a lot of boys who would be vastly benefitted by such uplifting resolutions , '' she declared , with some show of enthusiasm .
6.4569	`` Yes , mother , you are right , '' said Mr. Stormways , just then .
30.8329	`` Things have been going from bad to worse in our town of late , and the fathers are beginning to wonder where it will end .
42.1691	Only yesterday I met old Peleg Growdy .
23.8358	You remember the old fellow , for we stopped at his place when we were out riding , and had a drink at his well . ''
3.4818	`` Yes , and a most singular old man he was .
48.3746	I really could n't say that I was much impressed with his looks or conversation , '' replied the lady , as she poured another cup of coffee for her husband .
167.1786	`` All very true ; but he minds his own business if let alone ; and after all I find that he is a well educated man , up in most questions of the day .
43.7291	But the boys , or some of them at least , have for a long time considered old Peleg a fit subject for practical jokes .
8.9300	They change the lines on his team , given half a chance , and annoy him in every way possible .
2.7685	Really , I do n't wonder he is bitter about it . ''
5.5109	`` But you had something in mind , father , when you said that you met him ? ''
26.8318	Mr. Stormways looked at Jack .
350.0331	`` That is true , my son ; and do you know , the first thought that came to me was one of pleasure to feel absolutely sure no boy of mine would disgrace himself in plaguing an old man who had never harmed him . ''
525.2772	Jack felt a glow in the region of his heart at this show of confidence ; and resolved that more than ever would he merit it ; but somehow he could not help looking out of the tail of his eye toward Karl , to find that the color had mounted to his forehead , and that he seemed embarrassed .
148.4255	Was he thinking just then of the coins ; or did he have some knowledge of the practical joke that had been played on old Peleg Growdy ?
16.4196	`` Now , tell us what it was , Alan , '' said Mrs. Stormways , encouragingly .
42.8775	`` Well , perhaps in one way it may have been looked upon as something humorous , but it annoyed the old man very much .
35.5663	Last Sunday he went out to let his pigs run loose in the lot , as is his habit .
82.7328	When he pulled the rope that opened the little door in the back of the pen , he was astonished to see the queerest lot of porkers dash away that human eyes had ever beheld . ''
19.5662	Karl was snickering by now , showing that he must have some knowledge of what was to come .
17.1670	`` No two pigs looked alike .
167.3785	The boys had crept into the pen in the night , with a lantern , and some pots of paint taken from Mr. Rabow 's shop , and painted the whole drove in every color imaginable .
13.5384	One , he said , looked like the American flag .
29.6265	Another had four legs of different hues ; a third was striped yellow and green , and so it went .
67.6606	Imagine the old man 's amazement as he saw them kicking up their legs , and tearing around like mad ; for the sun had reached the turpentine in the paint , and made it burn tremendously . ''
44.5700	Karl gave a shout , and even Mrs. Stormways could not repress a smile , though she felt that it was wrong .
297.6406	`` I heard about it from one of the boys , father ; I do n't want to tell his name , you see , because it might get him into a scrape , '' said Karl , as he managed to get his breath again .
366.0917	Jack breathed easier , since he knew now that his brother had not been concerned in the adventure ; still , there was that other thing -- but he had promised Paul not to believe , or even suspect , anything so early in the game .
150.8571	`` I admit that it does seem ludicrous ; and no doubt if I had been there I must have been strongly tempted to laugh at the comical spectacle those six pigs must have presented .
2.7705	But it is the spirit of the thing that looks so bad .
107.9283	Growdy never harmed a boy in his life , he says , and only wants to be let alone ; but they went out of their way to play a malicious trick on the old man .
48.4677	It took him the whole of Sunday to scrape that paint off the hides of his pigs ; which I consider a pretty hard proposition .
39.9080	And I repeat what I said before , that I 'm pleased to know a son of mine would not be guilty of so mean a trick . ''
181.0695	Karl left the table just then , and his brother fancied that he looked a bit confused , as though his conscience were troubling him , but then Jack hoped he might be mistaken .
154.1982	Paul had said that he would be away the greater part of the day , his father having asked him to go to the city on an important errand .
22.5453	Consequently there was no opportunity for the two chums to confer upon any of the matters that were interesting then .
184.6624	But all the boys had agreed to meet at the house of Nuthin ' that evening , to plunge deeper into the subject of organizing at least one scout patrol in Stanhope .
86.1821	As usual Paul called for Jack , and as the latter 's parents knew what was on tap , there was no opposition shown to his going out .
8.9331	`` Has anything happened to-day ? ''
2.9928	whispered the visitor , as he was joined by Jack in the hall .
197.0288	`` Yes , I was out a lot with the fellows , and doing some chores around ; but I mustered up enough courage just before supper to go upstairs , '' replied the other , his voice giving plain warning as to what was to follow , for it showed the strain .
8.7099	`` And counted the coins again , perhaps to find them short , eh , Jack ? ''
9.0077	`` Well , you said there were eight , and now I can count only six .
1.6963	Why , it 's getting to be a regular clock-like piece of business .
12.7717	And after what father said this morning , too . ''
7.6365	`` What did he say ? ''
20.4206	asked Paul .
10.4164	`` Come along .
116.8569	I 'll tell you while we 're on our way , '' and Jack gave a nervous look over his shoulder , as though afraid lest his brother pop out on them unawares .
130.8106	As they walked slowly along the road he spoke in the affectionate manner in which Mr. Stormways had declared his utmost faith in the honesty and integrity of his two boys .
6.7030	`` But you 're not sure that Karl has anything to do with the disappearing coins .
6.8836	Other boys may have been up there to-day ? ''
9.1666	suggested his friend , quickly .
17.7239	`` I asked mother , and she said she did n't remember that any one had come to see me .
2.6333	No , the more I think about it the worse I feel .
1.6229	But I guess you did n't have any time to see old Doc .
6.7757	Thomes before you went to the city , did you ? ''
169.3525	`` That 's just what I did , dropped into his shop , told him I was going down to New York on business for dad , and asked if I could do anything for him . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
18.2048	how bright of you , Paul .
7.0247	And what did he say to that ? ''
6.7698	`` It seemed to quite tickle the old chap .
115.2662	He said he had a little package he wanted to send in to a dealer on Fourteenth Street , and would be glad if I took it to him , instead of his sending it by express . ''
2.4126	`` A package , Paul ; did he say what it contained ? ''
4.6391	demanded the other , almost holding his breath with sudden alarm .
1.4926	`` Yes , a lot of old coins he had been buying lately .
13.1603	Now , hold your horses , Jack , my boy .
0.1772	He had n't made it up yet , and I helped him do it .
8.5499	There was n't one of the same kind yours are .
7.2873	He bought the collection of Chinese and Japanese coins old Captain Crocker owned .
1.2934	His widow had no use for them , and needed the money . ''
391.2653	`` Oh , you gave me a scare , Paul ; but I 'm glad you saw them , for I 'd always imagine mine must have been in the lot ; not that I care a bit for the old things now ; but it was the thought , you know , the terrible suspicion . ''
1.5814	`` Yes , and while about it I managed to see every old coin Doc .
0.1931	has in his shop , for he was pleased to let me root around .
22.3662	And Jack , not a single one of your missing pieces has he got , depend on it . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
21.2826	well , '' remarked Jack , arousing himself , `` let 's try and forget my troubles for a while .
54.7433	Unless I get it off my mind I 'll lie awake again , and then your father , the doctor , will give me some medicine that tastes even worse than what he did to-day .
8.7159	Did you get that manual you sent for , Paul ? ''
15.7955	and the speaker resolutely shut his teeth hard together as if determined to keep his mind off the harassing subject .
5.4750	`` Yes , it 's in my pocket , and seems to be full of meat , too .
49.8264	I have n't had much chance to soak it in , but what I did read interested me a whole lot , '' returned the doctor 's son .
134.9720	`` Well , I thought of a friend I had over in Manchester , and this afternoon I took my wheel and jumped down there , crossing by the bridge .
38.1805	Just as I hoped , Landy is a member of the troop there , and he gladly told me all he knew about the business .
19.0946	I 'm more than ever tickled at the idea of our having a branch up here , to compete with the neighboring towns .
2.9166	He told me something more that we might consider , too . ''
16.3911	`` What was that , Jack ? ''
9.4993	`` You remember Mr. Silas Westervelt , the Quaker of Manchester ? ''
11.4864	`` Sure .
26.4265	I 've often talked with him , and my father is their family doctor , '' replied Paul , readily enough .
8.4364	`` It seems that he 's become interested in this scout movement , which he endorses through and through .
137.2763	The result is that he has offered a beautiful banner to the organization that can show the highest degree of efficiency , and the greatest number of merit marks by Thanksgiving day .
6.2812	It 's being made now , down in the city . ''
149.1280	`` That counts us in , then , for we 'll have plenty of time to get busy before the day of turkey rolls around , eh , Jack ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
12.8528	we 'll be in the contest all right , even if we are counted in the ` also ran ' class .
34.5458	These other fellows have been camping this summer , and must be up in many of the things that count .
110.1728	But then , they have n't got Paul Morrison at the head as scout leader , and that means everything in our favor , '' declared Jack , warmly .
7.0163	`` Please cut that out after this .
114.6402	It 's true that I 've always been deeply interested in many things connected with life in the woods ; but you see that 's only one part of a good scout 's credit marks .
19.7813	In fact , there 's hardly one thing in all the trades and professions that is omitted from the list .
6.0023	Only he must _ excel _ in all he undertakes .
20.9047	And soon we will have to find a young man over twenty-one who will act as our scout master . ''
264.4931	`` Hold up , there 's Bobolink hurrying to catch us ; and he acts as if he might be the bearer of important news , '' remarked Jack , who had heard a hail from the rear , and turned his head to see a flitting form .
7.9515	The other came up , panting heavily .
13.8959	`` Say , you fellows must have the seven league boots , the way you get over ground .
18.6435	And just after I 've gone and made away with a monstrous supper , too , '' he managed to say , between gasps .
2.8184	`` Let me get my breath , and I 've got something to tell you . ''
14.2510	`` Is it about Ted Slavin and his cronies ? ''
19.8295	asked Paul , suspiciously .
6.2329	`` Hit it the first shot , '' returned Bobolink ; `` who told you ? ''
180.5048	`` Why , I have n't heard a word ; only I thought that if there was anything going on , Ted would be apt to have a finger in the pie , '' returned the other , grimly .
3.3325	`` Well , he has , all right , as usual .
5.6975	Anyhow his mouthpiece , Ward Kenwood , has , and it 's the same thing .
112.4535	I was taking something in to the dominie at our church -LRB- my mother is at the head of a committee , you know -RRB- when he asked me if I was going to join the new Boy Scout patrol that was being organized in Stanhope . ''
13.1703	`` Whew , but those fellows do n't believe in letting the grass grow under their feet , do they ?
195.1392	Never thought a thing about it till they heard us talking matters over ; and here they 're getting all the credit for being first in the field , '' and Jack shrugged his shoulders ruefully as he spoke .
40.3605	`` Did n't I say we 'd have to get up early in the morning if we hoped to keep from taking their dust ?
86.1534	No matter what else you can say about them , Ted and his crowd are alive , and wide-awake fellows all the time , '' returned Paul .
1.4572	`` Well , the minister was some surprised when I told him all about it .
1.4335	He said he was delighted , and I guess he meant it too .
6.0059	The more patrols the better for the community , he said .
32.6236	And he seemed to know all about the meaning of the thing , for he showed me several books along the subject , that he promised to lend us . ''
8.7554	`` Bully for him ! ''
332.8537	cried Jack , with perhaps more energy than reverence ; but had the genial old man heard the words he would have felt highly complimented , knowing that whoever succeeds in getting the approval of live , wide-awake boys must consider himself fortunate indeed .
1.7942	`` There 's Nuthin 's house , '' remarked Bobolink , just then .
14.3716	`` And Tom Bates going in , with the Carberry Twins .
6.1511	I hope we can enroll a dozen good fellows for a start .
68.1915	The rest will flock over after a bit , when they get to know what fine times we expect to have , '' remarked Paul .
114.5756	They found that there were just a dozen present , counting A. Cypher , who as host was much in evidence .
1475.9307	Besides Tom Bates , the new boys were Philip Towns , Jud Elderkin , Joe Clausin and Andy Flinn ; the latter of Irish parentage , but well liked , even though his widowed mother had to take in washing to provide food for the numerous mouths dependent on her .
185.1411	Andy was a particularly bright boy , and many declared that he had a future before him , if only he kept away from the one curse of his father 's life , rum .
136.8656	But as he hated the very word drink , there seemed to be little danger that he would be apt to follow in the footsteps of the brilliant man who had fallen so early in life , and left a family nearly destitute .
38.1765	`` Meeting please come to order , '' called Paul , after he had been pushed into a chair to serve as temporary chairman .
74.4336	Soon the boys began to go into the details of the projected troop , its meaning , what good it might be expected to accomplish , and everything connected with the Boy Scout organization .
287.8023	Paul read page after page from the book he had brought , while the others , including the parents of A. Cypher , listened , and applauded at times , as some particularly fine point happened to strike them .
223.2314	`` That ought to do for the present , '' said Paul , finally , as he closed the book and beamed upon his mates ; `` and now , what do you think , fellows ? ''
28.9138	`` I 'm just wild to get started , and more so than ever after hearing all about the hundreds of fine things scouts can do .
17.7046	I 'm a crank on making fires , and I guess I 'd qualify right easy for the championship in that tournament ! ''
52.9331	exclaimed William Carberry , his face aglow .
16.4533	`` Yes , and I remember the time he nearly burned our house down , trying to start a blaze without a match .
30.4046	He got the fire all right ; but there was a lively time around there , until the bucket brigade arrived , and slushed things down .
9.9755	Oh !
85.9665	you can believe William ; he 's some on the fire racket , '' remarked the other Twin , at which there was a roar from those present .
27.1900	`` I move that we write out just what we intend to do , and that all the fellows in the room sign it as charter members .
12.9401	Then we 'll try to double our dozen by a week , and rush things along .
10.1397	We already have enough for the first patrol and half a second .
18.6829	If we expect to compete with those other troops in the struggle for supremacy we 've got to be awake and doing . ''
13.6471	`` You never said truer words , Paul .
1.8723	What sort of a binding agreement had we ought to get up ? ''
433.2240	asked Bobolink , pretending that it was Tom Bates who spoke ; for really the boy had a wonderful gift of ventriloquism , and often amused himself , and his friends as well , by sending his voice into strange places , to the wonder of those who were not aware of his tricks .
3.0174	`` I thought that over , and wrote out what I believed would cover the ground .
6.4141	If you listen now , I 'll read it to you , '' returned the chairman .
10.2032	`` Hear !
10.2032	hear ye !
14.9875	All keep silent while our honored chairman reads the document to which we expect to subscribe our names and seals ! ''
19.7927	called William , pompously .
159.9372	What Paul had written was simply that those whose names were found below had united themselves together with the idea of forming a troop that could be connected with the regular Boys Scout organization as incorporated .
791.5157	Then every boy present wrote his name beneath the agreement , after which they went into executive session , the parents of A. Cypher being kindly but firmly requested to retire from the room , while the election of officers proceeded , and other necessary steps were taken to perfect the first patrol .
25.4682	So the first patrol of Stanhope Troop was organized , and consisted of the eight originators of the scheme .
13.4849	It was decided to call this the Red Fox patrol .
105.8832	As fast as others were arranged for they could take on such names as Gray Fox , White Fox and even Black Fox .
207.3389	Later on they hoped to secure a scout master , but just now with Paul and Wallace brimming over with woods ' lore , the lack of such an officer would not bother them .
790.8339	The meeting ended in Paul being placed in the honored position of scout leader , with the second position being thrust on Jack Stormways , though he declared that Wallace Carberry was far better qualified to fill it than he ever could be .
12.7575	But Paul was satisfied to have it so .
3.0171	Jack was his favorite chum ; and he would be thrown much in his company .
182.7459	Besides , the desire to study up the rules , and perfect himself in all that an assistant scout master should know , might for a time at least take Jack 's thoughts away from the subject of his trouble at home .
350.3322	Before the boys left they were summoned to the dining room , where refreshments were placed before them ; and when the meeting did finally break up every fellow felt deep down in his heart that an important step had been taken toward raising the standard of living among the rising generation of Stanhope .
64.8988	Finally , as the hour had grown fairly late it was suggested that they leave in a body , since all military organizations did this .
100.9961	`` And , '' continued the one who had put this idea forward , `` while we have nothing to do with the army itself , we expect to be governed by certain military rules .
8.7994	What say , fellows ? ''
18.1697	`` Fall in !
18.6484	fall in ! ''
397.8278	Out of the door they marched , and down the steps , two by two ; Bluff Shipley , who was paired with Nuthin ' , being the lone straggler in the rear , since his mate remained at home .
25.0682	If he experienced the slightest sense of dejection at being compelled to walk without a side partner , it was of very brief duration .
86.3857	Outside it was very dark , and this condition seemed more or less heightened by the fact that the eyes of the young scouts had become accustomed to the glow of the rooms they had just left .
29.7772	Consequently there was more or less chance of some one tripping on the steps , and pulling others down with him . ''
5.8280	` Ware the fourth step ; it 's shaky and may throw you , boys ! ''
10.1009	sang out Nuthin ' .
45.4727	Hardly had he spoken than the first pair executed a beautiful forward bow , and went down in a heap from the lower step .
10.3705	`` Look out there !
9.8278	A rope ! ''
97.6782	Paul had just barely time to give utterance to this warning when the next pair found the obstruction for themselves , and came plunging down on top of those already landed .
97.3850	Two more were close behind , so nearly upon the heels of the second pair that it was really impossible for them to avoid following in their wake .
126.1761	Thus there were by this time six struggling figures at the foot of the steps , while the balance of the patrol huddled just above , looking with amazement at the dimly seen spectacle .
24.3376	From somewhere near by , possibly the shelter of some bushes , came gurgles of boyish laughter , and jeering words in assumed voices .
10.8702	No need to tell Paul and his friends to whose kind attention they owed this unexpected downfall .
43.0006	Ted Slavin and his backers had not been idle while the new patrol was being organized in the home of Nuthin ' .
9.4053	They had fastened a stout rope across the lower step , and succeeded in tripping half of their rivals .
61.4316	Paul managed to scramble to his feet , hardly knowing whether to laugh , or get angry at this practical joke on the part of the opposition .
12.9743	`` It 's that Slavin crowd ! ''
13.4887	exclaimed Jack , as he gained his feet .
4.2879	`` Let 's capture some of them , then ! ''
97.3615	shouted William , always ready for battle , as was also Bluff Shipley , whose hands were never bothered with impediments as was his speech .
7.1508	A rush was made for the bushes , and retreating footsteps announced the hasty departure of the enemy .
3.5425	None of the new scouts seemed to care about following very far .
97.1057	They knew Ted of old , and feared lest they be drawn into a trap , so that their last condition would be really worse than the first .
146.5398	`` No damage done , after all , '' remarked Paul , as he brushed off his clothes ; while the others gathered around , and Nuthin ' came down to secure the treacherous rope .
35.6256	`` Barked my shins some , now ; and sooner or later I 've just got to take it out of that crowd ! ''
11.2137	muttered William , limping around , and shaking his head .
64.2343	`` Better do it soon , then , '' observed Bobolink , `` for after you 've taken the oath of allegiance to the scouts you dassent tackle a feller without losing marks . ''
9.5751	`` H 'm !
10.0918	is that so ? ''
82.8608	grunted the injured member , regretfully ; for to be deprived of the boon of fighting would be taking some of the joys of life away from the pugnacious Carberry twin .
15.7335	`` Fall in again , boys ! ''
19.8478	said Paul , cheerily .
3.6877	`` Not the same way , I hope , captain ! ''
1.9473	ventured Bobolink ; at which there was a laugh , and the incident seemed closed .
43.4083	The boys had no doubt but that their rivals must have been observing much that went on in the lighted rooms , possibly also trying to catch what was being said .
7.6300	`` What of it ? ''
76.2265	demanded Paul , when some one suggested this ; `` if they heard what I read out of that manual so much the better .
16.6218	Let them subscribe to those rules , and life will be worth living alongside Ted and his cronies . ''
5.1842	`` But you see they just ca n't ! ''
10.9748	declared Bobolink , quickly .
5.9945	`` Which is to say they wo n't .
10.3360	All right .
0.4356	Once we get out troop formed , public sentiment will be on our side .
135.3981	If they try to worry us the good people of Stanhope , backed by the Women 's Club , will see to it that the nuisance is stopped .
14.6787	Is n't that so , Paul ? ''
13.6420	remarked Jack , with conviction in his voice .
0.2403	`` Them 's my sentiments , as some character in fiction used to remark .
1.6291	We can afford to laugh at all these little plans to annoy us .
44.2927	Of course , if they go too far , why we may have to turn and do something ourselves , '' said Paul , seriously .
11.3416	`` Bully !
9.2356	Hasten the time ! ''
3.5457	cried William , ceasing to limp for the moment in his new delight .
9.2169	`` Oh !
7.8759	but Paul does n't mean a regular give and take fight .
289.7860	If we pitch in at all , I 'm afraid it 'll have to be doling out punishment in the way the good dad does when he plies the stick and says it hurts him worse than it does the bad kid , '' declared Bobolink ; at which there was a roar .
75.8919	On the following day there was more or less skirmishing about town by various eager lads , seeking recruits for the rival troops .
13.0661	Paul was as busy as a beaver , and at several points conferred with some of his followers .
174.2804	He had sent for more manuals , besides a price list of uniforms , and other equipments necessary to the complete organization of the Fox Patrol and Stanhope Troop No. 1 .
8.9261	Leading citizens began to take an interest in the movement , as they grew to understand its true significance .
6.4424	Stanhope seemed to be fairly sizzling with a new and novel energy .
384.6339	Even the meeting of the Women 's Club that afternoon was given up partly to a discussion of the merits of the Boy Scout wave then sweeping over the land ; and ladies who had been decidedly averse to such a thing found their eyes opened to its beneficial accompaniments .
5.9472	As was to be expected , the recruiting was not confined to Paul and his chums .
393.5526	Ted Slavin and Ward Kenwood were just as vigorously employed ; and several times in the course of the day the rivals ran across each other while engaged in thus drumming up new subjects for initiation .
15.1141	On such occasions there was apt to be something in the way of verbal fireworks passing between the opposing scouts .
89.2364	Ted Slavin seldom knew how to bridle that tongue of his ; and Ward Kenwood seemed to be in a nasty humor himself .
535.5518	To tell the truth there had long been a sort of rivalry between Paul and Ward over the smiles of pretty Arline Blair ; and latterly the high school girl seemed to be giving young Morrison more than his share of her company .
355.0249	That afternoon about four o'clock , as Paul and two of his chums were passing along one of the side streets of the town they came upon a scene that caused a sudden halt .
64.1481	The blustering voice of Ted Slavin was what first drew their attention ; and it seemed to come from around the next corner .
7.2619	Then followed a quavering voice , pleading in its tone .
9.8324	Paul looked at his friends , and his brow darkened .
27.0530	`` It 's old Mother Martha , the market woman who sells things in her little stall around here .
82.0205	And some of those mean skunks are plaguing her , like they often do , she tells me , stealing her apples , and laughing at her , because she 's lame with the rheumatism , and ca n't chase after 'em ! ''
14.1285	said William , who happened to be one of the trio brought to a halt so suddenly .
2.4332	`` Come on , then ; we ca n't stand that ! ''
21.2871	exclaimed Paul .
23.3132	The boys hurriedly turned the corner , to find that what William had suggested seemed to be the actual truth .
8.2081	Ted and a follower were hovering near the poor old woman .
752.3425	The fact that Ted was contentedly munching a red apple told that he had already made his hawk-like descent on the stand of the market woman , and was now seeking to distract her attention so that his companion might also swoop down to seize a prize , when they would go off , laughing uproarously , as though they considered it a huge joke .
107.3899	Paul was on the bully in a flash , and almost before Ted knew of his presence he had torn the apple from his grasp and hurled it far away .
5.4437	`` Get out of this , you coward ! ''
256.0057	exclaimed the scout leader of the new patrol , as he gave Ted Slavin a push ; `` I 'm going to speak to the chief of police about the way you rob this good woman , and see if he wo n't stop it .
2.7222	You ought to be ashamed of yourselves , both of you ! ''
123.6578	William and Bluff were for jumping at the two offenders , and giving them a lesson then and there ; but with both arms Paul held his fire-eaters back .
0.1821	`` Let 'em come on , if they want to mix up with us .
4.8918	We can take care of two , and think it a picnic .
60.7485	P'raps even three would n't be too much , if so be you want to try it on , Paul Morrison .
11.9849	Huh !
8.4433	there comes another bunch of your sissies .
25.1226	Seven against two might make it too interestin ' , so we 'd better skip out , Scissors .
5.8692	But you just wait , that 's all .
12.9373	I do n't forget you laid a hand on me ; and some time I 'm going to take it out . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
7.0250	suit yourself , Ted , '' answered the other , promptly .
14.2363	`` I 'm ready to have a go at you when you 're ready , if you force me to the wall .
34.7930	I 'm not a fighter , but when I see a couple of rowdies treating a poor old woman like you did , it makes me see red . ''
140.6217	With derisive jeers the pair faded away as several boys came running to the spot , having seen the group , and guessing from the presence of the two rival leaders that there must be something doing .
39.5102	Their indignation was boundless when they learned what new meanness the coming of Paul and his two chums had interrupted .
9.3046	It required considerable persuasion on the part of the scout leader to prevent an immediate chase of the culprits .
76.4954	`` Let them go this time , '' said Paul , impressively ; `` but I 'm going to see what can be done to put a stop to this rowdyism .
4.4010	It gives the boys of Stanhope a bad name all around .
3.0157	I told Ted I 'd speak to Chief Billings about it . ''
653.5278	`` You wo n't get any too much satisfaction there , '' remarked wise Nuthin ' ; `` because , you see the Chief owes his position to the political influence of Mr. Kenwood ; and as Ward runs with Ted he wo n't dare do anything for fear of offending the head of the party .
4.5141	We 've just _ got _ to find a way ourselves to change things . ''
4.3868	`` Well , I 'll ask my father about it .
8.4437	Perhaps he can suggest a plan .
378.1047	He used to be a boy himself once , and never forgets it either , '' was Paul 's conclusion , as they each bought an apple from the old woman to make her forget her recent trouble , and then walked away , followed by her earnest thanks .
159.4985	`` Say , but time just crawls along , '' observed William , dolefully ; `` because , you see , I 'm dying to get to work and win some of them merits you told us about .
91.0421	Just set me the stunt of making water boil over a fire I have to kindle , and I 'll do it in three shakes of a lamb 's tail .
8.2079	The rest of you will be left hull down .
1.4751	And then there 's lots of other jobs that look good to me .
2.9316	Let 's get a move on , and start the ball rolling .
14.1523	When 's the next meeting , Paul ? ''
4.5242	`` To-night , and once more at the barn where we were first .
16.0572	This time I figure on having nearly twenty present , and that will make things interesting . ''
23.2279	`` Same hour as before -- eight o'clock ? ''
11.9483	asked Bobolink .
9.2169	`` Yes .
307.3696	And if any of you feel that you are qualified to take the examination for the first degree , so as to become real tenderfeet in the Scouts , why , I 'll be in trim to put you through your sprouts , '' announced the leader .
74.7652	`` That hits me , '' declared William ; `` for I 've been studying to beat the band , and believe I 'll pass muster with flying colors .
11.9365	Me for the tenderfoot class ! ''
178.4716	`` And I 've just used up a whole ball of twine tying all those measly knots , '' declared Nuthin ' ; after which his face brightened when he added : `` but I can do every one just like an old jack tar .
28.4139	My dad was once a sailor you know , and that 's where I 've got the bulge on the rest of you .
4.7151	So-long , boys ; I 'm going home to try again . ''
7.8439	`` Who goes there ? ''
21.2921	`` A scout of the Red Fox Patrol ! ''
7.7655	`` Advance scout , and give the countersign ! ''
28.8268	A figure came shuffling forward , bent over , and whispered a word in the ear of the sentinel at the door of the old tobacco barn .
11.5054	`` Correct !
8.7174	Pass in , scout ! ''
15.3347	said the one on guard , solemnly .
59.3888	But William chose to loiter by the door , and watch the gathering of the clans , for the boys arrived rapidly after that , usually in pairs .
8.1317	`` Where 's the other twin ? ''
25.8389	asked Paul , seeing William alone .
10.3517	`` Unavoidably detained , Captain .
9.2492	May be on deck later .
590.3819	Here comes another bunch , '' and William stepped aside to allow the sentry to halt Andy Flinn , who had arrived in company with Jud Elderkin , the latter as tall and thin as the former was fat and pudgy .
171.8649	`` Pass along , gentlemen , '' sang out William , after the pair had successfully stood the test ; `` the animals went in two by two ; the elephant and the kangaroo ! ''
11.6943	and as usual there was a laugh at this sally , which applied so aptly to the couple just entering .
309.9000	`` All here now , Paul , '' announced Jack Stormways , counting noses in the light of half a dozen lanterns provided by Mr. Shipley , the owner of the barn .
24.1261	For an hour routine business was transacted .
50.4612	There were just twenty-one names on the roll now , and all present saving two , Wallace Carberry and another .
344.1408	It was decided to organize two patrols at once , the first to be under the charge of Paul as scout leader , while Jud Elderkin took the Gray Fox crowd .
15.1013	The more the assembled lads learned concerning the duties and sports of the Boy Scouts , the greater became their enthusiasm .
61.9560	As the evening progressed they were fairly bubbling over with excitement , and it began to look as though the success of the new movement were already assured .
250.4836	But Paul knew that it must be a constant fight between the natural rough-and-ready , give-and-take spirit which almost every boy inherits from his ancestors , and the new idea that would have him a hero without being a bully or a brawler .
123.4115	And he was not surprised when , later on , just before they thought of breaking up the meeting , William got the floor on the question of a personal privilege , and threw a bombshell into the camp .
66.1012	`` I 'm going to ask a favor of you fellows , '' he said ; `` and you can help me break even with that old rooster as well as have some fun .
7.6705	D'ye think you can stand the racket ? ''
39.1976	The others crowded around , for they knew very well that when William had anything to propose it usually meant some frolic .
77.3224	But Paul noticed to his surprise that the joker seemed worked up far more than he could ever remember seeing him before , and he scented trouble ahead .
11.7775	`` Who is it this time , William ?
7.7011	Tell us about it , old fellow !
1.7574	Of course we 're bound to stand by you through thick and thin .
3.7076	That 's one of the first duties of a scout , you know .
5.0231	Speak up , and give us a tip ! ''
163.5574	It was Jud Elderkin who said this ; but that he voiced the sentiments of pretty much the entire group could be judged from the chorus of exclamations that greeted his aggressive speech .
51.4899	`` It 's that old grumpy miser , Peleg Growdy , '' said the orator , waving his hands to emphasize his words .
16.6192	`` He never had any use for boys , you know , and often says he wonders why the pests were ever born .
28.3974	I do n't remember doing him any mean thing in my life , but he 's got it in for the whole creation of boys , I expect . ''
5.6771	`` What did he do to you ? ''
11.9781	`` Yes , tell us , William .
5.8556	We 'll stand by you , never fear . ''
5.1610	`` He needs a good lesson , the old skinflint .
8.4686	Tell us what happened ! ''
83.5565	William grinned , for he saw that he had already captured the hearts of his comrades , and had small need to fear they would let him seek satisfaction alone .
6.6183	Jack Stormways was as deeply interested in the outcome as his chum Paul .
52.3905	He remembered all his father had said at the breakfast table on the preceding day , in connection with this same man Growdy .
12.6144	William was proceeding to thrill his hearers some more .
72.2502	To hear him talk one might imagine his father was a celebrated lawyer instead of the town blacksmith , for William had a smooth tongue .
174.2732	`` I guess all of you know by this time what some fellers did to Growdy 's pigs last Saturday night , painting 'em to beat the band ?
12.8301	It 's the talk of the town , and lots of folks says that it serves the old crusty just right .
540.4325	But I was tucked away in my little bed alongside t ` other twin that night , as snug as two bugs in a rug ; and consequently had my little _ alibi _ ready to prove I was n't in the bunch that paid him that sly visit . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
4.4637	we all know who did it , never fear ! ''
29.2469	cried Joe Clausin .
10.4554	`` He spells his name T-e-d ! ''
12.2718	echoed Bobolink .
9.4853	`` All right .
52.2651	Because some bad boys played that joke on old Growdy he seems to have it in for every mother 's son in Stanhope .
28.4178	I met him on the road this afternoon when I was out with a light wagon after some feed .
0.2088	He was on the way to town to deliver a big load of truck .
3.6384	Everybody 's entitled to half the road ; ai n't that the law , fellers ? ''
16.3115	`` Sure it is , William ; but that mean man would n't budge for you , hey ? ''
19.8725	said Jud .
8.6661	`` Not for an inch .
3.5237	Just hauled up there taking two-thirds of the road , and started to light his pipe .
37.0033	I was in a hurry to get along , and thought I could just squeeze by ; but I made a mistake , and my wagon got upset in the ditch .
11.7355	He went on , grinning at my trouble , and never offering to raise a hand to help me out . ''
8.6552	Exclamations of indignation arose on all sides .
6.2910	`` He needs another lesson , boys ! ''
3.9781	`` Say the word , William , and we 're with you .
7.2615	Guess I might think up a few ways for you to get even with the old skinflint ! ''
0.4608	Paul saw that they were rapidly being swayed by their feelings of natural resentment .
142.6946	He had no particular reason for liking Peleg Growdy any more than the balance of the group ; but the lesson of returning good for evil had taken full possession of his soul .
109.5721	Once he would have been only too ready to join in with his chums in redressing what seemed to be a positive wrong ; but somehow it was different now .
45.3047	Before he could speak , however , Jack had elbowed his way into the midst of the excited lads , his face full of determination .
4.4974	`` Wait a bit , you fellows , before you decide what you 're going to do .
2.6915	I want to tell you something that ought to interest you . ''
12.1101	`` All right , Jack ; speak up .
55.1102	Any objection to joining in with us and having a little fun while we help a brother even up his score ? ''
10.4230	demanded a voice .
65.0838	Then Jack repeated as well as he was able the conversation that had taken place at the breakfast table in his house .
20.9031	He went even further than this , for it happened that he knew something about the old man 's past .
103.2634	`` Peleg Growdy is a crabbed old chap , I admit ; but perhaps you would n't blame him so much if you knew the trouble he has had . ''
10.0560	`` What was that ? ''
20.5921	asked one boy .
25.7653	`` His wife and two children were burned to death when his house caught fire many years ago .
5.8997	Another child grew up to be a man , and committed some crime that made him run away .
2.7984	His last one , a daughter , was killed in a railroad wreck .
18.5780	Ever since then the old man shuns people , and just works as if he never wanted to know a living soul . ''
5.1048	`` That 's tough , for a fact ! ''
19.0982	admitted one boy , slowly .
3.8449	`` But it do n't excuse him for hating all boys .
92.0246	What business did he have sitting there and taking two-thirds of the road , to let William upset in the ditch trying to pass him ? ''
19.4714	demanded Jud , still rebelling .
9.2169	`` Oh !
1.5280	well , that 's a rule of the road that is n't always carried out .
175.3266	For instance , the loaded vehicle is generally given _ more _ than its half ; and William admits he was going light , while the old man carried a heavy load , '' said Jack .
12.5856	`` Yes , that 's so , '' grunted William , unable to hold out against such logic .
97.5225	`` And perhaps , if he told the actual truth , William would admit that there was room enough for him to pass , if he had been a little more careful ! ''
19.4953	`` Sure ; but I was in a hurry , you understand ; and did n't see that the edge of the ditch was crumbly .
1.3141	But he laughed , I tell you , and that riled me ! ''
179.5014	`` And now you want to bring a dozen and more of your friends down on his place to commit some prank that will make him dislike boys more than ever .
209.1872	It 's all wrong , I tell you , fellows , and for one I refuse to lend a hand , '' and Jack folded his arms as though his mind were made up once and for all .
47.2989	Paul saw that they were very near a division that might be fatal to the future good of the cause .
8.8616	He wondered whether he could swing the crowd to the other side , like the pendulum of a clock .
62.6370	It would take considerable eloquence , as well as all his powers of leadership to accomplish it ; but the crisis was upon them , and he would be false to himself if he did not meet the issue squarely .
5.9094	`` Will you listen to me , fellows ? ''
345.2634	he said , quietly , stepping forward to occupy the place just vacated by Jack , and managing to whisper to the other in passing : `` back me up for all you 're worth , and we may win the day ! ''
8.3633	`` Of course we will !
36.6790	You 're the scout leader , Paul , and when you hatch up any game it 's sure to be worth the powder .
9.2651	Let her go ! ''
19.0442	came from Jud , who seemed to be a sort of ringleader in this little rebellion in the camp .
8.8948	`` All right , boys .
248.3614	I 'm going to make a proposition that will take your breath away ; but I have strong hopes that after what you 've listened to from that manual to-night , you 'll be ready to back me up , '' continued Paul .
12.1597	`` We believe in you , Paul .
4.9042	You never fooled us yet ; and you never will .
8.8481	What 's your queer game ? ''
25.3636	asked Bobolink , ready to swing over already , such was his faith in the one they had elected their leader .
114.6998	The boys crowded around Paul , more than eager to hear what his proposal might turn out to be ; for novelty always appeals to the average lad .
3.3978	`` All of you know that old Peleg keeps his dooryard in a horrible condition .
128.4561	Why , my mother says she does n't believe it has been cleaned up in years ; and he hardly ever takes the trouble to even put his wagons and that old buggy in the shed .
2.7598	It 's a disgrace to the town to have him so near .
10.7182	I 've heard that the women talked about asking him to do something to make it look cleaner . ''
26.3024	`` He 's a stubborn old man , and ca n't be driven , my dad says , '' remarked Jud .
8.9704	`` Now here 's what I 'm going to propose .
1.8115	You know he 's pretty deaf , and ca n't hear much that goes on .
224.4783	He used to have a savage dog , but it died a couple of weeks ago , and since then he 's been trying to get another , but so far without success .
9.8583	Get that ? ''
4.6712	`` Yes , but go on , Paul , '' demanded Bobolink .
858.2901	`` Let 's go over to Peleg 's in a body , '' continued the scout leader ; `` and while he sleeps clean up that dooryard of his so that in the morning he 'll just rub his eyes and begin to think the fairies have paid him a visit in the night .
9.3389	And when he learns who did it perhaps he may feel something like you did , William .
5.2292	Do n't you see , _ it 'll be rubbing it in good and hard _ ! ''
14.8541	Paul waited to see how his suggestion took .
7.3107	The boys stared at each other in amazement .
12.5122	It is doubtful whether a parcel of wide-awake lads ever before had such a novel proposition made to them .
17.0791	And perhaps it was the sensational character of the appeal that stirred them more than any desire to return good for evil .
4.6031	`` Count me in that job , Paul , '' said Jack positively .
7.9429	He had timed his interruption with exceeding cleverness .
7.8059	Boys are like sheep , and given a bell wether they will follow blindly where the leader goes .
8.6075	`` Me too ! ''
11.2195	cried Bobolink , quickly .
11.5219	`` Ditto !
8.8571	I 'm for the game just as Paul says ! ''
11.3545	exclaimed Nuthin ' .
437.4545	And every one in the crowd followed suit , laughing at the idea of their turning the tables on the old farmer in such an unheard-of fashion ; though several doubtless secretly scoffed at the project , and only agreed because it seemed to be a necessary evil if they wanted to become Boy Scouts .
7.8018	`` There 's Growdy 's shack and barns ! ''
5.6566	`` Do n't seem to be anything stirring , fellows ! ''
7.8837	`` Look out for a trap .
21.5029	Once bitten , twice shy .
13.9487	Perhaps he 's just laying for some fellers to come along , and play some more paintin ' job trick .
1.6819	I heard that he said he would find some way to stop the nuisance ! ''
139.2059	This from `` Red '' Betts , who was known as a cautious chap , and able to vanish at the first sign of danger better than any fellow in town .
5.2604	`` Suppose we hold up here , and send out scouts to see how the land lies ?
3.0772	That 's the military way of doing it , '' ventured Bobolink .
146.4556	`` A good idea , and I appoint you , Bobolink , with Jud Elderkin , to carry out the little business , '' remarked Paul , in a low tone .
136.1107	`` Trot along , you chaps ; the rest of us will bunk right here alongside the road and wait till you report , '' and suiting the action to his words William dropped in his tracks .
2.9346	A brief time elapsed , and then the pair of spies returned .
12.6618	`` Not a single light in the house , and the coast clear , fellows ; so come on ! ''
11.4343	and Jud waved his long arms as though enjoying his brief assumption of authority to the limit .
4.5415	It would have doubtless astonished the old farmer had he chanced upon the scene just then .
161.9311	A young moon hung in the western sky , and while giving little light , still the figures of some score of stooping boys might have been discovered , advancing in broken formation along the road .
0.4554	The leader silently opened the gate leading to the dooryard of Growdy 's place .
7.0861	His barns stood near the house , so that the confusion which reigned was all the more noticeable .
302.2176	Its equal had never been known around Stanhope ; and could only be expected in the case of a place where a woman 's influence for cleanliness had been totally absent during the past ten years .
6.1565	Over to the stable went some of the boys .
34.1913	Paul had talked it all over with them as they walked , and each knew what part he was to take in the general clean-up .
2.3367	To some of them it was simply another form of a lark .
1.6951	Boys are queer creatures even to those who imagine they know them well .
7.6668	They must be doing something all the time .
104.1859	Once get them started in the right direction , and they will labor just as sturdily to bring about a good object , as under other conditions , they would work to play a joke .
7.5601	It all depends on how they begin .
20.0064	And thanks to the sagacity of Paul , he had succeeded in interesting them in the novelty of his proposal .
20.3077	Some secured rakes and hoes , and began to systematically gather up the scattered loose material that covered the place , ankle deep .
7.9782	Others pushed the wagons , and the old dilapidated buggy , back into the shed in systematic order .
11.5310	They worked like busy bees , chuckling , whispering and evidently getting considerable fun out of the strange frolic .
37.8021	Paul himself went over the job to make sure that it had been thoroughly done , and that nothing remained uncared for .
15.9665	Up to this time fortune had favored the busy workers , since no sound had come about to betray their presence .
13.9507	`` How is it , Paul ? ''
0.5965	asked Jack Stormways , as he ran across the other in making his rounds .
9.5601	`` About at the end .
8.5192	The boys are putting the old tools back where they found them ; and then we can go home .
45.9606	It 's the best half hour 's work any of us have done for a good while , I tell you , Jack . ''
21.9354	`` Some of the boys do n't seem to think it quite so funny now as when they started in .
25.2405	They say they ca n't see where the pay is going to come in , and have begun to grumble , '' whispered the other .
4.7101	`` Perhaps it never will , and again , who knows what might come out of this ?
4.1952	Anyhow , the ladies will be glad to see this dirty place clean for once .
9.6316	Some others I know may take a notion that if Old Growdy can clean up they ought to .
11.2113	Listen !
7.7569	what in the world is that ? ''
135.3223	A rattling of tin pans came to their ears , as if one of the boys in prowling around had accidently upset a bench on which a milk bucket and some flat tinware had been airing .
8.5137	`` That settles it !
1.8675	He 'll hear all that row and be out on us in a jiffy ! ''
0.4405	said Paul , annoyed because the affair had not gone off according to schedule .
10.1437	`` Look !
6.7762	there 's a light sprung up inside the house .
7.3135	He 's getting his trousers on , all right , and the sooner we skip out the better ! ''
20.4656	declared Jack .
98.8068	The boys now came running from every direction , while sounds from within the nearby farmhouse told that Old Peleg must be switching on his heavy boots .
37.8698	So Paul , knowing that the only thing left now was a hasty flight , gave the signal arranged for .
10.2106	It meant every fellow for himself until they had put a reasonable distance between themselves and the seat of danger .
171.8622	Then they could meet at a given place , and go home , laughing over the whole affair , and wondering what Peleg would think when he saw what a miraculous transformation had taken place while he slept .
10.6990	Paul happened to be the very last to run away .
465.8981	Instead of passing out by way of the gate as most of the others did , Paul started to pass over the fence at an inviting point , where two of the bars seemed to be down , and he could gain the adjoining woodlot , from which he might reach the road at his pleasure .
9.2169	But alas !
8.6105	the best of plans often go amiss .
0.2226	And that gap that yawned in the fence proved a delusion and a snare .
208.1188	Hardly had Paul made the jump over the two lower bars than he found himself suddenly jerked down , and his head came with a crash on the ground , causing him to see a myriad of stars .
8.2508	Nor was this all .
118.2885	An unknown power at the same time seemed to lift his lower extremities up in the air at least two feet , so that he appeared to be trying to swim on dry land .
83.8456	For a moment he was puzzled to account for this remarkable happening ; but as his head cleared a bit , and the stars ceased to shoot before his mental vision , he began to get an idea as to what had happened .
69.7153	Apparently the fellows who had painted the farmer 's pigs on the other night must have entered his place from the woods , and through this gap in the fence .
53.2276	Old Peleg had remembered , and anticipating another invasion sooner or later , he had succeeded in arranging some sort of ingenious trap on the spot .
216.8968	In jumping Paul had set off the trigger , with the consequence that a noose had instantly tightened around his ankles , and a hogshead partly filled with stones , starting to roll down the slope , had drawn his legs upward .
48.1920	Well , at any rate there he was , clinging to the grass , and with an unseen force pulling at his elevated feet , so that he was helpless to assist himself .
10.3325	It was very funny , no doubt , but Paul hardly felt like laughing , just then .
31.2130	He tried to wriggle around so as to get at the loop , in the hope that he might loosen the same ; but all his efforts were wasted .
20.2346	Old Peleg had builded better than he expected when he set that trap in which to catch his tormentors .
7.1962	He was coming now to see the result of his cunning .
71.1916	No doubt he had heard the tremendous rattle as the bulging barrel of stones started to roll down the slope after being liberated ; for even a deaf man could hardly have missed that racket .
32.8725	Lantern in hand he was even now hobbling along , chuckling in anticipation of what he would find in his trap .
10.6441	Closer came the limping farmer .
59.2100	Paul saw now that he held a vicious black whip in his right hand , while gripping a lighted lantern in the other .
1.4875	Laughter in the distance told that the boys had all taken themselves off .
15.4479	They could not suspect what a dire calamity had befallen their leader , or a rescue party must have certainly been formed .
116.6758	Another minute and Peleg had arrived at the fence , and bending over held the lantern so that its light fell upon the figure of his captive .
7.2214	`` Gut ye , have I ?
14.5793	Mebbe ye 'll try to paint some critters of mine agin , an ' mebbe ye wo n't ! ''
47.5050	said the farmer , as he raised the ugly black whip which he held , with the evident intention of bringing it down good and hard on the helpless boy .
15.5499	`` Wait , Mr. Growdy ! ''
20.2344	Paul hastened to exclaim .
5.8251	The old man laughed harshly as he flourished the whip .
45.7712	Perhaps he had never struck a boy before in all his life , and hardly knew how to begin ; but his temper was plainly disturbed , and he meant to make a start .
2.5377	`` What should I wait fur , when I cort ye in the very act ?
4.6967	Paint my critters red , white an ' blue , will ye ?
43.9496	P'raps ye wanted to pull all the feathers out o ' my flock o ' chickens this time , an ' think it funny .
19.6961	Sarve ye right if I gi'e ye a dozen stripes ! ''
9.7662	`` Mr. Growdy , I did you a favor once ! ''
12.8945	said the prisoner of the trap , wishing to keep the old man as long as possible from starting operations .
8.9370	`` Say ye so ?
7.7076	Wall , this wipes it out then .
8.6378	Who air ye , anyway ? ''
14.2049	The farmer bent lower , and thrust his lantern so that its light would fall upon the face of the boy .
3.4669	Immediately he uttered a grunt , for it was plain that he had recognized his captive .
6.3554	`` So , it 's ye , is it , Paul Morrison ?
19.8202	This is some surprise , seein ' as ye 're the last boy I 'd expect to be up ter sech meanness .
4.2778	What d'ye think yer father 'll say w ` en he hears ` bout this ? ''
118.3175	`` I guess he 'll laugh , and say it was about the cutest trick ever played on you , Mr. Growdy , '' came the immediate answer ; `` but please get me down from this .
5.7961	Perhaps the blood will all run to my head .
20.0456	Tie my hands if you want , and fix it so I ca n't run away ; but I could n't stand this long . ''
4.1904	`` So ye think yer father 'd larf , do ye ?
278.4569	I never wud ` a ' b ` lieved Doctor Morrison was the kind o ' man to encourage practical jokes on anybody , '' grumbled the old man , plainly at a loss to understand what was meant .
14.3952	`` Well , he is n't , and I 'd be sorry to have him know I was guilty of such a thing .
101.7531	But you 're barking up the wrong tree , Mr. Growdy , I give you my word we none of us had any trick in mind when we came here to-night . ''
27.1557	`` Then what took you in my dooryard here ; for I heard a pack runnin ' away when I kim out of the house ?
89.4867	Tell me that , Paul , '' insisted the farmer ; but the hand that held that cruel looking whip had fallen to his side , which was a good sign .
1.7646	`` I 'll be only too glad to do so if you let me up .
25.6820	Tie my hands , my legs too if you want , sir ; but I 'm getting dizzy from having my head below my heels . ''
21.7819	Peleg stooped still closer .
877.5383	He again held the lantern down so that he could look into the face of his prisoner ; after which he did something that Paul had hardly expected -- bent over , seized the rope connected with the laden hogshead , and pulling hard succeeded in casting the loop that had just encircled Paul 's ankles , over a post of the fence .
13.5884	`` Get up , Paul ! ''
90.9372	he said , grimly , yet with a flicker of curiosity in his wrinkled face ; as though a dim suspicion that there might be something out of the ordinary back of this , had begun to take possession of his mind .
207.6510	Paul regained his feet , a little wobbly to be sure , for he had experienced a bad fall , and his head felt rather tender where it had come in contact with the hard ground .
15.7827	`` Thank you , Mr. Growdy .
10.5808	And now I 'm going to tell you something .
85.8651	Perhaps you will find it hard to believe me , and again you may not just appreciate our way of taking matters in our own hands , when the request of the women of Stanhope did n't have any effect .
16.4699	Look around your dooryard , Mr. Growdy .
8.4888	Do you see anything changed here ? ''
4.3997	The farmer held up the lantern , and what he saw caused him to utter an exclamation .
13.4874	`` Ev'ry one o ' 'em gone , by hokey !
201.3778	If so be ye 've smashed all my rigs , Paul Morison , I 'll have the law on ye , as sure as my name 's Peleg Growdy ! ''
4.8248	he roared , aghast at what he deemed a serious discovery .
13.5486	`` Come with me , Mr. Growdy .
3.7945	Notice as you go that this place does n't look much like a pigpen now .
0.4563	In fact , I calculate it 's as clean as any dooryard around Stanhope .
16.6749	Even the ladies can drive past now without being shocked .
191.2146	And Mr. Growdy , if you will take the trouble , sir , to look under that wagon shed , you 'll see every one of your vehicles just where they should be when not in use ! ''
6.2652	The old man stared , as well he might .
9.5605	`` By gum ! ''
50.4160	Paul heard him mutter ; and the words seemed to express the situation so well that the boy could hardly keep from laughing outright .
1.8575	Finally the puzzled farmer turned and looked at the lad who stood there beside him .
74.2628	Easily might Paul have made his escape at any time now ; but that was really the last thing he thought of doing .
2.7948	He would much rather remain and see the bewilderment of Peleg Growdy reach its conclusion .
3.0363	`` Look here , Paul , what 's this hull thing mean ? ''
11.2383	finally demanded the farmer .
46.8266	And Paul , remembering the fact that the old man was hard of hearing , raised his voice as he thought fit when making reply .
0.2632	`` Do you want me to tell you the whole thing , sir ? ''
9.9777	`` I sartin do , every word .
3.4518	Blest if I kin make head or tail out o ' it .
106.0643	Reckons as how them leetle fairy twins ye read about must ` a ' ben workin ' wile I slept ; er else I 'm dreamin ' things that caint be true . ''
13.0008	`` Listen , Mr. Growdy , '' Paul went on .
17.4412	`` Perhaps you may not know that we have started a troop of the Boy Scouts here in Stanhope .
65.1467	Some twenty of us have joined , and later on we hope to get uniforms , and other things needed , when we have earned the money to buy them .
24.8938	Those boys you heard running away were my friends and comrades , every one going to be a true scout . ''
100.7892	`` Soldier bummers then , out on a raid , and ready to kerry off everything they kin lay hands on , '' grumbled the old man , still unable to grasp the true condition of affairs .
19.7513	`` At a meeting to-night in Mr. Shipley 's barn we made further progress looking to perfecting our organization .
245.5165	But boys will be boys , you know ; and one of our number asked the rest to help him get even with you , because you forced him into the ditch this afternoon , upsetting his wagon . ''
15.8814	Old Growdy moved uneasily .
9.9475	`` I was real sorry to see William do that .
92.3991	If he 'd only waited till I lighted my pipe I ` spected to pull out a leetle more , so 's to let him git by ; but he was that impatient he must push on , '' he said .
8.5989	`` Just as I thought .
87.4103	Well , Mr. Growdy , one of the rules of the scouts is that a member must never return an evil deed by another of the same kind .
1.8920	I proposed that we try to make you change your mind about detesting all boys .
466.7609	So we came here , not to paint your pigs as some other fellows did , I 'm told ; not to let your stock loose , or run off with your wagons ; but to clean up your dooryard , and give you the greatest surprise of your life when you came out in the morning ! ''
11.4382	`` Sho !
20.9248	now .
8.3070	That takes the cake ! ''
279.4864	`` When one of my chums upset that bench by accident , and the pans fell with a racket , of course it gave the whole thing away , and we started to run ; but unfortunately I happened to drop into your nice little trap , and you found me upside down .
16.4061	That is all , Mr. Growdy .
10.9564	Do you want to whip me now , or take me in to the lockup , which ? ''
38.0687	Peleg Growdy found himself strangely thrilled as he looked into that frank , smiling face of Paul Morrison .
14.2626	For almost a full minute they stood thus .
20.3375	Then Peleg spoke .
50.0989	`` Reckon as how them comrades o ' yers must ` a ' gut a long start by now , Paul .
1.6941	S'pose ye see if ye kin ketch up with 'em , son . ''
97.3752	That was all , but as Paul hurried off he was conscious of a strange feeling deep down in his breast ; and he felt sure that after all it had paid .
8.0285	Peleg Growdy at least had met with the surprise of his life .
133.1120	After this possibly his ideas of juvenile depravity might undergo a violent change ; for such positive natures as his usually swing from one extreme to the other , just like the pendulum of a grandfather clock .
14.0301	Paul did not catch up with his fleeing comrades , for they had secured too good a start .
41.3408	When he reached the rendezvous , however , he found them there , one and all , and wondering what could have happened to detain him .
434.6606	Loud were the expressions of astonishment as he calmly announced that having been caught in a trap , he had held a face to face talk with Peleg Growdy himself ; when he managed to relate the whole surprising adventure the boys were stunned at the possible consequences of their little prank .
62.9869	Those who had considered it only in the light of a joke began to see that Paul had something deeper in mind when he proposed such a thing .
22.3368	All the way home Paul was kept busy repeating some of the things he had said to the irate farmer .
4.2547	It gave those lads something to ponder over when by themselves .
15.0615	Possibly they had never before realized what a powerful lever for good such a method of returning a grudge may become .
18.2779	Paul himself was delighted .
137.5179	Even if nothing more came of it he could look back to the little adventure with satisfaction such as Ted Slavin and his cronies might never feel with regard to their prank .
56.2380	And the next morning Paul was not at all ashamed to relate the entire circumstance at the breakfast table .
202.7592	He felt amply repaid when he saw the look of pride upon his mother 's face , as she turned her eyes , filled with unshed tears , upon him and said gently : `` I am glad you did it , Paul .
116.5507	I know the history of poor Peleg Growdy ; and surely he has had enough of trouble during his life to make him different from the rest of his kind .
103.2965	The milk of human kindness has perhaps been dried up in his breast ; yet who knows , my boy , but that you may have set him to thinking by that one little act of yours .
6.8402	I shall never fear for you , Paul , whatever betides . ''
382.2720	His father , the doctor , was a man of few words ; but that morning when he was going off on his round of visits he did an unusual thing -- took Paul 's hand , and gave it an affectionate squeeze , while the look that accompanied the action needed no further explanation .
17.1571	And Paul was many times satisfied .
4.8092	That day and others saw a growing buzz of excitement in the town of Stanhope .
235.1741	It seemed as though nearly every boy over the age of twelve , yes and even under , might be filled with a burning zeal to join the new troops that were being started under two different scout leaders .
1540.5796	Ward Kenwood had entered heart and soul into the work , which seemed to appeal to him ; but there were those who secretly believed he was more concerned about opposing his rival , Paul Morrison , than in building up a second troop of scouts that would be a credit to the place .
5.7657	Ted Slavin , of course , worked hand in glove with his friend , Ward .
183.7594	If money counted for anything they had no reason to complain ; for inside of a week there blossomed out numerous boys clad in the new khaki uniforms that distinguish the Boy Scouts everywhere .
63.8945	Some of Paul 's friends felt grieved because they had failed to get their equipments as soon as the others ; but nothing could disturb the scout leader .
19.1727	`` You 'll see that they are bound to meet up with a snag when they apply for admission to the real organization .
5.6532	They ca n't subscribe to many of the rules .
3.6884	Then again you know that the real scout scorns to receive his uniform as a gift .
9.0462	Everything he owns must be earned .
4.1850	But most of us are nearly ready to send for suits .
11.0500	Wait a little longer .
5.6627	The race is not always to the swift . ''
11.4137	In this fashion then did wise Paul bring peace to the troubled hearts of those anxious ones .
234.7460	Never a member of the new Fox Patrols that sought an interview with the scout leader but who came away feeling that there was not a cloud in the sky of their future .
153.3901	In this manner a week , and then ten days , drifted along , with the opening of school looming up in the near future .
467.2405	Paul had almost forgotten the troubles of his chum when one day he had the fact suddenly brought to his attention again , as Jack came upon him with a face upon which rested the same old cloud of anxiety and grief .
10.4529	`` There , some more gone , Paul ! ''
196.3539	`` But it 's nearly ten days since we talked it over last , and then there were , let me see , I believe six coins left , '' returned the other , quickly .
8.8720	`` That 's true enough .
540.3457	And I can see now that you 're wondering why none have been taken all this time , up to to-day , '' remarked Jack , as he came alongside his chum , who was looking in at a window where sporting goods made a brave display .
2.8960	`` Will Carlo hang around and wait for you a bit ? ''
196.0020	asked Paul , looking with a smile toward the big Newfoundland dog that had been trotting at the heels of his young master , carrying a basket , in which were several packages from the store .
11.4864	`` Sure .
13.3168	He 's well trained , and that is one of the smallest of his stunts , as you know .
0.2055	See , he has laid the basket down , and stands guard over it .
5.5597	I dare any dog in Stanhope to try and take it away .
0.4310	Now , you want to know about my poor old batch of coins ! ''
107.2678	`` I 'm waiting to hear , old fellow , '' said Paul , tenderly ; for he could see that his chum was once again highly charged with emotion .
5.9243	`` I thought I 'd try a scheme unbeknown to you , '' began the other , slowly .
40.0953	`` Perhaps I can guess what you did -- was it that you locked the door of your little den , Jack ? ''
1067.5495	`` Well , now , you are a champion guesser , for that was just what I did , every day up to this one -- shut down the window , locked the door , and never went up there once , '' replied his comrade , with surprise written on his face .
7.9411	`` And nothing was missing ? ''
9.5200	`` Not a coin .
49.7629	I counted six myself this morning when I went upstairs just to get something out of the snuggery . ''
5.3645	`` Did you forget to lock it after you , Jack ? ''
4.5495	`` No ; but an idea came to me .
45.2357	At the time I thought it a bright one ; but now I 'm more than half sorry I ever tried it . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
5.5550	then you left the door unlocked again on purpose ? ''
4.3523	`` Yes , and with the window open , at that .
12.1096	The invitation was plain enough , '' murmured Jack , with dejection in his voice and manner .
22.1226	Paul seemed to ponder over the matter ; and indeed it was quite enough to try any boy 's wits .
10.2371	`` Do you happen to know if any fellow called to see you to-day while you were out ? ''
9.6469	he asked , presently .
120.5180	`` Now , I thought of that , and asked both my brother and Maggie to pay particular attention to it , if any boy stopped over , hoping I would come in . ''
9.5949	`` Nothing doing ? ''
56.1959	`` It 's kind of queer , but do you know , for a wonder not a single fellow has been at our house this blessed day .
60.4033	Generally half a dozen call to see me , you know , to borrow books from my library , or talk over matters connected with our school society .
286.9830	It just looks as if everything wanted to mix me up worse than ever , and make me think -- '' `` Never mind what it makes you think , '' interrupted Paul , quickly , squeezing the arm of his chum affectionately ; `` let 's get down to facts .
221.0445	You know I promised that I 'd find out the truth about this matter ; and while up to now I 've given it mighty little attention , do n't think that I 've forgotten , Jack . ''
81.3656	`` I do n't ; only it bothers me to understand how you can ever expect to find out who 's taking my old coins , if I 've made a mess of it ; and living in the house at that ! ''
4.5710	rejoined the other , with bewilderment plainly visible on his face .
7.4648	`` Leave that to me .
58.9194	I repeat my promise , and if everything else fails why , what 's going to hinder my hiding up there behind some of your stuff , where I can see for myself what happens ? ''
8.4583	`` Oh ! ''
49.2644	exclaimed Jack , `` that would be a clever idea ; but much as I want to know the truth , I 'm afraid to ! ''
3.4729	`` Well , you 've got to get over that feeling .
8.5573	No matter what happens it 's far better to know the worst ; for then it may be remedied .
24.2548	I 've heard my father tell of many a desperate case where only heroic treatment , as he called it , brought his patient through .
3.0994	We 've just got to try it here , Jack , old fellow .
9.9755	Hello !
7.9697	what d'ye suppose all that row 's about ? ''
64.1012	`` Sounds to me like a runaway horse , from the shouts , '' declared Jack , quickly forgetting his own personal troubles in the new excitement .
10.1437	`` Look !
2.5103	There 's the runaway , and coming this way around the corner .
9.9755	Oh !
7.7906	it was nearly over that time !
6.9217	My heart was in my mouth ! ''
21.0516	cried Paul .
3.7053	`` There 's some one in the wagon , Paul , a little child ! ''
42.6865	almost shrieked Jack ; for the clamor was deafening by now , and ordinary sounds could never have been heard .
15.2314	No need to tell Paul that .
1.7333	He had just made the astounding discovery himself , and was thrilled with sudden horror .
129.3662	It was a little boy who was tugging at the lines with a heroism worthy of one twice his size ; but such a young person could make no impression on the hard mouth of that terrorized animal .
61.1606	In the sudden whirl around the corner the lad had come very near being thrown but , and was even now unsteadily trying to regain his balance .
3.6517	Paul knew that it was an occasion for quick thinking , and even faster doing !
120.5574	He bounded away from the side of his chum as though on springs , leaving Jack standing there on the curb , filled with eager anticipation , and fears .
102.5344	It was not _ toward _ the rapidly advancing horse that the boy ran , but in exactly the opposite direction , as though he were being chased .
98.7161	With the wagon flinging about from side to side , and hindering the progress of the runaway to some extent , Paul believed that he could almost hold his own in the race .
5.3836	Little by little he meant to let the horse overtake him .
206.7055	Then , at just the right second his chance would come to jump at the animal 's head , seize upon the lines close to the bit , and throw his entire weight upon them .
12.7319	He knew that it called for good judgment , since the slightest mistake would be apt to cost him dear .
19.1262	To be thrown under the iron-shod hoofs of the galloping animal might mean making him a cripple for the rest of his life .
21.1136	Even that possibility did not daunt Paul .
103.8843	He only saw the frightened face of the little chap who so valorously clung to the lines , and shouted shrilly at the top of his childish voice , as though expecting the usually tractable horse to mind .
65.8933	A human life in peril -- that was one of the cardinal points that must call for action on the part of a true Boy Scout .
68.2281	He might refuse to engage in a sanguinary battle with some rival who had dared him to a fight ; but under no conditions must he hold back when the chance offered to do a good deed .
5.9588	Now the horse was just behind him , and still galloping furiously .
24.4058	If anything , the animal was making more desperate headway than ever , for the outcries on every side seemed to add to his fright .
7.6324	Every eye was focussed on the runner .
17.0965	One man in a vehicle had drawn in his horse , and with white cheeks watched the remarkable scene .
39.1932	If any among that throng had reason to send up a silent prayer for the safety of that daring lad just then , surely he might .
6.9723	For the man in the buggy was Doctor Alan Morrison , Paul 's own father !
385.1725	Five seconds passed , but it seemed an hour , a day , a life-time to that man , as his heart ceased to beat , and he gripped the reins convulsively in his clenched hands .
14.4854	Then the heavens seemed to almost split with the sudden outburst of wild shouts that raced up and down that street .
7.3557	`` He 's done it !
11.9381	Hurrah !
8.4640	The boy 's stopped him !
28.3404	Bully for Paul Morrison ! ''
3.4454	Men shouted , boys shrieked , while women embraced in their tears .
140.5050	The tense strain was over , for willing hands had clutched the lines after Paul 's weight had brought the wild runaway to a staggering halt ; and the danger was past .
69.4113	Then ensued a wild scene , everybody trying to get hold of the boy who had known what to do in an emergency , and not only that , but had done it .
294.6229	Confused , overwhelmed , Paul in the great confusion tried to flee ; but while he did manage to duck under many of the hands outstretched to clutch him , it was only to dart into the arms of some one who pressed him to his heart .
43.0644	And looking up the boy saw above him the face of one whom he loved -- his father , who had been a witness to his adventure .
3.7148	`` That was well done , my boy ; and I 'm glad I saw it ! ''
13.1411	was all the good doctor said ; but Paul never forgot the proud look that accompanied the words .
252.0319	It would return to him many times in the distant future , when he might be tempted by the fascinations of the world to turn aside from the narrow path which he had chosen to tread ; and must ever be a guide and beacon for his footsteps .
276.1557	Then came Jack , with William , Tom Betts and Bluff Shipley , all nearly wild over the fact that it was their chum who had acquitted himself so well .
232.3925	Before Paul could make his escape he found his hand gripped by the father of the child in the wagon , who happened to be a prosperous farmer , with whom Doctor Morrison was well acquainted .
12.2131	`` I never could tell you what I think about this , my boy , '' he said , with deep feeling .
0.1980	`` The child 's mother 'll never forget you , be sure of that .
577.7653	And it ai n't right for me to offer you any reward for doing such a fine thing ; but I want you to buy something with this ten dollars , that every time you look at it you 'll remember little Tod Perkins , what owed his life to you . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
10.7514	I could n't think of it , Mr. Perkins .
3.6663	Why , it was just pie to me , you know .
6.5955	Please do n't make me take it ! ''
36.8992	said the boy , still more confused ; but the farmer had already turned away to embrace his child , and there seemed nothing for it but to accept the gift .
221.6816	`` Do n't offend him by refusing , Paul ; he means well , and perhaps you can buy something with it that will serve as a reminder , '' said the doctor , always trying to avoid hurting other people 's feelings .
6.3843	`` Why , sure , what 's to hinder you buying your scout 's uniform with it ? ''
18.3269	declared William at this juncture .
3.2303	`` You certain earned it , if anybody ever did work for what they got ! ''
12.2507	avowed Bobolink , positively .
9.2169	`` Oh !
15.1003	w-w-why was n't it m-m-me ? ''
10.2952	wailed Bluff , in pretended grief .
15.1411	`` Say , do you think you could have nailed that runaway horse , with such an impediment twisting you up ? ''
11.5287	demanded Bobolink , grinning .
364.3454	`` Well , boys , since you say so , I suppose then I 'll just have to accept it , and call my outfit earned by the sweat of my brow , '' laughed Paul , taking out his handkerchief to wipe his face from its collection of perspiration and dust .
13.1041	Paul and his chum managed to break away finally , and walk toward the home of the latter .
130.7989	Jack had his arm through that of the other , and it seemed as though he felt happier over the recent exploit than the one who had occupied the centre of the stage .
9.4215	`` My heart seemed to be up in my mouth just when you made that grab for the bit .
118.6409	I believe I would have fallen in a fit if you had gone under , Paul , '' said Jack , with a big sigh , as he pressed the arm he held .
3.2771	`` Well , I was a little worried myself that something might upset me just then .
7.1422	But luck favored me , you know .
16.3966	I 'm more than glad , because it would have given my mother a bad shock if I 'd been trampled on .
11.6685	But please drop that subject , old fellow , '' said Paul , making a wry face .
11.4222	`` I will , since you ask it ; but they wo n't forget it in the town for a long time .
8.1858	Such things happen only once a year or more around dull old Stanhope .
31.2168	To-night we meet to see how many have the money earned for the suits ; and I 'm glad to say I can cover my needs .
9.6133	You 're doubly supplied now , with this windfall . ''
24.2894	`` Yes , and I wish I could help some other fellow out ; but I 'm afraid that would be against the rules of the game .
78.0910	Here we are at your house , and bless me if Carlo has n't carried that basket of provisions straight back to the kitchen door .
0.8094	Say , he _ is _ a trump , sure enough , Jack . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.4637	that 's dead easy for Carlo .
33.4374	Why , we often put a nickel in the basket , and send him down to the bakery for a loaf of bread , '' laughed the other .
6.0262	`` And does he always get it ? ''
19.5734	asked Paul , looking suddenly interested .
10.0034	`` I do n't believe he 's failed for six months .
23.4287	Of course Mr. Crusty knows what we want , and wraps the loaf up so as to keep the dust off .
1.6553	Why , that ai n't the best of his tricks , by a long shot .
146.7221	I taught him when he was hungry to go -- '' `` Excuse me , wo n't you , Jack ; there comes father , and I do believe he 's heading home long before his usual time .
8.2048	Perhaps he 's afraid mother may hear that something has happened to me , and would be anxious .
3.4836	I 'd better jump in with him , do n't you think ?
1.9317	Another time I 'll hear all about the wonderful stunts of Carlo . ''
2.9996	And so speaking Paul ran out to join his father in the buggy .
13.6455	Jack looked after him , and sighed heavily .
75.8844	It was not that he felt a particle jealous of the recent exploit which his chum had engineered so successfully ; for envy was not one of his failings .
25.6246	But he did wish that his mind was as free from anxiety and suspicion as that of Paul Morrison .
36.8111	For the mystery of those disappearing coins hung about his neck like a millstone , nor could he ever know peace again until in some way it were explained .
232.2145	What happened at the Morrison home when the doctor told the story of his boy 's heroism no one ever knew ; for Paul was not the one to betray family secrets .
1341.2275	But Jack , who understood what an affectionate mother his chum had , could easily imagine how she wrapped her arms about the boy , and pressed him again and again to her bosom , thanking Heaven that the child she had watched grow from babyhood until he was now almost as tall as his father , should show signs of proving himself a worthy successor to the `` good Doctor , '' as every one knew him .
251.6298	That night the boys had the darkness to contend with when they started for the place of meeting , though the late moon might show her smiling face before the time came for them to return home .
1152.3332	There were just twenty-two who reported at roll call that evening at eight , and one need only glance around at the faces of the boys , both large and small , to be positive that the enthusiasm , instead of dying out , was increasing by leaps and bounds .
50.1949	When the meeting had been called to order , the one subject that interested those gathered was the question of obtaining their uniforms and other outfit .
123.9027	A warm discussion arose shortly when Jack asked for information concerning the right of any scout to assist a fellow member who might be behind in earning the necessary amount .
97.8239	Some believed one way , while others seemed to look at it in another light , and not a few were , as Jack said , `` on the fence . ''
27.7161	`` Listen , fellows , and I 'll tell you what I gathered from studying the books on the Boy Scout movement loaned me by the minister .
13.1140	Here are twenty or more of us , and we need just so much money for an outfit .
12.5608	Some can show much more than they need , others fall short , although they may have worked even harder .
12.6035	Is that plain ? ''
2.9900	and Jack looked around at the eager faces as he put the question .
274.5857	`` It certainly is , '' remarked Paul , smiling ; `` some are born rich , others earn riches , and once in a while some lucky chap has the money stuck right in his hand .
13.4775	I 'm one of the last class .
33.8251	But go on , Jack ; for I know you 've got a bright idea that may help us out of this hole . ''
7.8966	`` The answer is easy , fellows .
8.3386	We must make a common fund .
7.1752	Then every member can put in all he wants , so long as it has been honestly earned .
8.9744	See my plan ? ''
7.5184	`` Sure , and it goes .
6.7301	That 's the answer to the problem .
136.6973	Let 's try it out and see how near we can come to the amount needed , '' said Jud Elderkin , briskly ; starting to pass around slips of paper and a pencil .
41.8968	`` Put down what you can hand over to the general fund , each fellow ; and remember it means cash , to be delivered to-morrow , and not credit , '' he announced .
216.9200	There was the utmost eagerness to carry out the idea , and before five minutes had passed every boy had written his name on a slip of paper , together with the full amount which he could contribute to the general fund .
121.4685	`` I appoint Jud and Bobolink a committee to canvass the vote , and count up the amount subscribed , '' said Paul , as chairman of the meeting .
116.7368	It did not take very long , though the two boys were seen to go over their figures several times in order to make sure there could be no error .
7.1715	`` Look at the grins on their faces !
7.1016	Do n't that tell the story , fellows !
11.3879	Hurrah ! ''
11.2823	shouted Nuthin ' .
93.7316	And when the amount was declared it was found that it far exceeded the actual sum needed to purchase uniforms for the entire twenty-two scouts , including hats and leggings .
1.7382	`` Do n't forget that I 've just got to have a bugle , fellows .
0.2574	What use is it to be elected bugler if you ca n't bugle ? ''
12.3815	exclaimed Bobolink .
13.1727	`` And m-m-me for a d-d-d-d-d-drum ! ''
15.5354	echoed Bluff , excitedly ; when he was immediately pounced upon as usual , and pounded several times on the back .
5.6473	`` Yes , do get Bluff something he can beat .
0.1889	I 've heard him drum , and he 's just a corker at it .
4.5587	It keeps him from talking , you know , '' laughed Tom Betts .
8.4583	`` Hello ! ''
4.1403	exclaimed Nuthin ' suddenly ; `` look who 's here , fellows ! ''
42.6090	All eyes were immediately turned toward the door , and focussed upon the figure that stood just within the barn , having entered while they were boisterously exchanging these compliments .
12.4720	`` Why , it 's Mr. Growdy ! ''
19.8725	said Paul .
14.1464	`` Old Peleg ! ''
9.0890	echoed Bobolink , in a hushed tone .
250.7422	One and all stared at the crusty old farmer , who for years had avoided all boys as though he thought them a dangerous breed of animals which it were safer to let severely alone .
571.4624	When Paul saw the amused smile creeping over the rugged and seamed face of the old farmer he understood that Peleg had really experienced a wonderful change of heart , dating from that night when the new Boy Scouts cleaned up his dooryard as an object lesson .
156.9675	And now Peleg was coming slowly forward , looking a bit awkward ; since he had never been accustomed to facing an audience , and especially one composed of boys .
7.4232	They made way for him , so that presently he found himself completely surrounded by an eager throng .
432.5018	`` Glad to see you , Mr. Growdy , '' said Paul , holding out his hand impulsively ; and to the surprise of the others it was eagerly seized upon by the calloused fingers of the toiler in the fields ; `` these are the friends I spoke to you about .
1.6472	And this is the Fox Patrol of the newly organized Boy Scouts . ''
8.0529	Peleg grinned , and acknowledged the introduction by ducking his touseled head .
7.4130	`` Glad to meet ye , boys .
214.9355	I 've be 'n hearin ' quite considerable ` bout what ye was adoin ' over here , an ' I thort as how I 'd jest drap in to see ye all ; sorter like returnin ' yer call , so to speak ! ''
1.7404	he said , again allowing a humorous look to appear upon his face .
71.1266	And somehow the boys instantly concluded that when Peleg allowed the lines of his severe face to relax , he was rather a jolly old chap after all .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
33.0801	Three cheers for Mr. Peleg Growdy ! ''
10.5887	exclaimed one of those who felt relieved to think that his coming meant no trouble after all .
8.1711	But the farmer raised his hand .
4.6616	`` Jest wait till I has my little say , boys .
216.7119	Now , at fust I was kinder riled that a passel o ' boys shud ` a ' took me to task on account o ' my way o ' lettin ' things run loose like at my place .
13.8221	But I gotter thinkin ' her over , and by hokey if it did n't jest come home to me .
1105.3749	Times was when my dooryard was the puttiest around all Stanhope , with the flowers abloomin ' , an ' every scrap tidied up ; but in them happy days Mandy an ' the kids was there , ye see ; an ' sense they was took it ` peared like I never cared what things looked like ; an ' that 's a fact , boys . ''
447.0609	The old man seemed to swallow something that threatened to choke him ; and then , while the boys hung on his every word , and wondered how they had ever come to misunderstand him as they had , he went on : `` But I kim to the conclusion , arter thet kind visit ye paid me , thet I owed a duty to the community , and it war n't right for any citizen to let his place look disgraceful .
189.5790	So arter this nobody ai n't agoin ' to be ashamed to pass by the yard where Mandy ` tended the rose bushes , and her tots played from morn to night .
21.6476	I jest drapped in here to thank ye right hearty boys , for showin ' me wot was wantin ' .
21.2919	Arter this there ai n't never agoin ' to be any trouble between me an ' the boys o ' Stanhope .
70.1435	They kin count on old Peleg Growdy to contribute to every sport that goes to cultivate the mind and body in the right direction ! ''
95.9650	He seemed a vastly different man as he stood there and said this , for his head was thrown back , his eyes flashed , and his face was almost friendly in its expression , the old haggard look having for the time being disappeared .
10.8091	`` Again I say , three cheers for Mr. Growdy ! ''
27.3780	called Joe Clausin .
8.7652	`` Wait a bit , fellers .
42.8842	I got somethin' more to say , '' pleaded the old man , once again lifting his hand to still the rising tumult .
170.4472	Paul smiled , for he could give a pretty shrewd guess as to what was coming ; and it certainly did him good to realize how their odd little scheme was turning out to be such a glorious success .
6.6164	Every voice was hushed , and once more the throng waited for the farmer to explain .
18.9963	`` I 've been ahearin ' a good lot about wot ye 're all adoin ' with this Boy Scout business .
36.7996	Kinder got me interested , an ' I borried some books o ' the dominie jest so I could understand wot 't was all about .
3.7441	An ' I want to say I like the ijee fust rate .
40.7273	If I hed any boys o ' my own , '' and his voice faltered right there , `` I 'd sure encourage 'em to jine in with ye .
128.5121	Seein ' as I ai n't , an ' on account o ' the good turn ye done me t ` other night , boys , I 'm goin ' to ask a favor o ' ye .
267.0909	I ai n't got nary a kid to leave my money to when I go ; and so I hope ye 'll let me pay for fittin ' this here Fox Patrol out with uniforms !
19.3089	That 's my ijee , boys , an ' it 'll give me great joy if so be ye take me up ! ''
8.3705	They looked at each other for a minute , speechless with astonishment .
4.2326	Then being real boys they found their voices with a rush .
10.3769	No need now for Tom Butts or Joe Clausin to suggest three cheers .
59.9775	That old barn fairly rocked with the volume of sound that burst forth , as every fellow swung his hat in the air , and tried his best to give his feelings free rein .
10.0311	`` Silence ! ''
40.2508	The tumult died away as quickly as it had sprung into being , when Paul held up his right hand and made this request .
473.2667	All being still again , he turned to the grinning old farmer , who was doubtless getting more solid satisfaction out of this new experience than he had obtained from any clever dicker or trade engineered in the last ten years .
397.0688	`` Mr. Growdy , '' said Paul , with considerable of feeling in his voice , `` as the present scout leader of Stanhope Troop No. 1 of the Boy Scouts , I want to thank you sincerely for your generous offer .
0.1868	We all appreciate the kindly spirit that causes you to make it to us .
4.7075	But unfortunately it happens that the rules of our organization will not allow us to accept . ''
13.5608	Peleg 's face fell several degrees at this .
1.8789	`` Say , could n't ye jest make an exception this time , boys ? ''
10.4325	he pleaded .
7.6674	`` I 'll feel right hurt if I ai n't ` lowed to help on this business some .
26.5527	Wot 's a hundred dollars beside the new speerit ye 've managed somehow to start up in me ?
8.9732	If ye need more , by gum !
7.6997	ye kin hev it !
8.8058	I ai n't no hog , if I hev let the people think so this long time . ''
0.4102	`` Sorry to say so , Mr. Growdy , but we ca n't accept .
308.7750	Besides , we have all earned enough money now to pay for what we need , and expect to send away to-morrow to get our suits , '' Paul went on ; and even while he was talking a bright idea came flashing into his brain .
8.1501	`` Wall , now that 's jest too bad , boys .
90.3112	I 'd calkerlated to spend that hundred on doin ' a good deed , an ' ye make me go back home with the same hugged tight in my pocket .
83.0391	I 'm sorry it cai n't be did , I am , sure , '' muttered the farmer , shaking his head , and acting like a child that has been cheated out of some anticipated pleasure .
859.4119	`` That does n't follow , Mr. Growdy , '' said Paul , in a low but thrilling voice ; `` if you have set your mind on using that hundred dollars to do a good work , perhaps I might give you a hint where it would fit in mighty well , and make your heart feel warm . ''
9.2169	`` Hey !
16.8914	wot 's that , Paul ?
6.3577	I do n't understand , '' exclaimed the man .
681.1442	`` Down just beyond the outskirts of Stanhope there lives a poor widow woman who , I 'm told , is in danger of being put out of her home any day now because she has been sick and unable to work so as to pay her rent .
430.3849	If you went to her right now , Mr. Growdy , and put that wad of money in her hand , I 'm sure you 'd never regret it , sir ; and every boy here would thank you just as much as if you paid for his uniform .
8.0313	Is n't that so , fellows ? ''
85.2780	A chorus of shouts testified to the fact that Paul had hit upon a popular idea for turning the sudden generosity of the hitherto miserly old farmer to account .
7.5903	`` Who is the woman ? ''
30.1481	asked Peleg Growdy uneasily .
11.2805	`` Mrs. Jenks , who has three little children to support .
184.3151	Her husband was killed in that blast some years ago , and she never recovered a cent from the mining company , for they burst like a bubble , '' returned Paul .
10.9014	`` By gum !
16.8791	wot d'ye know about that , now ?
144.8649	I reckons as how she lives in one o ' my own cottages , which the real estate man , Stebbins , takes keer of fur me .
55.0775	He was tellin ' me about some tenant he 'd have to put out ; but I never noticed more 'n that the name was Jenks . ''
15.8920	`` But now ? ''
21.2323	ventured Paul .
7.3991	`` It wo n't be did !
9.5713	No , sir , not by a jugful .
7.0760	I got my team outside , an ' I 'm goin ' straight over to see the widder .
108.1419	I knowed her husband onct too , an ' I 'm some ` shamed thet I did n't look her up afore , '' and Peleg started for the door .
13.6372	`` Hold on , Mr. Growdy ! ''
19.6939	called Paul .
9.2169	`` Hey !
14.1178	wot 's doin ' now , boys ? ''
3.8064	demanded the old man , turning to grin again at his new host of young friends .
19.8751	`` You ought n't to leave here , sir , without giving every boy scout the privilege of shaking hands with you .
26.1388	I 'm sure I speak for each fellow when I ask that favor , '' returned Paul , stepping forward .
353.5874	Peleg was agreeable , though he blushed like a schoolboy as the scouts , forming in line , walked past him , each seizing his horny hand eagerly , and doing his best to make the old farmer wince with the warmth of his squeeze .
25.2665	They gave him a parting cheer as he passed out , and the old fellow tried to return the military salute to the best of his ability .
3.7381	`` Well , what do you think of that ? ''
27.4746	asked Nuthin ' , when they were once more gathered around their leader for the purpose of further discussion .
7.1992	`` The finest thing that could possibly have happened .
4.5199	We had our frolic ; and see what it hatched .
15.1447	After this Peleg Growdy will never be the same grumpy man he was in the past .
92.3959	No boy need longer hesitate to call out to him on the street ; for Peleg , I take it , has seen a great light , eh , Jack ? ''
6.0048	and Paul slapped his chum heartily on the shoulder as he spoke .
3.9887	`` My idea exactly , '' replied his chum , quickly .
16.8111	`` And do you know it made me feel bad the way he spoke of Mandy and the kids .
25.2519	Some of you fellows may not know that he lost his wife and children in a fire that burned his house down while he was away .
29.4697	I 'm glad we did that job , and you deserve the praise , Paul , because it was your own scheme . ''
11.4647	`` Humbug !
39.8416	every one of you chimed in as soon as it was mentioned , and so you 're entitled to as much praise as I am .
20.0482	But about those uniforms , boys -- had n't the scout tailor better get to work , going over his measurements again ?
2.6037	We want the suits to fit all right , you know . ''
288.2836	And in this way did Paul direct the attention of his comrades in another quarter , because it was really unpleasant for him to be placed on a pedestal , as though he were different from the rest of them .
7.3267	Amid much laughter and joking the measuring went on .
79.0452	Wallace Carberry wielded the tape-line , and Bobolink put down the figures , being closely patched so that no errors could possibly creep in .
17.0241	So engrossed were they in this interesting business , that no one paid the least attention to their surroundings .
34.8617	And when a heavy shutter was slowly closed over the one large window of the tobacco barn , the fact went unnoticed .
76.2403	In fact the meeting was about ready to disband , and one of the boys started for the door to be in advance of his friends , when he made a discovery .
7.2582	`` Who locked this door , fellows ? ''
2.9204	he called , as he tried in vain to budge the barrier .
10.6722	Of course this drew the attention of all the rest , and a rush was made for the place of exit .
47.7737	One by one the boys tried to push the door open , but even the stoutest of them failed to accomplish it .
12.4595	`` Who was the last one in ? ''
15.7659	demanded Bobolink , furiously , as he retired , worsted from the encounter , to allow another a chance at the door .
8.8026	`` Old Peleg Growdy , to be sure ; and the door was n't fastened then .
2.8238	D'ye suppose he did anything to it when he went out ? ''
75.0633	asked William , as he tried to assist Jud , now straining and pushing in a useless endeavor to move the heavy door .
136.2454	`` That 's nonsense , '' said Paul , as he pointed to the fact that the door could not be locked , since it gave an inch or so each time the boys pushed .
11.2420	`` Ginger !
1.4858	it 's got something braced against it outside , that 's what ! ''
10.4275	announced another fellow .
5.1129	`` As sure as you 're born it has ! ''
12.2718	echoed Bobolink .
18.8372	All doubt was dissipated just then , for a series of loud and derisive shouts in boyish treble welled up from outside .
14.5716	`` Shucks ! ''
26.1923	grunted Bobolink , in sheer disgust ; `` we 've gone and let the Slavin fellers have another crack at us .
14.4481	A nice lot of scouts we look like , not to keep sentries on duty when we have a secret meeting .
3.5987	And now they 've got us cooped up here like a lot of old hens !
16.9557	Shucks !
9.0627	I say again ! ''
3.7636	`` Well , that 's no reason we have to stay cooped up , is it ? ''
82.4114	demanded Jack , as he turned to hunt around for some object which could be used for a battering ram so as to force the barricaded door of the barn .
10.7737	`` T-t-try the b-b-big wagon doors , fellows ! ''
12.2061	whooped Bluff .
7.0115	They did , but with no more success than had attended their puny efforts against the smaller exit .
18.5846	Those who had been at work while they talked must have done a good job , for the big doors were utterly immovable .
7.3111	`` Do we have to stay in here until morning ? ''
24.6441	wailed Andy Flinn , in mock despair .
8.0174	`` Not much , if I have to climb up to the roof , and knock a plank off .
39.0294	Say , those fellows must have been spying out here when I met them this morning , '' said Bobolink .
10.1059	`` Listen now , what d'ye suppose they 're doing ? ''
11.1066	demanded Nuthin ' .
79.0527	All remained in an attitude of expectancy , and could hear strange sounds that seemed to come from under the boards forming the floor of the barn ; which building had not always been used for drying tobacco alone .
4.2170	`` Now what d'ye suppose the sillies are poking poles under there , for ? ''
41.5740	ejaculated William ; `` and just when I was going to propose that we pull up a board , and crawl through the hole . ''
16.1642	`` Whew !
9.6133	what 's this mean ?
28.1182	Say , fellows , if that do n't make me think of a blessed old skunk I do n't know the odor when I meet it ! ''
68.0763	and Wallace drew back as he was about to get down on his hands and knees to investigate the meaning of the odd sounds under the barn flooring .
23.6747	Others got it quickly , and various cries arose , as the boys began to hold their noses , and look around at each other .
2.3720	`` It 'll smother us , fellows , that 's what ! ''
122.1282	gasped William , quite pale by now ; for the odor which a skunk leaves in its wake affects some persons powerfully , though others hardly mind it at all .
8.1273	`` I know ! ''
25.4491	Bluff managed to gasp , with a great effort ; `` there 's a f-f-family of s-s-skunks have their h-h-home under here .
8.1126	I 've seen 'em , b-b-but I never b-b-bothered the b-b-beauties .
9.9755	Oh !
13.2724	ai n't it j-j-just awful , f-f-fellows ? ''
9.7918	It certainly was .
550.6485	Stirred up by the poles wielded by Ted Slavin and his cronies , who must have discovered the presence of the polecats when visiting the barn that morning , and laid their plans accordingly , the little animals were using the only means of defence against an enemy granted them by Nature .
87.2587	William actually keeled over , and his brother had to drag him to the further end of the barn so that he might not get the full benefit of the overpowering scent .
10.4018	`` Something 's just _ got _ to be done ! ''
6.3662	cried Jack , himself not feeling any too well under the infliction .
4.2125	`` Here , help me lift this old beam , boys .
3.5068	We can make a battering ram out of it , and burst a board off somehow .
4.4531	Never mind the damages ; they can be repaired easy enough .
20.2371	Two more get hold .
16.4174	Now , swing around this way .
6.2315	I think the weakest place is in the rear .
7.2113	Keep back , the rest of you .
10.2662	Here goes ! ''
10.6016	Five others had been only too willing to lend a hand when Paul called for volunteers .
62.4514	The beam that had been lying against the further wall was good and heavy ; but that made it all the better as an engine for ramming a hole through the boarded side of the barn .
13.6281	Amid the cheers of the scouts the novel battering ram was carried forward with a will , and on the run .
17.7917	Some of the boys held up lanterns so that those who were in the line of attack could see just where to strike .
12.0420	Even poor overcome William managed to raise his head , and feebly wave a hand of encouragement .
30.4558	The beam struck with tremendous force , and nothing in the way of a plain ordinary boarding could withstand the impetus with which it was driven forward .
9.9259	`` Whoop ! ''
19.3019	yelled the scouts , as a big aperture appeared in the side of the barn , and the route to liberty lay before them .
21.8381	They were not slow to avail themselves of the privilege either , but hastened to scramble through the gap , carrying the lanterns with them .
78.5212	William managed to get up enough steam to crawl outside , where he could breath air that was not fetid , and filled with overpowering odors .
2.1253	Only Bluff looked back half regretfully at the haven of refuge they had just quitted .
83.2144	For he was wondering how his father could ever manage to efface that scent so that the tobacco , soon to be harvested , might be hung up in that barn without detracting from its marketable value .
179.9328	And once out of the trap the Boy Scouts began to chase around , with vengeance in their eyes ; but as on previous occasions the wary enemy , after accomplishing their mischief , had been wise enough to slink away .
26.4836	`` How far do we have to go in this new plan of forgiving the enemy , Paul ? ''
68.9296	asked William , who had by now fully recovered from his recent weakness , and was burning with zeal to avenge himself upon their persecutors .
2.2806	`` Yes , this thing has got to have a limit ! ''
140.3125	declared Jud Elderkin , as he glared around at the moonlit scene , and no doubt imagined their rivals hiding near by , where they could laugh at the disturbed group .
0.5408	Paul knew boy nature too well to stretch their patience beyond the breaking point .
41.3632	He was astonished that such fire-eaters as Bluff , William , and several more , could restrain themselves even as well as they had .
27.6594	To keep them in hand the reins must be loosened a little ; but only to enable him to get a better hold later on .
43.6268	`` Well , there 's no positive rule , fellows ; and so far as I can see I believe the limit has already been passed , with us , '' he said , pleasantly .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
6.9136	that 's the kind of talk ! ''
11.2171	cried the inflammable Twin .
62.4514	`` Then you give us permission to pitch in , and whale the whole bunch the next time they play one of their measly old tricks on us ?
16.8482	Is that so , Paul ? ''
20.7468	demanded Jud .
9.2169	`` Oh !
12.7491	I only h-h-hope so ! ''
10.7033	came from Bluff .
7.1714	`` Wait till the time comes , and perhaps I 'll help you give them a much-needed lesson .
92.2527	We do n't want to play the worm part , always , '' remarked Paul ; `` and now , boys , let 's head for home . ''
335.2462	`` Ta-ta , sweet little meeting-house on the edge of the woods ; I 'll carry fond memories of you as long as this suit of clothes lasts , I guess , '' said William , waving his hand mockingly backward toward the deserted barn .
4.8387	`` Watch out for some of those Slavin fellows on the road .
4.7937	They may bombard us from the woods with rocks ! ''
28.9799	warned Joe Clausin .
5.2488	`` Just let 'em try , that 's all .
86.8700	We 'll chase the stone thrower to a standstill , and then he 'll be sorry he wandered away from his happy home this night ! ''
11.3715	Bobolink declared , ferociously .
38.6064	So they walked along in detached groups , many eyes were on the alert , and listening ears bent to catch some sign of a lurking foe .
630.9396	Once or twice they heard signals being exchanged deep in the woods , evidently by the scattered cohorts of Ted ; but while valiant , the members of the Fox Patrols were wise and prudent as well , copying the cautious attributes of the wary animal after which their new organization had been named .
106.9627	They declined to explore the dense forest , seeking a foe that might only be bent on luring them along , until ready to pounce on them in a body , to make them prisoners of war .
289.2592	And so finally the march came to an end , with all hands satisfied that the last meeting of the little host of new scouts had been attended by several of the most exciting circumstances that ever befell the boys of Stanhope .
20.3316	Paul and his chum walked on together , until reaching the first home they said good night .
19.8588	But neither again brought up that subject which had been worrying Jack Stormways for so long a time .
45.9449	If Paul had conceived any sort of an idea in connection with the strange disappearance of the old coins , he kept it to himself .
259.4352	Once , however , on the way home after leaving Jack , he stopped to clap his hand down vigorously on his knee , and whispered to himself : `` Now , I wonder if that could possibly be so ? ''
869.8210	But no matter what idea had struck him , further words did n't come to tell whether his thoughts were connected with Jack 's personal trouble ; or on the other hand if the annoying enmity of Ted Slavin , Ward Kenwood , and their would-be scout troop , was still on his mind .
914.8170	Nevertheless , as Paul passed up to the front door of his home , and stopped a minute to look up at the bright moon sailing across the eastern heavens , he considered that he had good reason to feel more than satisfied with the magnificent results already attending the new methods of the Boy Scouts .
151.3403	On the following day he sent off the letter containing a check which his father gave him in place of the money , so that it might not be lost .
617.5714	Then followed a period of anxious waiting , during which many of the members of the Stanhope Troop No. 1 felt touches of envy at sight of their rivals parading the streets , decked out in the full regalia of Scouts , and carrying themselves with the proudest of airs .
79.6087	They knew that Ted and Ward were busily engaged in drilling their followers in many of the devices prominently mentioned in the manual book .
328.0415	For that matter , though , it did not require regulation suits of khaki to excel in those same things ; and so the Foxes also studied and experimented , and burned candles at night in the endeavor to learn all that was possible of those various accomplishments .
3.6319	There was a great difference in the boys of the town .
338.8960	Few who were of the proper age but who belonged to one or the other of the troops ; and people were beginning to notice how much more manly they carried themselves , and how anxious they seemed now to get credit marks at home .
9.9161	Parents upon meeting never failed to talk about this wonderful change , and express hopes that it would last .
59.5121	`` The best thing that ever happened , barring none , I think , '' was what the old minister declared , at a meeting of the Women 's Club ; `` and it deserves to be encouraged .
34.2978	Why , you ladies should take advantage of this wave of reform , to get these lads interested in keeping the streets of the town clean .
39.5391	Give me fifty willing workers among the boys , and I warrant you there will never be a stray piece of paper blowing around .
0.2089	They 'll provide receptacles for trash , and see that everybody uses them . ''
1.7033	And so it went around , and everybody seemed delighted at the innovation .
153.1067	Only a few skeptical old fogies shook their heads , and declared that it was too good to last , and that they about expected to see the boys of Stanhope transplanted to the heavens in a body presently , since their wings must be sprouting .
859.6347	About this time it came to the ears of Paul that the banner which the peace-loving Quaker , Mr. Westervelt , had offered for the most proficient troop of scouts along the Bushkill , had been placed on exhibition in the window of a jewelry store over in the manufacturing town of Manchester .
6.4202	He and Jack wheeled over that very day to inspect the coveted trophy .
1.7353	When they saw what a beauty it was , their hearts thrilled with new aspirations .
10.4170	`` Worth fighting hard for , eh , Paul ? ''
20.5161	observed Jack .
136.4412	`` I should say , yes , '' replied the other , delight written in big letters on his face , pressed so close to the glass ; `` and I reckon it would do our fellows lots of good just to run down here to look at that dandy banner .
2.3163	I must tell them all about it , and have them see it for themselves . ''
9.8099	`` A bully good idea .
25.8920	You know how to get a fellow to put his best licks into any job he undertakes , '' declared his chum , admiringly .
10.3246	`` Humbug ! ''
8.1563	scornfully replied Paul ; `` why , it 's as easy as falling off a log .
25.4757	Do n't you feel more like straining every nerve in the effort to win that prize , after seeing how handsome it is ?
3.4173	Well , I just try to believe every fellow is more or less like I am .
8.8143	That 's the whole secret .
0.3972	Yes , Stanhope must work hard to catch up with the other fellows . ''
103.4019	There were several boys standing around , also gaping at the fine snowy banner , upon which as the card under it , went on to state , was to be embroidered with colored silk the totem of the leading patrol of the successful troop .
105.7430	These fellows could not help knowing who the strangers in town were ; and it was also easy for them to guess what had brought Paul and Jack down there .
19.1714	More than a few times had they seen these Stanhope boys competing on the athletic field , either in baseball , or football .
14.4639	And of course it was always good form for Manchester lads to `` josh '' any would-be rivals .
54.5687	`` Yes , '' said one of the natives , with a grin , `` up in that corner is where the eagle is going to be painted .
10.0632	And every time we go on a hike we 'll carry that banner at the head of the procession . ''
101.3536	`` They say , '' remarked another , with pretended innocence , `` that poor old Stanhope is getting up a troop , and even hopes to have a try for this beauty .
0.3675	Now , what do you think about the nerve of that , fellows ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
372.4647	well , the more the merrier , '' came from a third , whom Paul knew to be the scout leader of the `` Eagles '' in person , `` and after all , we do n't mind showing these tenderfeet scouts how to do stunts .
6.1329	None of us want to be hogs , boys .
4.7008	There 's room enough for all , even if some do have to eat the husks . ''
14.7781	Paul had to laugh out loud at this .
14.6088	`` Say , you 're on to us , all right , Manchester , '' he said , turning around .
4.9956	`` Yes , we 've come down here just to take a peep at this great prize .
14.9671	Of course we 'd like mighty well to say we meant to win it ; but we 're too modest for that .
0.1992	The most we admit is that we mean to make a try for it .
146.7440	Of course we have n't got much show against two such veteran troops as Manchester and Aldine ; but we want to get all the fun out of the game we can .
9.0015	And you wo n't begrudge us that , Claypool ? ''
72.4840	`` Sure we wo n't , Morrison , '' returned the other , frankly , thrusting out his hand ; `` as I said before , the more in it the better .
7.1912	It will make our victory look bigger . ''
160.2690	`` Glad to see you 're so dead sure of winning out , '' laughed Paul ; `` whenever the Stanhope boys go into anything they always work harder if they have big odds against them .
183.6027	But all the same that 's a bully good banner , and no matter whether it has an eagle , the head of a beaver , or that of a fox worked on it in colored silk , it 's going to be something we 'll all be proud of as Boy Scouts . ''
387.4475	`` That 's well put , Morrison ; though you might just as well get it out of your head now as later that the Manchester fellows will ever let any crowd come in here and take that dandy flag away .
22.3001	Why , our fellows know ten times as much about scout tactics as your greenhorns do now . ''
23.0654	Claypole did not mean to be overbearing ; when he said this he really believed it to be an actual fact .
1848.1046	`` That 's very true , '' said Paul , quietly , as he and his chum prepared to mount their wheels for the return journey ; `` but Thanksgiving is still more than two months off ; and Claypole , I give you my word , we 've got some of the smartest tenderfeet in the Stanhope troop you ever heard of .
14.0281	Ta-ta , boys ! ''
92.5357	Of course , when Paul and Jack told what they had seen , every fellow wanted to make the run over to Manchester to look for himself .
96.3050	And , just as Paul had expected , they came back home more than ever enthused with the hope and prospect of winning that royal banner for the Stanhope troop .
144.3569	At the next meeting the talk was all about the prize , and a vote was even taken to ascertain to whom the honor of being the banner bearer might fall , in case the victory was awarded to Stanhope .
15.0715	Wallace Carberry turned out to be the lucky standard bearer .
12.0076	All of which was just what clever Paul wanted .
2.9021	He had infused a new stimulant into the veins of his comrades .
799.8803	And at their next outdoor rally , when various contests were undertaken to discover who showed the most skill , he found that the very atmosphere seemed to be surcharged with electricity ; for the boys labored to excel as they had never done before ; but it was because each one believed that upon his shoulders alone devolved the duty of bringing that beautiful prize to Stanhope .
28.5000	Four days later the expected suits arrived , much sooner than even the most sanguine had anticipated .
23.9953	Then there _ was _ a time .
94.9233	The usually quiet and peaceful streets of the town were fairly filled with khaki-clad warriors , strutting up and down , exchanging military salutes , and arousing the admiration of all the girls , who came forth to gaze and applaud .
14.7389	It was a great day for Stanhope .
121.6115	A stranger visiting there for the first time might think some military academy must have taken up fall quarters near by , and granted full liberty to its uniformed hosts .
58.6571	If there were those who had been hesitating about joining either of the troops , a decision must certainly follow the first glimpse of those gallant uniforms .
84.4204	That night many a lad ate supper as an honored guest at his father 's table ; for surely the wearer of a uniform must be entitled to unusual privileges .
3.4105	Of course the word had gone around for a meeting of the Stanhope No. 1 .
2.5497	But it was not to be held at the Shipley barn -- oh !
278.6519	no , those boys had had `` quite a sufficiency , '' as Bobolink said , of their former quarters ; and Bluff admitted that his father would not dare use the building again that year for his tobacco crop .
355.6953	Jason Carberry , father of the twins , had asked as a favor that they make use of his big smithy ; and since the night air was cool , Paul had accepted this generous proposition of the blacksmith on the spot .
0.2176	So that was where they came together , a uniformed organization , at last .
8.2398	`` Man the bellows , somebody . ''
4.7548	`` Yes , stir up the fire in that forge , William .
3.8118	It 's the coldest September night on record , and that 's a fact ! ''
201.1254	exclaimed Bobolink , as he pushed the lively member of the Carberry team toward the smouldering fire left by the blacksmith when he gave over his capacious smithy to the Boy Scouts for their meeting .
8.8218	`` M-m-my dad s-s-says he once lost his t-t-t-tobacco c-crop in S-s-september ! ''
6.1256	observed Bluff , shaking his head as he pushed toward the fire .
7.7197	The boys had had a fine meeting .
727.0327	Besides the twenty-two in their new uniforms , four new recruits had been present , to drink in with eager ears all that passed , and sigh for the day to come when they too might shine forth in such resplendant suits .
6.3823	Already was there much rivalry shown in the many competitions which the young scout leaders had instituted .
252.4179	There was a class on aviation , another that had taken up the mysteries of camping with all its fascinating details ; a third chose photography as the most entrancing subject , and exhibited many pictures that were to be entered in the great contest of the county for the banner .
80.9541	Then several boys had doubled , for surely the knowledge of cookery went hand in hand with that of camping ; while a good stalker could at the same time enter for a merit badge in the path-finding line .
40.1286	Besides , though the season was late for swimming , several fellows who knew just what their best accomplishment might be , had qualified to enter this class .
7.5799	On the whole the meeting had been a most interesting one .
287.9939	Every scout was burning with enthusiasm , and many were the resolutions that Stanhope must have what Bobolink called a `` show-in , '' with regard to that coveted banner , which was to fall to the leading patrol of the county .
60.8311	They were now almost ready to `` break camp '' for the evening , and before doing so indulged in a little general talk .
13.6234	Many had ideas which they wished to advance , in order to discover what the attitude of their comrades might be .
211.6010	`` Mr. Chairman , '' said Wallace Carberry , when he found a little lull in the buzz of conversation , `` I have a proposition I 'd like to put before the meeting before we disband . ''
10.2032	`` Hear !
10.2032	hear ! ''
65.8010	shouted several of the boys , notably those who had been seen in close confab with Wallace , and hence probably in touch with his scheme .
20.8160	`` All right , Number Seven ; let 's hear what it is , '' replied Paul , readily .
6.2022	Every member of each patrol had a number .
38.8973	These began with the scout leader , who of course had to take the `` initial sack , '' as Bobolink , still baseball wild , put it .
1266.6985	Jack , as his assistant in control , came as Number Two ; Bobolink next ; Bluff captured Four as his distinguishing feature ; Nuthin ' being Five , and the twins the next pair , for it would never do to separate William and Wallace , while Tom Betts was Eighth and last .
255.2996	`` If the gentlemen present will give me the floor , with the privilege of three minutes in which to explain what I have in mind , I will be glad to comply . ''
11.1896	Wallace was very precise in his way of putting things .
18.4269	This did not happen only when in school , or as he stood up to address a meeting of his chums .
4.0495	He could not unbend his dignity even under the most trivial conditions .
151.0369	William was just the reverse ; and so full of frolic and fun that the boys always declared the pair to be unequally matched , since in disposition they were exact opposites .
7.0277	And yet under it all there was the same abiding affection that generally may be found between twins .
10.2032	`` Hear !
10.2032	hear ! ''
18.8680	shouted the boys once more .
9.3253	`` Let 's have it , Wallace , old sport .
8.0379	It 's bound to be a jim-dandy idea ! ''
185.6508	declared a loud voice that seemed to spring from the ceiling ; but no one was deceived , for they knew only too well how Bobolink could throw his voice pretty much where he pleased .
10.0311	`` Silence ! ''
274.3623	When Paul , who in the absence of a regular scout master , occupied the chair , uttered this one word every sound ceased ; and after that there was no excuse for Wallace to hesitate longer .
110.5792	`` Some of us have been talking it over , Mr. Chairman , and we would respectfully request that you name an early date when we can go out into the woods for several tests of skill .
12.6689	There is much keen rivalry among a number of us already , which can only be settled by an open trial .
12.7772	First of all there is the interesting water-boiling test of woodmanship .
36.1998	We want to know who is the leading light in that class so we may push him forward to enter the general competition with other Boy Scout troops .
15.7885	Am I understood , Mr. Chairman ? ''
103.0767	`` I think you have made your meaning plain , and the one particular competition you mention happens to be the most interesting of all , '' replied Paul .
19.1124	`` Then may we hope that you will name an early day for the trial to come off ?
142.2839	Unfortunately school begins shortly now , and outside of Saturdays and holidays the several Fox patrols may not have much chance to practice before the grand trial comes off .
9.6547	Make it as early as possible , Mr. Chairman . ''
12.9480	`` How would to-morrow do ? ''
21.6302	asked Paul , only too anxious himself to ascertain how the boys would `` toe the mark . ''
23.7274	Wallace looked at his backers , and there were vigorous nods in answer to the question seen upon his face .
24.4232	`` It seems to be the unanimous consensus of opinion , Mr. Chairman , that to-morrow would suit first rate .
44.2660	Please give us the hour for assembling , and you can depend on our being on deck , '' Wallace remarked .
24.1306	`` Two o'clock ought to answer .
8.6720	That will give us plenty of time to try out a lot of stunts I shall arrange for . ''
8.9572	`` Where shall we meet ? ''
28.3784	asked Jud Elderkin .
12.6318	`` H-h-how about our b-b-barn , fellows ? ''
11.4061	queried Bluff , grinning .
21.8528	There was an instantaneous howl of derision , and every right hand went up so that the thumb and forefinger might compress a nose .
18.8188	`` Another year might do , Bluff ! ''
19.4988	called one .
12.2906	`` What is n't fit for storing tobacco ca n't be a proper meeting place for respectable Boy Scouts ! ''
9.7956	declared another , energetically .
9.2169	`` Oh !
3.0167	he 's only bluffing , fellows ; do n't mind him ! ''
0.3961	`` In fancy I can smell it now , '' sang another , mockingly .
324.0730	`` We 'll meet just outside this very blacksmith shop , and at two sharp , '' declared the chairman , decisively ; `` and any scout who is tardy will be given one or more bad marks that he must carry as a load in the competition .
3.5918	Punctuality is a leading trait in Stanhope Troop No. 1 , you understand .
9.5580	Any other proposition ? ''
25.2224	The boys began to talk among themselves , and for a short time there was a constant buzz that sounded like a big hive of bees .
7.5425	Jack found himself in contact with Paul while this was going on .
85.1341	He had been doing his duty to the best of his ability as he understood it ; and while the meeting was in progress had proven conclusively that he had a thorough knowledge of the many things a full fledged scout must know .
4.7592	Jack meant to graduate from the tenderfoot class in the shortest possible space of time .
3.7673	Any scout may do this by being diligent in the pursuit of various lines of woodcraft .
38.1075	`` Well , '' said Jack , as he pushed alongside his chum , `` this has been a dandy meeting , all right .
87.2964	And there are four new fellows knocking at the door ; with perhaps more to follow , when Stanhope learns what great times we have . ''
1.6117	`` Yes , and I guess we 'll need new recruits right along .
155.5700	You know that some of the boys will fall by the wayside soon after the novelty has worn off , '' remarked wise Paul , who delighted in studying human nature as he saw it around him .
10.3587	`` Listen !
11.4762	fellows !
10.0141	The fire alarm ! ''
22.3351	shouted Joe Clausin , just at that instant .
9.9507	Every voice was hushed .
205.4367	Clear upon the night air rang out the sound of a tocsin -- the stroke of a hammer upon a steel rim from a locomotive wheel , and which was hung aloft in the only firehouse in Stanhope .
60.7743	It was a thrilling sound at any time , and especially to a company of boys newly enlisted in the great cause of humanity -- of lending a hand to neighbors who might be in trouble .
178.5726	So after several more clear , resounding strokes had pealed forth , calling the volunteer department out to fight the fire demon , one scout started wildly for the double doors of the smithy .
50.1757	He was immediately followed by others , and in almost the twinkling of an eye the Carberry blacksmith shop was emptied of its late noisy crowd .
9.2169	`` Wow !
7.2143	look at that , will you ? ''
6.4959	`` It 's a barn most likely ! ''
7.6012	`` Do n't you believe it .
6.3401	I can see the roof of the house !
7.6497	Say , I believe it must be that old Bradley place !
8.3815	Come along , fellows ! ''
6.2770	`` There are the firemen on the run !
4.2357	They 'll have old Rescue No. 1 on the jump in a jiffy .
4.8457	Hey , fellers , let 's get busy , and pull the hose cart for 'em ! ''
10.8842	`` Bully idea .
17.7855	Lead the way , Paul !
4.2829	It 's up to you to show us how ! ''
49.7569	With these and many more cries the Boy Scouts bore down on the building that sheltered the lone fire department of the town .
127.3114	This consisted of a cast-off engine in good repair which had been purchased from some big city , where they were installing an auto in place of horse power for propelling their machines ; and a hose reel , the latter to be drawn by a line of men .
1.8314	Of course the assembling firemen were only too glad of the offered aid .
61.1835	To have a score of husky boys appear so readily on the scene , ready for business , was in the line of a `` snap . ''
71.9036	Accordingly , while some of the men got the horses hitched to the engine , and others started the fire going , the hose cart was rushed out , and its long rope eagerly seized by the waiting boys .
56.2017	Paul was at the end of the line , for a scout leader must live up to his reputation as a general , no matter what the emergency .
9.4549	`` Pull ! ''
32.1340	went forth the cry , and immediately the hose reel started off in the direction where a flash of fiery red announced that the excitement was centred .
12.0994	Nothing could please such an energetic lot of lads more than a chance to make themselves useful in this way .
12.7147	They pulled with a will , and passed along the road leading out of the town , on a wild run .
60.0171	The one who had declared that it was the old Bradley house that was on fire must have had the situation well in mind .
8.2010	Perhaps he lived in that neighborhood , and was better able to judge than the balance of the boys .
0.3663	At any rate all of them had by now made sure of the fact .
56.8788	Paul remembered that a family , in which were quite a number of children , had lately come to town , and taken the big ramshackle building .
21.4281	The thought gave him a thrill , and inwardly he found himself hoping that none of them might be caught in that fire-trap .
6.9998	`` There comes the old machine ! ''
57.7548	shouted the fellow who , not being able to get a grip on the rope by which the hose wagon was drawn , trotted in the rear , and made out to push .
31.0966	Yes , they could hear the shouts of the excited fire laddies now , and also catch the sound of galloping horses .
22.8484	Looking over his shoulder , Paul saw a medley of moving lights , evidently the lanterns carried by the volunteers .
64.3600	These were doubtless clad in their old toggery and fire hats , the foreman with his silver trumpet in evidence , without which no respectable fire would think of allowing itself to be quenched .
62.9384	And a rising column of sparks attested to the fact that the fire in the engine was in full blast , so that steam would be ready by the time the scene of operations was reached .
8.9725	`` One side , boys , and let them pass !
8.3248	Give them plenty of room ! ''
19.6939	called Paul .
486.0240	He had seen that old engine booming along to a fire on many an occasion , and remembered that the driver , Hank Seeris , was inclined to be a reckless hand ; for as a rule the machine was wobbling from side to side , and threatening to overturn at any minute .
144.2204	Up to this date that catastrophe had never happened ; but Paul remembered the old saying that `` a pitcher may go to the well once too often ; '' and he had fears .
45.6957	It proved that they were well grounded too , after the hose reed had safely negotiated the last bend in the road , and the burning dwelling was in plain sight .
7.1084	`` Look at them coming , full tilt !
6.4363	They will be over at the turn ! ''
18.0003	shrieked Bobolink , who , being near the tail end of the double line could observe what was taking place without hindrance .
3.0996	Immediately there arose a chorus of loud shouts , as of warning .
90.7068	But apparently Hank Seeris must have been indulging in more liquor than was good for him ; or else he happened to be in an unusually reckless state .
7.1251	`` They 're going over ! ''
12.5379	howled Bobolink .
9.6168	`` Smash ! ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
5.4222	there goes our only engine to the scrap heap ! ''
123.5204	exclaimed Jud Elderkin , in dismay ; for his father happened to be the foreman , and it looked just then as though the gallant fireman might be without a job .
15.7837	Paul ran back , as did most of the boys , thinking that something terrible must have happened .
20.6459	The plunging horses had been pulled down , and a man was already sitting on the head of each to keep them from kicking further .
23.1082	There are generally some wise persons present in such a calamity , who know just what ought to be done .
24.0574	Willing hands were already unhitching the horses , so that they could be taken out of the way , and the ditched engine upraised .
13.3784	`` Where 's Hank , the driver !
9.6527	Is he hurt ? ''
305.4364	asked some one ; and Paul recognized the old minister , who must have been on the way home from visiting when the alarm burst out , and hence he had accompanied the fire fighters , eager to lend a hand at the rescue work .
1.6297	`` Here he is , and just comin ' to , after being knocked senseless .
14.4157	Hank ai n't hurted , I reckon , '' answered a citizen who had run with the machine .
4.6999	`` How about the engine -- is she much damaged ? ''
0.5142	asked the foreman , as men set about raising the heavy Rescue No. 1 .
11.5803	`` Out of business for this trip , Elderkin .
13.1092	She 'll never work again till she 's gone down to the city for repairs , '' came the answer .
9.6348	A groan of dismay went up .
54.5101	`` That settles the fate of the old Bradley house , then , '' declared many , as they saw the flames and smoke apparently increasing .
220.2865	Everybody was now anxious to get on the scene , and the engine was left in charge of a watcher , while the crowd rushed along , exchanging views of the accident , and the chances of saving the building by means of a bucket brigade .
1.5879	The foreman proved himself to be the right man in the right place .
22.9230	He instantly organized a double line of men and boys , leading from the creek near by , up to the house that was burning .
3.3389	Every imaginable species of bucket and tin pail was pressed into use .
9.1770	Men and boys invaded the kitchen and captured all sorts of utensils , from milkpans to butter firkins .
24.9403	These were put into use , and passed along as rapidly as those at the creek end could plunge them in , and fill them with water .
20.8922	At the other terminus the foreman and his assistants took the water pails , and dashed the contents here and there as opportunity arose .
0.2745	The Boy Scouts were nearly all somewhere in the line , and working valorously .
43.3783	For the time being they utterly forgot they were dressed in their new suits of khaki , and that the pails slopped over continuously , soon soaking them to the skin .
4.2013	Cheered on by the appeals of their leader they never flinched .
67.3295	It was the first chance Paul had of seeing how his enlisted followers could forget self , and rise grandly to an occasion .
24.4549	When any one showed signs of tiring he was quickly crowded out of the line by another eager willing worker .
82.9966	Indeed , there seemed to be three applicants for each job ; and had there been more buckets several lines might have been formed to make use of that accommodating creek .
52.4128	Jack , after a little , found himself pushed aside by another scout , who wanted to exercise his muscles , and could wait no longer .
21.0002	Seeing a group around some children , and hearing sudden cries from a woman , Jack hurried across the lawn .
63.3568	Somehow he seemed to fear that new trouble had broken out ; and when he saw a half-clad figure wringing her hands , and shrieking , he realized that his suspicions were going to prove true .
7.4882	`` What is it ? ''
2.6454	he asked , of another scout , coming away from the group .
9.6722	`` Her baby .
5.8336	She says it is in the house ! ''
0.2157	replied the boy , whose face was white with the horror of it all .
8.4583	`` What ? ''
5.8572	cried Jack ; `` did she forget her own baby , then ? ''
6.8650	`` She thought her husband had it .
8.4175	He 's a sick man too .
4.6325	See , that 's him they are holding back there .
1.4622	He wants to go in for the baby , and they wo n't let him .
9.9755	Oh !
2.7573	Jack , I 'd like to do it , but I 'm afraid of fire .
14.2830	I just dassent ! ''
10.7993	sobbed the boy .
16.6561	Jack waited to hear no more .
3.1631	His blood seemed to be on fire , and his teeth came together with a click .
25.1059	Another moment and he was in the group , eagerly plying the almost distracted mother with questions as to which room her baby had been in .
99.5384	Fortunately Jack had once known a boy living in the old Bradley mansion ; so that the interior of the house was not strange to him .
2.8417	`` Our bedroom -- it is the corner one where the tower stands .
14.1017	The one that has the alcove ! ''
30.4219	the lady managed to cry , as she caught his arm , and looked , oh , so pleadingly , in his boyish , determined face .
11.9266	After that Jack would have risked anything in the attempt to save that innocent little one .
7.7364	He rushed off without saying a word .
90.7494	Several put out a hand to stop him , under the belief that it was useless , since that portion of the building seemed to be a mass of flames by now .
10.4947	But Jack dodged them just as he did when running with the ball on the football field .
99.9916	When he dashed into the house , disappearing in the volume of smoke that poured from the open doorway , a groan went up from the great crowd ; for they doubted as to whether he would ever be seen alive again .
7.5156	`` He 's gone ! ''
7.7700	`` Who was that boy ? ''
7.4243	called the foreman of the fire company , as he came running up , waving his speaking trumpet .
14.0271	`` Jack Stormways , the lumber man 's boy ! ''
18.9891	some one answered .
15.1907	`` Well , he 's a good one , all right ; but I 'm sorry for his mother ! ''
25.6505	said the experienced fire-fighter , as he looked anxiously at the flames pouring out from several windows directly under the room next the tower .
14.8184	Paul had dropped out of the line .
10.9990	He could not pass another bucket after seeing the chum he loved so well plunge into the doomed building .
79.3505	From right and left he heard many things spoken , and presently understood what it was induced Jack to attempt what seemed so like a foolhardy thing .
38.8646	So it would have been , had the object of Jack 's attempt been the securing of valuables , no matter what the amount .
53.0411	But a human life counts for more than earthly riches ; and a brave soul never stops to consider the risk when a fellow being is in peril of a terrible fate .
13.5657	Jack found himself in the midst of dense smoke as soon as he plunged across the doorsill .
17.2877	He had foreseen this , and with a wisdom beyond his years made simple preparations to combat the evil .
174.2516	On the way to the door he passed close by one who carried a bucket of water , and some happy inspiration caused him to snatch out his handkerchief and dip it into the cool liquid , not wringing it out to any extent .
34.0710	This he clapped over his nose , so that in breathing the wet cloth would keep much of the suffocating vapor from being drawn into his lungs .
9.5012	His eyes began to smart furiously .
136.9020	By the time he was half way up the stairs he could not see a thing around him save murky clouds of smoke , lighted by the tongues of flame that darted like serpents out of many places .
3.9105	He staggered up still further , and fell on the landing .
1.8548	But gaining his feet again he pushed on , still heading in the right direction .
31.0285	Only for the knowledge he possessed regarding the interior of the building , Jack would have lost his bearings then and there .
8.0244	The result must have been serious indeed .
9.0076	Along the hall he went .
4.9019	It seemed to grow hotter the further he pushed ; but even that did not daunt him .
6.6195	Once enlisted in a good cause he must go on , no matter what faced him .
45.2656	Had not Paul said words to that effect , after telling them what it meant to be a tried and true scout ?
18.5421	And here the opportunity had come to him not half an hour after the thrilling words were spoken !
172.5833	Those outside while still sending the buckets of water along , in the effort to save one portion of the large house , were waiting to see what came of Jack 's attempt at rescue .
7.6183	`` He 's lost ! ''
123.0275	declared one , as the fire broke out in a new place ; `` see , that 's the tower burning now , and she said the baby was in the room next there . ''
20.2549	`` Poor old Jack !
5.8679	to think it should be him to go ! ''
7.2160	groaned Bobolink ; `` see , Paul , there 's his father passing the buckets along .
2.8968	He do n't even know his boy is in the old shack !
9.9755	Oh !
3.9512	my , whatever did he take chances like that for ? ''
1.7915	`` Because he could n't stand and see that poor mother shrieking for her baby .
4.7324	Because he 's got the strongest heart of us all !
9.1690	That 's why ! ''
11.3749	declared Paul , his voice vibrating with love for the chum he might never see alive again .
58.6038	And Bobolink said to himself : `` By the jumpin ' Jehosaphat , I believe Paul would have gone if Jack had n't .
27.2890	He 's lookin ' at that house now like he wanted to run right in and tear it to flinders . ''
6.2352	`` There he is at the window ! ''
9.2481	whooped a man 's heavy voice .
5.5884	Instantly every eye ranged along the front of the building , wherever the columns of smoke permitted .
10.3989	And many a finger was pointed at the one where a waving hat served to draw attention .
8.7833	`` He 's shouting something .
9.2641	Keep still , everybody ! ''
10.5117	A dead silence immediately ensued .
34.1347	Only the roaring and crackling of the hungry flames could be heard , as every ear was strained to catch what it was the imperiled boy was saying .
6.3522	`` He 's got the baby -- look !
6.6890	he 's holding her up ! ''
5.3043	A shriek came from the agonized mother , and she fell on her knees with clasped hands .
6.6904	`` Listen to what he says ! ''
1.6853	`` Go to back of house -- get ladder to window there ! ''
13.1725	called Jack huskily , at the top of his voice .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
9.9993	we understand , old fellow !
5.7824	We 'll have you out of that yet ! ''
1.8799	whooped Bobolink , starting on the run around the end of the mansion .
6.3620	`` A ladder -- bring it around , boys !
8.6936	Let 's save the brave youngster ! ''
11.2776	howled the tall foreman .
46.8221	The ladder happened to be up against the building at a point where the flames had now burst forth , driving the fire-fighters back .
53.9428	Himself , the foreman led in a bold forward rush to capture the required ladder ; nor was he to be denied , scorning the efforts of the licking tongues of fire to daunt him .
1.5736	Then , with a swarm of followers , he pushed around the corner .
42.5823	Here , to be sure , there did seem to be less of smoke and blaze , owing to the direction of the night wind .
15.7596	Now they were placing the ladder .
11.4478	It reached up to a window , and if only Jack would show himself all might be well .
46.8083	Seconds were like an eternity to those who crowded below , every face upturned , and every eye ranging along the side of the house .
7.3852	The fire was pushing in this direction too , for it suddenly burst out of a broken window .
7.4729	From many pairs of lips there burst a groan .
172.4892	Well did they know that every second counted against the boy , who was doubtless groping his way along halls and through rooms filled with that overpowering smoke .
7.3830	`` There he is ! ''
5.2423	It was like a sudden electric shock , that cry .
83.4286	The clarion notes of a bugle would not have thrilled that vast crowd one half so surely as did the appearance of a head at a window on the left .
19.7343	Jack had been shrewd enough to pick out a room that was further away from the devouring flames .
6.7709	A hoarse shout went up at sight of him .
6.2891	`` He 's got the baby too ! ''
132.0864	was the tenor of that victorious cry ; and it was as though every man and boy and other person present felt a personal interest in the success of Jack 's daring venture .
69.4100	The precious baby was saved ; yes , he was hugging the bundle to his breast ; and during a lull in the clamor they plainly heard the lusty cries that proceeded from that shawl-wrapped package .
6.1158	Those were doubtless the most blessed sounds that ever reached the strained ears of the praying mother .
52.0246	Quickly was the ladder lifted and rushed along the wall of the house until it stood beneath the window where Jack had shown himself .
4.0628	The foreman himself mounted as soon as it was in position .
0.6611	But Jack refused to hand over his burden , nor could Mr. Elderkin insist .
60.7771	It was only right that the one who had saved the little darling should have the pleasure of placing her in the arms of the frantic mother .
154.1790	But he could and did guide Jack 's feet as they sought the rounds of the friendly ladder , so that presently the boy , with singed hair , and begrimed with smoke , was lifted to the ground .
176.9153	Hardly had Jack landed than a pair of arms encircled both him and the baby ; for in that happy moment the mother realized what she owed this brave lad ; and her heart was brimming over with gratitude .
9.7018	Such shouts as went up then !
43.9424	Those still coming to the scene must have thought the wearers of the fire hats had succeeded in running a line of hose into a position where victory was assured .
90.3663	Again the bucket brigade got busy , working with renewed zeal , though but little hope of saving any portion of the big building now remained .
5.7497	But every one was roused up to fever pitch by the excitement of the hour .
0.4615	And Jack 's valiant work had helped inspire them to renewed deeds of endeavor .
12.4325	Paul led his chum away , for Jack was almost exhausted .
7.6341	Then came Mr. Stormways on the run , having just learned what his boy had done .
360.1703	He seized Jack in his arms , and shed tears over him ; though at the same time his heart must have swelled within him with satisfaction that one of his brood had acquitted himself so well in a crisis that called for a cool head and nerves of steel .
6.8647	The flames kept on eating into the old building .
25.1767	It was now doomed , and the fire laddies confined their efforts to saving any furniture that could be carried out .
0.3890	Paul called his scouts around him , at the request of the old minister .
10.0313	They were rather a sorry looking group , though just as full of a desire to assist as ever .
5.7246	The fine new uniforms were bedraggled with mud and water .
9.3219	Several had holes burned in their coats , and that of Jack was a sight to behold .
10.0299	But who cared ?
2.8409	After all , the uniforms were but an insignia of their connection with a great organization .
31.8753	New or old they stood for a principle ; and gallantly had Stanhope Troop No. 1 responded when the need arose .
62.1932	The old and highly respected minister , whose heart was filled with a great love for the rising generation , shook hands with each and every scout , declaring that he was proud of the privilege .
3.0186	`` Do n't mind the soiling of your new uniforms , lads .
4.3569	Every mark found upon them to-morrow must serve as a badge of honor to the wearer .
205.0201	After this it will be the tried and true scout who can point to a burnt hole in his smart coat , and say ' I got that the night of the great fire up at Bradley 's ! '
36.3225	And what shall I say of this fine member of your patrol who so bravely risked his own life to save that of a mother 's baby ?
4.4274	Only that his own mother has reason to thank God to-night because of such a son .
7.7679	We all love him ! ''
0.4724	and a tear fell on Jack 's hand as the old man squeezed it .
14.8155	`` All here , Paul ! ''
34.6546	Jack saluted as he said this , and smiled to see the look the scout leader gave his scorched and discolored uniform .
531.6800	Although Jack had spent an hour and more that morning trying to clean up his suit and leggins , they showed many signs of the hard service to which they had been put on the previous night .
9.0260	Several of the fellows carried cameras .
10.7319	They had signed for the photographic test , and hoped to get some fine views of the troop in action .
43.5927	These would possibly be entered for competition when the other commands in the county lined up to strive for leadership in the last great event -- the winning of the banner .
24.2928	Presently the town clock struck the hour .
16.9759	`` Fall in ! ''
19.7227	Two by two they marched out of town .
4.8952	People came to the doors to watch them ; and many a girl waved her handkerchief vigorously .
7.7747	But there was no response .
123.0381	Much as some of the lads might have liked to raise a hat , and send back an answering salute , they had already learned how to keep their eyes to the front , on penalty of being given bad marks that might tell against them later on .
4.0531	More than one parent looked to see how the boy nearest their hearts bore himself .
30.9810	Proudly they watched the long double line swinging down the street , keeping excellent step , considering how little time they had had for drill .
3.9746	Other boys there were who stood on the corners and mocked .
43.1418	Of course these were the followers of Ted Slavin , envious of the popularity already attained by Paul 's patrol .
27.2441	Some of them had been at the fire , and witnessed the deed of daring carried out by Jack Stormways .
5.8120	Jealous of the other troop they tried to taunt them by various cries ; but without success .
0.2194	However , most of them did not venture to tag after the marching corps .
57.2934	They knew that even the wonderful patience of these fellows would have its limit , and that a sudden turn might be made upon the tormentors that could hardly prove pleasant for the minority .
4.2771	Out of the town limits they went , still keeping step .
4.2127	Ted and Ward trailed behind , but there was no more taunting done .
41.4731	`` They mean to follow , and see what we are up to , '' said Jack , when he came alongside the leader again .
0.1817	`` Well , we ca n't stop them from doing that , I suppose .
7.7114	The woods are free to all .
10.4180	Let them look .
3.3379	If they can pick up a few pointers , well and good .
12.0152	When we lead , you know we can afford to laugh at those who follow , '' returned the other .
27.2024	`` Sure , because they 'll never catch up with us in a year , '' laughed Jack .
8.5253	For a full mile they continued , never once breaking ranks .
7.5679	`` We 're nearly there , fellows .
6.0312	You 're doing fine , I tell you .
6.8064	Keep it up through to the end .
7.6744	Why , you march like veterans already ! ''
178.2622	In this fashion did the scout leader warm every heart , and cause those who were beginning to tire of the jaunt to grit their teeth , and resolve that nothing must be allowed to interfere with the completion of the march .
12.3562	`` Left wheel ! ''
9.9480	came the command , as the van drew abreast of an opening where a wagon road entered the woods .
164.8273	Still those two curious ones trailed in the rear , determined to ascertain what it was that took the Fox Patrols out of town this day .
63.9632	Presently , surrounded by the giant trees , still green with their summer foliage , Paul gave the command to halt and break ranks .
19.0236	Immediately the twenty-six lads began fraternizing .
0.2525	Those owning cameras started to look around for openings where some promising view offered .
40.5710	But most of the scouts clustered around the leader , eager to hear what the programme of the day would embrace .
16.1995	`` First comes the fire test .
3.1380	There are a dozen fellows who have come prepared to qualify for that .
6.0895	And I think we shall have an interesting competition .
2.3822	Here , all who have hatchets get busy , and cut wood . ''
79.1766	Paul himself led the way , for he delighted in using the little camp axe which he often `` toted '' into the woods , when hunting or camping .
14.1958	The sound of chopping soon resounded through the timber , and by degrees quite a pile of wood had been accumulated .
62.9598	But all this was simply to loosen up the muscles of the competitors ; for they were not to be allowed to use any of this fuel , which was for the main campfire .
20.0531	Once this had been started , Paul distributed a dozen tin kettles that had been brought along .
6.6530	These were all of the same size .
42.6769	Moreover , they had a plain mark two-thirds of the way up , which was to limit the amount of cold water from the near-brook which they must contain .
12.6894	`` Here are five matches for each one of you .
9.1514	Every fellow is placed on his honor not to have a single other one in his possession .
1.5887	You are not to use any kind of paper in kindling your fires .
3.8106	Just imagine that you are adrift in the wilderness , where a newspaper is never seen .
11.1707	And in the end when a kettle begins to boil the owner of it must shout and raise his hand .
8.4115	I will have inspectors appointed whose duty it will be to see that all is fairly done . ''
7.6678	`` Do n't we get more than these five matches ? ''
17.5157	asked one of the contestants .
7.7812	`` That is all .
130.5681	And remember , that if two are tied when the quart of water boils , the fellow who can show the most _ unused _ matches comes in ahead .
4.9148	That is a valuable point , for it proves that he knows how to conserve his resources .
3.3877	A match is sometimes of priceless value to a man lost in the big timber . ''
6.8847	`` Tell us again what we must do , Paul . ''
9.0745	`` Form a line right here .
6.4418	When I say ` go , ' every fellow dart off to some place he has in mind .
9.0857	With your hatchets you are to chop wood , and get a fire started as quick as you can .
3.5925	Then place your kettle on it , and keep on adding fuel until the water boils .
3.7153	I will time every contestant myself , and keep a record .
7.4967	But this is just a preliminary trial .
8.0760	We 'll have another later on .
9.0391	Ready , all ? ''
8.1701	The twelve contestants lined up , while the others watched operations .
10.3848	Even the two outsiders had kept getting closer , so as to understand all that was done .
29.1027	And as Ward had his gold watch in his hand it was evident that he intended to do a little timing himself .
85.8530	`` He wants to see how our best compares with what some of his fellows will do , '' remarked Jack , to Paul .
9.4853	`` All right .
9.9280	He 's welcome .
10.4481	The more the merrier .
141.3968	If they have any fellow who is more at home in the woods than Wallace Carberry for instance , I 'd just like to know it , '' returned the other , promptly .
17.3194	`` How about you , Paul ?
85.0606	I guess Wallace would stand a mighty poor show if he ran a race with the head scout , '' returned the second in command .
6.1927	`` That 's something we 've never settled yet .
11.1262	Wallace and I must have a chance at each other some day ; but not yet .
18.5170	Now watch them scurry around .
1.7989	Every fellow has his mind made up where he can cut wood easiest .
11.8998	I 've made them bring in all loose stuff , you see , so that they start on an even thing .
10.2662	Here goes ! ''
6.8934	Paul raised his hand , and exclaimed : `` Go ! ''
19.3957	Immediately the dozen lads darted frantically off .
712.9973	Several came near having a collision right in the start , which would have been fatal to their chances for winning out ; since the water in their kettles must have been spilled ; and according to the rules of the contest they could not refill the same without journeying to the creek , which Paul had made sure was fully fifty yards distant .
5.8464	It was a laughable , as well as interesting sight .
71.4629	Having reached the various places mentally selected as the scene of their intended operations in fire building , the boys set down their kettles , and commenced to feverishly whack away at dead branches , or other wood .
105.6752	In several instances two of them happened to pick out the same place , and naturally there was considerable rivalry between them , as well as an exchange of remarks intended to irritate and delay .
11.4308	`` Look at Wallace , will you ! ''
35.8042	observed Jack , presently ; `` nearly all the others have smoke going , but he 's chipping away as steadily as you please .
6.1236	Why , he seems in no hurry at all .
4.1703	I guess he does n't want to come in ahead ! ''
10.7571	`` Wait , my boy , '' laughed Paul .
6.9544	`` You do n't know that sly fox .
4.7031	He 's up to all the dodges at fire making , and believes in a good start .
62.5748	Some of those smokes never will amount to much , for they just struggle along , and threaten to go out because it takes all the puffing the fellows can give to keep them alive .
13.4868	Now he 's going to strike up .
13.3347	Only one match needed with Wallace , you see . ''
8.5958	`` And how his blaze jumps !
11.8145	You were right ; he made sure he had enough fine kindling first , before starting in .
11.4597	Now he 's adding larger stuff ; and what 's this he 's doing with those stones ? ''
7.9363	`` What do you suppose ? ''
7.0275	said the scout leader , nodding his head approvingly .
14.3076	`` Making a little fireplace where he can perch his kettle , and have the hottest part of his fire under it .
2.8711	Note also that the opening is in the direction of the breeze .
7.8454	That allows the flame to be fanned .
10.0338	Wallace will never have to blow out his cheeks and puff to keep his blaze going . ''
49.9434	By this time some of the contestants were bobbing their heads to ascertain just how Wallace had done it ; and made haste to follow suit .
10.6357	All were willing to take pattern from a past master who knew the wrinkles of the game .
8.3623	One upset his kettle , and despairing of having any show , withdrew from the race .
67.9060	Eleven fires kept on burning , some of them under protest , apparently , for they did not give much promise of landing their unlucky builders as victors .
10.1733	`` How long is it ? ''
19.6978	asked Jack , presently , as certain signs caught his eye that told him the end was near .
75.7397	`` Just nine minutes ; but -- '' `` Look at Wallace , '' cried Jack ; `` he 's raising his hat .
8.1265	There goes an inspector to see .
9.6736	He nods his head .
2.4054	The water must be boiling ; and who would have thought it ?
14.5689	Hurrah for the Carberry Twin !
18.2811	Look at Ted and Ward !
6.6878	They act as if they thought there was some trickery , for they 're running up to see .
23.5049	I guess they 've tried this game , and come in under the wire in about fifteen minutes .
9.9755	Hello !
8.6766	there 's Bluff calling out .
12.3946	Good boy !
13.4605	He 's going to run Wallace a race next time .
2.6403	But I 'd like to see you make the test , Paul ? ''
9.6194	Paul made no reply to this remark of his chum .
53.8418	Having studied the charms of outdoor life always , he knew that he would be placing his friends under a heavy handicap if he ever attempted to compete with them in woodlore .
230.9251	True , just as he said , Wallace was somewhat of an unknown quantity ; for he , too , seemed to have a deep love for everything connected with life in the forest , and never tired of reading books that told of pioneers and their ways .
2.9845	The scout leader immediately started some of the boys along another tack .
1252.7533	They were given a chance to find a lost trail , to detect all manner of signs such as would be apt to tell how long previously some one had passed that way ; and to discover where the tracks came out of the creek , upon the bed of which the unknown had walked quite some distance .
61.9995	Of course , Paul had made the trail himself in the morning , running out here on his wheel so as to prepare the ground .
138.3791	And when they all failed to find out just how the party had left the creek , since the marked tracks did not seem to appear anywhere along the banks , he pointed to where the limb of a tree hung down over the water .
7.0698	`` That 's the ticket ! ''
11.6856	cried Bobolink , excitedly .
3.4626	`` See , fellows , how it 's skinned where his shoes scraped along it . ''
2.9506	`` As sure as shooting he climbed up into that tree ! ''
19.8150	declared one , excitedly .
2.7905	`` Then scatter , and examine the ground around the trunk ! ''
19.8725	said Paul .
191.9099	A minute or so later a happy whoop announced that one of the searchers had discovered the wished-for signs ; and away the whole troop went on a trot , following the leader .
5.3207	Meanwhile the photographers managed to get in some of their efforts , possibly unbeknown to the rest .
35.8248	Exposures where the subjects are unconscious of their posing always turn out best ; since they avoid stiffness , such as ruins so many otherwise interesting pictures .
411.8750	Here , with the woods for a background , Paul , acting by agreement as temporary scout master , drilled his followers in scout law , sign , salute , and the significance of the badges which they wore , all of them , of course , of the tenderfoot type , since few had as yet started to qualify for any higher plane .
34.3128	Signal flags had been brought along ; and a class in semaphore work proved that some of the members of the troop were making rapid progress along that line .
236.6187	They had mastered the Morse code , too ; and had the occasion arisen might have sent messages over the wire , although probably none save Paul could have received the same , unless the words came painfully slow .
148.9435	The afternoon passed almost before they realized it ; and more than a few declared that the sun must have dropped like a plummet , when they found twilight creeping upon the forest .
4.8374	Both Ted and Ward had long since gone away , as though disgusted .
163.8589	They had tried to sneer at the work of Stanhope Troop No. 1 ; but every one knew this humor was assumed ; and that secretly they were eating their very hearts out for envy .
213.4541	No doubt there would be a hot time among their followers , when the leaders endeavored to drive them to beat the record Wallace Carberry had set in his fire starting , and water-boiling test .
636.8106	`` Suppose you come to supper with me , Paul , '' suggested Jack , when they were more than half way back to town , with the double column moving along like clockwork , every right leg thrust out in unison , as though forming a part of a well-regulated machine .
17.2736	Paul looked quickly at him when Jack said this .
9.2169	`` Oh !
5.7525	I can see through a millstone , when it has a hole in it , '' he remarked .
33.3967	`` Which is one way of saying that you can guess I have a motive in asking you ? ''
5.6622	returned the other , smiling queerly ; `` well , I have , in fact , several .
7.0450	In the first place my mother told me to ask you .
6.2679	I rather think she wants to pump you about that affair last night .
4.8672	Father would n't tell her all she wished to know .
26.5645	Then again I 'm still all broken up about those lost coins ; and I thought perhaps you might have guessed the answer to the riddle . ''
11.1550	`` What 's that ?
14.6764	More of them gone , Jack ? ''
46.7596	asked Paul , lowering his voice , so that the two scouts at the tail end of the line might not hear .
9.0206	`` Do n't know yet .
0.6215	Did n't have the nerve to go up into my den since this morning .
2.8509	To tell the truth that place has lost all charm for me .
229.8018	Whenever I find myself there I get to shivering , and looking around , just like I half expected to see a ghost step out , and pick up one of those miserable coins right before my very eyes -- ugh !
11.5607	it 's horrible to feel that way , and I used to be so fond of my den , too . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
13.4077	I hope and expect you will be again , Jack , when we 've settled this little thing .
5.0341	You say none of them were ever taken in the night ? ''
16.5175	said Paul , earnestly ; while his knitted brows told how much he felt concerned over the mystery .
10.6567	`` Certainly not .
22.0052	Always in broad daylight .
0.1772	That 's the queer part of it , '' returned the other , promptly .
23.2733	`` Sure , seeing that they always go in the daytime , and when you 're away from home , too .
12.7335	Anybody else going to be there to-night ? ''
8.4419	`` To supper -- oh !
9.9755	no .
26.1504	Karl went off after breakfast , to visit our uncle for a few days before school commences .
90.2758	I took him to the train myself , and then mustered up enough courage to climb up there , and once more count the coins , '' went on Jack .
15.1183	`` Six there then , eh ? ''
20.4206	asked Paul .
24.7781	`` Just as last night .
7.2123	And I purposely left the door unlocked . ''
5.4186	`` Both door and window open in the bargain ? ''
12.1311	asked the other ; at which Jack looked puzzled .
26.1722	`` Of course ; though that would n't matter at all ; for any fellow could turn the knob , and walk in , '' he replied .
165.7552	`` But the door was open , just like a plain invitation to enter , should anybody think of going up to see -- say that again , please , '' continued Paul .
17.5483	`` Well , I do say it again , though I ca n't understand why you should make that a point worth mentioning .
10.2450	Still , I have confidence in you , Paul .
10.5347	If anybody can get at the root of my trouble it 's going to be you , old fellow . ''
7.0447	`` I hope you prove a true prophet .
23.3592	As for myself I 'm not saying anything just yet , one way or another , '' smiled Paul .
17.0383	`` Yes , but I really believe that you 've found out something that gives you a pointer , Paul .
8.3831	Your face tells me that .
4.1326	You 're a wonder about following a trail in the woods .
2.7571	And I believe you see light in this darkness around me ! ''
0.4045	and Jack looked eagerly into the face of his chum as he said this .
36.0620	`` All I 'm going to confess is that I believe I 'm on the trail , and that it seems to be getting warmer the further I go .
27.4458	Just hold your horses a little while longer , Jack , and perhaps I may be able to tell you something . ''
2.9124	`` The way you smile gives me new courage , old fellow .
9.9755	Oh !
3.2213	I will be so glad if only it turns out all right .
7.3762	But here we are at the smithy .
14.2519	Shall you dismiss the troop here , Paul ? ''
9.2169	`` Yes .
278.6530	The boys must be pretty tired after last night 's work , and this hike ; as well as the many stunts they went through with , '' and the temporary master scout presently gave the order to break ranks , and head for home .
70.1465	`` Drop in at my house so I can tell my folks not to expect me to dinner , '' said Paul , as they approached his home .
4.0496	There was not the slightest objection to the programme as arranged .
123.3858	His parents trusted Paul fully , knowing that , while as fond of fun as the next lad , he never did things likely to get him into trouble .
128.1415	`` Now , first of all , '' remarked Paul , after they were indoors again ; `` let 's go up , and make sure that anything has happened . ''
5.0719	The door to Jack 's den stood wide open , inviting any one to enter .
19.4075	Jack had a match lighted in his hand , and with this he quickly touched the wick of a lamp .
261.2183	Paul heard him draw a long breath as he approached the spot where the little box lay upon the table desk at which stood the chair used by the owner of the den when taking his leisure here .
4.6922	He bent over , and seemed to be counting the coins .
76.7373	They dropped back into the receptacle one by one , and with such a ringing sound that even Paul was able to keep tally .
13.5609	Then Jack turned an anxious and white face around .
17.0277	`` Paul , there are only four here .
16.8852	Two more have gone ! ''
9.8387	he said .
2.4240	`` Yet you came up here and counted them ; you are positive of that ? ''
20.7468	demanded Paul .
8.8122	`` I counted them , and there were six .
47.4733	Five times I did it , to be sure ; yet you saw that there were only four just now ? ''
0.1952	`` You came up here after you saw Karl off on the train ? ''
10.9515	persisted his chum .
5.0585	`` Yes , after I returned from the station .
8.7074	But what makes you ask that ?
12.1754	Tell me why you are grinning so , Paul ?
9.9283	I know I 'm awfully dull just now , but who could blame me under the circumstances ?
9.4067	Please speak up ! ''
20.7291	Jack insisted .
5.3264	`` Why , do n't you see , this clears Karl completely .
128.9750	Six here while he was riding away on the train this morning ; and two taken when he is fifty miles away !
6.5313	Do n't that satisfy you it was n't your brother , after all , Jack ? ''
49.9896	And Jack dropped down in that chair , letting his head fall in his hands , while a great joy overspread his face .
4.2157	`` Paul , you 're a wizard , I do believe ! ''
0.3785	said Jack , after a bit , as he looked up at his chum .
7.2638	`` Well , I hardly think so .
15.9961	This thing was easy ; and ten to one you 'd have thought of it sooner or later .
41.4962	For how could Karl have anything to do with the bad business while he was up at your uncle 's ? ''
7.2502	laughed the other , with his customary modesty .
1.5294	`` But if not Karl , then who got my old coins ? ''
27.8815	persisted Jack , smiling now .
4.6505	`` Well , I 'm not quite ready to say .
14.6422	I 've got two ideas I 'm chasing after now .
3.5396	Give me just a little more time on that , will you , old fellow ? ''
27.7999	replied the visitor , as he dropped down on a cot , and let his eyes rove along the exhibit of college colors illuminating the walls .
4.0948	He drew the little box that held the coins toward him .
70.2934	When Jack was not observing , Paul took the contents out , one by one , and seemed to be examining them closely .
24.8199	He even scratched one with his finger nail , and the result appeared to please him , for he chuckled softly .
5.1204	Evidently he had made a discovery which he deemed important .
15.8811	Jack , having finished some little task with which he had busied himself , came back to his chum .
65.7361	`` See here , Paul , '' he remarked ; `` I 'm not going to ask you to tell me who it is you suspect ; but do I know him ? ''
74.7116	`` Sure , '' replied his chum ; `` and perhaps after we 've found out the wonderful secret , you may even find it in your heart to look on it as a joke , and forgive him . ''
8.2443	`` You do n't say ?
58.5357	Perhaps , though , I might hardly feel like forgiving a fellow who would be mean enough to sneak up here so often , and take my old coins .
0.2121	Think of the ugly feelings he 's made me have toward my own brother .
2.3335	I 'll never look Karl in the eye after this without feeling conscience-stricken .
10.2643	I do n't know about forgiving him so easy as all that , '' grumbled Jack .
9.2169	`` Oh !
2.7290	well , do n't cross a bridge till you come to it .
4.2542	That 's a good motto for you and for me .
3.8005	Perhaps there are times when I feel the need of it .
36.3236	Perhaps there 's one right now , '' and Paul shrugged his shoulders as he spoke , half laughingly .
1.5683	`` There , I knew that something had gone wrong with you lately .
5.8578	I 've watched you when you thought I was n't looking , and I 've seen you frown .
10.3203	Suppose you take your old chum into your confidence , Paul ?
10.4717	What 's happened ?
10.9583	Any trouble at home ?
3.8770	Are you bothered over the Boy Scout troop we 've been organizing ?
7.7633	Is it about your school affairs ? ''
6.8227	Paul shook his head each time the other brought forward a suggestion .
261.8541	`` You 're a most determined fellow , Jack , '' he said , good naturedly ; `` and perhaps I had n't ought to speak of such a thing to anybody ; but we 've been chums so long , and misery likes company , you know . ''
5.7944	`` Then you _ are _ in trouble ; and you mean to confess to me ?
10.2340	Thank you , Paul , for what you say .
15.1739	I do n't think I ever had any cause for worrying that I did n't come straight to you for comfort .
6.1852	And I always got it , too . ''
313.7481	`` Even when you and Dorothy had that nasty little spat that began to look serious until I just happened to find the note that made all the trouble , and forced Eli Kosmer to confess he wrote it .
13.3550	You remember that time , Jack ? ''
8.3855	`` I guess I do .
27.6972	Dorothy often speaks of it to this day ; for we 're good friends , and always will be .
1.7237	But see here , why do you just happen to mention that business ?
9.9755	Oh !
97.9788	I begin to see now , '' added Jack , as Paul turned red in the face , and laughed in a rather constrained way .
5.3219	`` I should n't wonder but what you did .
11.2449	I 'm sure I 've denied every other cause you could think of , '' he said , sighing heavily .
15.3255	`` It 's Arline then .
8.2562	She 's been doing something .
18.7982	Yes , I remember now that I saw her out riding with Ward Kenwood only yesterday .
31.2203	Say , that dude has been saying something that was n't true about you , Paul , I 'd just wager anything .
4.8602	He 's gone and poisoned her ears with a yarn .
6.6382	It 'd be just like the sneak ! ''
16.4202	`` Just go slow , Jack .
5.9155	You 're saying something that you ca n't prove .
117.9159	Of course I believe myself that Ward would n't stop at anything like that ; but without the least proof I ca n't accuse him of it , '' Paul said , severely .
12.7469	`` But you could ask Arline ? ''
9.3844	his friend went on .
9.0274	`` Could I ?
167.3415	Well , when a girl chooses to turn me down without a hearing , and even smiles when she drives past me in the company of a fellow she knows I detest , and whom she has often said she disliked , what then ?
35.0796	Think I would so far forget myself as to get down on my knees , and beg her to take me back into favor ?
11.3748	Bah ! ''
6.5824	`` Is it so bad as that then ?
387.7427	Oh well , there are other girls just as pretty as Arline ; and you 've always been a great favorite with them , Paul ; but hold on , why not let me try to straighten this thing out ?
2.1087	You 've helped me all right ; and tit for tat is fair play . ''
9.5751	`` H 'm !
12.1255	how do you think you could do anything , Jack ?
39.6958	I do n't suppose you 'd care to go straight to her , and ask her point blank what I 'd done to make her treat me so cruelly ?
4.6108	I should n't think of allowing that at all ? ''
242.3319	Paul tried to display an air of indifference ; but it was poorly assumed ; and his chum knew full well that he was much more pained at these strange actions on the part of Arline than he cared to admit .
9.2169	`` Oh !
8.2027	there are ways and ways .
34.4287	For instance , you know that Dorothy is one of the crowd of high school girls Arline goes with .
25.0533	Ward 's sister Mazie is another ; and that might account for her being at his house so much .
20.8329	Now , suppose you let me tell Dorothy .
4.9819	She 'll keep it a dead secret , and in some way manage to get a confession .
14.0797	Say you will , Paul ! ''
5.7035	`` Have it your own way , old fellow .
1.7888	I 'm just about ready to wash my hands of the whole business .
15.2023	Besides , I 've really too many irons in the fire to be bothering over the silly notions of girls . ''
105.8951	It was bravely put , but did not deceive Jack even a little bit ; for he happened to know just how very fond his friend was of the particular girl in question .
8.7516	`` All right , then .
20.4470	Consider that settled , and I wo n't say any more about it until I can report progress , '' remarked the latter .
4.4596	`` Let 's talk of other things than my poor affairs .
1.4016	You insisted on knowing ; and would n't take no for an answer .
9.9755	Hello !
7.3149	there 's Carlo asking to come in again .
15.4672	Shall I let him past the door , Jack ? ''
9.0810	`` Why , of course .
7.2915	This is his den as well as mine .
3.2041	I keep sugar on tap , so as to put him through some of his paces .
7.9913	Here Carlo , how 's your sweet tooth coming on ? ''
12.1045	and Jack snapped his fingers in a peculiar way .
358.8229	Immediately the educated dog squatted on his hind quarters , sat upright with his forepaws drooping appealingly , and waited , cocking his eyes in a humorous way at his young master , who had opened a drawer in his desk .
18.0976	`` Just one piece left .
9.4295	Somebody else likes sugar as well as Carlo , I guess .
13.5611	Well , here you are , now .
8.2429	On trust , boy , on trust ! ''
20.7943	So saying he laid the piece of sugar upon the nose of the dog , balancing it so there could be no falling off .
172.0581	Carlo , knowing what was expected of him , sat there like a drum major , quivering with eagerness , yet not daring to move as long as he failed to hear the command .
2.8317	`` Say , is n't he a sport , all right , Paul ?
8.0399	Do n't he sit up like a soldier ?
8.0203	Look at his eyes fixed on me .
9.3896	Did you ever see such agony ? ''
27.1971	Paul was laughing now .
18.1291	`` He 's speaking with his eyes , and begging you not to stretch it out too far , Jack .
7.6020	Have a little mercy on the poor beggar .
5.7980	Look at his tongue coming out and reaching up .
6.9793	I think he just wants to taste that sugar .
13.5524	Give it to him now ! ''
50.6926	`` Well , Carlo knows that he ca n't expect to have anything on trust ; but it 's a different thing when it 's paid for ! ''
21.7323	With the last two words , spoken in a natural tone , Carlo became galvanized into sudden action .
2.9506	He had received the cue for which he was waiting so patiently .
590.9742	Immediately he made an upward spring ; the lump of sugar was thrown into the air , and as it came down one quick snap secured it , after which there was a crunching of canine teeth , and a look of bliss appeared on Carlo 's dog face .
8.1179	`` There 's the supper gong .
7.4519	Come on down to the bathroom and wash up , Paul !
6.6394	And you come , too , old dog .
4.6589	No more sugar here ; see , the drawer is empty .
7.3479	Carlo never comes up here without sniffing at that drawer , and looking at me knowingly .
2.7630	Go ahead , Paul , and I 'll put out the lamp . ''
146.0257	So they went downstairs , and after a while sought the dining room , where Paul met both parents of his chum , as well as a gentleman who was visiting Mr. Stormways .
145.4411	`` Mr. Jared Pender , an old schoolmate of mine , and with whom I made several voyages abroad years ago , '' said Mr. Stormways .
28.5299	`` He is in the employ of the Government now , and has to make visits all over the country , you know . ''
739.4508	Paul had once met a gentleman who was a post-office inspector , and somehow took it for granted that Mr. Pender might be engaged in some similar business ; at any rate it concerned him not at all he concluded , just what the gentleman 's private affairs might be , and he gave the subject little thought .
0.8470	After supper the two boys once more ascended to the snuggery near the roof .
44.9998	There was no further reference made to either the disappearance of the old coins , or Paul 's little heart trouble with his girl chum .
257.4598	They had a number of books loaned them by the good old minister and which were full of interesting facts connected with the wonderful Boy Scout movement , especially over in England , where it originated .
5.9150	Paul was deeply interested in picking out all features that would appeal to American lads .
126.3664	Until they had found the right party to take the position of troop master he wished to play the part of scout leader in such fashion that no one could pick a flaw with his management .
449.9065	Usually it is some adult to whom this important position is entrusted from the start ; Paul , however , had long been known to be so deeply interested in many of the branches which concern life in the open , that his mates were only too glad to have him occupy the exalted position of leader for the time being .
45.3795	When they knew as much as Paul did , they believed they would be well qualified to pass for a first-class scout 's assignment .
3.3995	So Paul , with the assistance of his comrade , was selecting many interesting competitions .
14.1493	By means of these the boys could be tested as to their knowledge of those things so important to the boy scouts .
16.6606	He made many charts showing the different footprints of wild animals , as well as those of the domestic cat and dog .
10.0610	By following the tracks of a rabbit a most interesting as well as instructive story could be made out .
349.6960	It was possible just from the marks on the ground , or the snow , to tell how the animal had been frightened into wild flight , by what sort of enemy it had been pursued , where the swoop of owl or eagle had brought specks of blood upon the leaves or white snow , and finally the picked bones of poor bunny would reveal the secret of the windup of the chase .
8.1997	So , in every case , the student of nature could weave a story out of the marks discovered .
95.5197	It was so in the days of the Indian , when old Leatherstocking and his long-barreled rifle were leading factors in the life of the wilds .
38.5944	Daniel Boone and his pioneers used to read such signs as easily as any boy might the pages of this book .
4.9212	And the deeper any lad dips into such fascinating studies the more he wants to learn .
18.0752	When half past nine came Paul said he must be going .
22.6137	`` I 've had a jolly evening of it , Jack , and enjoyed every minute with you .
80.8925	When we get the boys together again we can have half a dozen competitions going on at once , '' he said as he arose and stretched himself .
203.1163	`` That 's so , '' replied the other , following suit ; while even Carlo arched his broad back , and prepared to follow them downstairs ; `` and the best of this thing is that the more you go into it the greater it gets .
5.6093	I 'm fairly wild to keep it up . ''
140.0998	Just as the boys reached the lower floor the telephone bell rang , and Jack , being near , stepped over to the small table in the hall on which the receiver rested .
6.1369	`` Yes , sure , he 's here .
133.0453	Hold the wire , '' Paul heard him say , as he smiled ; and then turning to his friend Jack continued : `` here , Paul , take hold .
8.8934	Somebody wants to talk with you .
5.3305	Says he called up your house , and they told him you were over at my home . ''
33.1448	Paul of course wondered who could be wanting him so positively that he even followed him over to the Stormways house .
9.2169	`` Hello !
9.2169	hello ! ''
9.4547	he said , quietly .
12.7739	`` That you , Paul ? ''
43.5891	`` It 's Bobolink , I guess , '' remarked Paul , for the benefit of his chum who stood by , listening curiously .
2.8707	`` That 's right , '' continued the voice over the wire .
5.9420	`` What 's doing to make you chase me up this way , Number Three ? ''
19.0024	Paul went on .
1.4282	`` That 's the trouble ; I just do n't know for sure .
103.6686	But when I caught Ted 's voice among the bunch I said to myself , they 're up to no good ; and I bet it 's Paul they are laying for . ''
9.2169	`` Hey !
12.2541	what 's that ?
7.9192	Who 's laying for me , and where ? ''
10.9279	demanded the startled boy .
3.4540	`` Listen , and I 'll tell you all I learned .
193.5207	` Taint much , but I know that critter so well that I would n't put it past him to try and knock you out , so that all our drilling in the woods would be upset , and his crowd get an advantage . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
12.2025	bosh !
4.9741	What 's this you 're giving me , Bobolink ? ''
5.2598	`` Yes , I expected you 'd say that .
7.7674	Think I 'm stringing you , do n't you , Paul ?
5.6098	But I 'm not , all the same .
11.3685	Listen again .
171.2787	Perhaps Ted and two of his cronies have gone and dressed up in some old Hallowe'en toggery until they look like a set of bears or hyenas just to frolic around a bit .
17.5807	Well , mebbe they have ; but tell me just why they are hiding close to _ your _ place ? ''
9.5718	continued the talkative yet determined Bobolink .
7.2657	`` When did you see them ? ''
9.9486	demanded the other .
24.2613	`` Not more 'n eight minutes ago , Paul .
8.8333	Was comin ' home myself .
49.3117	Been over to Bluff 's house to fix up some surprises we expect to play on all you fellers later on , and show you what we know about this scoutin ' business .
3.6411	On the way home I turned in and passed your house .
44.8964	Often come that way , you know , '' and the speaker paused as if for breath , or to hear Paul admit the fact .
11.4864	`` Sure .
8.6392	Go on , you slow turtle .
8.6895	You 've got me keyed up now to my top-notch curiosity .
2.8036	Give us the rest of the yarn , '' said Paul , eagerly .
11.1971	`` Yarn !
10.4339	H 'm !
2.4589	there you go , making out I 'm hatching up a story .
209.6891	But take my word for it , Paul , three fellers are hidin ' in the bushes close to your place , and expectin ' some one to pass along in the dark .
105.9644	They started to jump out at me , and then I heard Ted 's voice growlin ' to 'em to fade away , that it was n't the right one .
1.5484	Thought I 'd just ask you if you could explain what it meant .
27.1616	When your mother told me you was over with Jack I saw a light , and that 's what . ''
3.7250	`` Well , I 'm glad you told me , Bobolink .
14.6928	A good scout is always on the alert to do his comrade a clever turn ; and I wo n't forget this .
8.4583	That all ? ''
109.5019	`` But now I 've told you , Paul , are n't you goin ' to slip around the back way , and let them fellers take it out waitin ' ?
23.1963	Three to one is too much .
1.4792	They 'll do you up , and make out 't was only horseplay .
15.3516	Please give 'em the slip , Paul .
4.0175	We need you in our business , you know . ''
6.8038	`` I 'll see about it , Bobolink .
10.2633	Thanks , good-bye ! ''
17.3038	and Paul switched off .
4.2362	`` Well , what 's all this about ? ''
80.5752	asked Jack , as his chum turned toward him , with a frown on his face , and a gleam in his eye that the other knew stood for grim determination .
159.2013	`` He says there are three fellows lying in wait in the bushes near my place , all rigged up in their Hallowe'en toggery ; and that he believes they know I am over at your house .
23.0910	That 's all , '' remarked Paul , with a little nervous laugh , and a clinching of his hands .
12.1971	`` Good gracious !
2.7390	you do n't say ; three of them waiting to pounce on you !
5.8378	Did he seem to know who they were ? ''
19.7166	asked Jack , looking worried .
3.4884	`` Well , you might guess that easy enough , '' replied Paul , scornfully .
14.4693	`` Ted Slavin and some of his ugly ducklings ? ''
14.3304	`` Bobolink says he recognized Ted 's voice .
4.1970	And , I suppose my warm friend Ward is one of the others .
1.5448	He never loses a chance to get a dig in at me . ''
955.0171	`` I do n't know , '' returned Jack , thoughtfully ; `` to tell the honest truth I hardly think he can be one of the bunch , because his sister took Arline home with her to supper ; and I guess Ward could n't be coaxed out while _ she _ is there . ''
16.9557	Paul winced , but said nothing .
9.2169	`` Oh !
6.0380	well , it does n't matter much after all .
7.8443	They 're a lot of cowards , or else they would n't be concerned in such a low game .
464.8601	You can give them the slip by going around the back way , '' and Jack chuckled at the thought of those silly fellows waiting an hour or two for the expected victim who never came , and then going home in sheer disgust .
19.0658	Paul shook his head .
266.6579	`` Now , that 's just what Bobolink said , too ; but I 've made up my mind that I 'm not going to sneak home , like a dog with his tail between his legs , '' he said , shutting his teeth hard together .
4.6237	`` You mean that you 'll take the street that leads to the front of your house ?
21.7600	Oh I well , they 'll hardly tackle us when they see there are two , '' remarked Jack .
4.6731	`` And by that you mean you expect to go along .
5.1027	I wo n't let you do anything of the kind .
31.7769	Even if they allowed us to pass by , do n't you think they 'd be apt to take it out of you when you returned alone ?
42.9791	No , I 'm your superior officer , and I order you to stop right here where you belong ; do you understand , Jack ? ''
462.3931	`` Well , '' grumbled Jack , shaking his head as if convinced against his will ; `` I know you too well to try and go up against you when your mind 's made up ; but just the same I think it 's a mean shame that you wo n't let me walk home with you .
19.3292	Think if they did jump out at us what a jolly time we 'd have handing 'em more than they expected . ''
7.1762	`` Give it up , old fellow .
5.7012	But I tell you what I can do .
2.6249	You remember that baseball bat of mine that 's been lying over here so long ?
26.7148	I 'll carry it home now , and save you the trouble , thank you , '' nodded Paul .
11.3416	`` Bully !
10.4817	a good idea .
8.5079	Here it is behind the door .
9.8524	And Paul , do n't spare the measly bunch ; but whack 'em good and hard . ''
10.6117	Paul walked down the street , swinging the baseball bat carelessly , and softly whistling to himself .
9.0174	He left the street on which his chum 's house fronted , and presently came to his own thoroughfare .
8.7164	`` H 'm ! ''
47.2630	he said to himself , as he boldly turned in here ; `` looks kind of half dark for a fact ; but that always suits fellows up to a mean dodge .
44.6384	I mus n't hit too hard , for this is an awful tough old bat , that has brought me in more than a few home-runs .
17.6644	Well , it 's helping me make one now , '' and he actually snickered at the conceit .
5.2675	As he advanced he braced himself for the expected fray .
33.0776	Of old he knew Ted Slavin was a muscular fellow , capable of enforcing obedience from his slavish followers .
12.2541	What was that ?
4.5913	He certainly heard the sound of voices a little further along .
106.4087	And somehow one of them seemed to give Paul a strange feeling ; for he was positive that it was a girl 's tones ; and he recognized them too !
188.7342	Ward Kenwood was taking Arline home ; and for some unknown reason chose to select this very street as a part of his route , although it was a little out of the way .
50.0978	How strange that they should all come together just at that very identical spot , where the trio of ambushed boys were crouching , ready to spring out .
11.9894	Ah !
16.3070	Paul caught sight of something moving close by .
0.2365	He felt sure that it must be the concealed fellows , launching their boom .
11.9423	Yes , now he could make out their figures as they emerged from the bushes on the jump .
19.2513	Some one screamed .
20.9486	It must be Arline , frightened by the appearance of these ugly , uncouth forms dancing upon the pavement .
442.3846	Instantly the greatest confusion existed , with the ambushers attacking Paul , to shout in consternation when he began to thump them heartily on the legs and backs with his baseball bat ; and the girl standing there trying to shut out , with her clasped hands , the strange sight , seen so dimly in the half darkness .
33.6106	The patter of feet down the street told only too well where her protector had gone ; but he was valiantly calling lustily for help as he ran .
881.1031	Met by such a determined opposition , overwhelmed by the shower of punches and whacks that seemed to be freighted with painful reminders ; and startled by the cries of the fleeing Ward , not to mention the little shrieks of Arline , the three boys who had been the cause of all this excitement soon had enough .
8.1405	`` Skip out , fellers ! ''
20.8864	roared Ted , as he almost doubled up when the swinging bat came with considerable force against his ribs .
7.5827	The others were only too willing to obey .
98.7834	Away they clattered after the fleeing Ward , who , hearing what he took to be a hot pursuit , let loose more vigorously than ever , still crying for assistance .
18.6352	Paul was laughing now , for the comical side of the thing seemed to have occurred to him .
6.0136	He took out a match and struck it .
117.4569	As the light flamed up , Arline , who had by now ceased her cries of alarm , possibly guessing the truth , stared at the face of the victor .
9.2169	`` Oh !
20.6106	Paul !
8.2523	is it you ? ''
17.5245	she said ; and somehow he seemed to understand that she was more than glad of the opportunity to make up with him .
149.7359	Boylike he pretended to hold back , and as the light went out , leaving them once more in the gloom , he remarked : `` Yes , those fellows were lying in wait for me .
1.6686	They expected to give me a sound thumping ; but I was warned and ready .
3.6542	I 'm sorry that you were annoyed by the row , Miss Blair .
4.3172	I 'll stay here with you until your company comes back .
5.9297	I think he must have gone for help ! ''
8.9614	this with some bitterness and scorn .
8.5367	She moved closer to him .
4.8663	Possibly the darkness made her afraid ; and then again some other cause may have influenced her .
36.5632	Paul felt her hand on his arm , and was thrilled when she said : `` Please do n't mention him to me again .
9.9755	Oh !
0.2860	what a miserable coward , to run off and leave a girl that way .
11.2429	Wo n't _ you _ take me home , Paul ? ''
4.1988	He could not say anything for a minute , he was so overcome .
16.2972	And perhaps Arline thought he must still be angry because she had treated him so shabbily of late .
13.1436	`` Please , please do , Paul .
9.6326	I want to tell you how sorry I am for believing what came to me in a roundabout way .
6.9268	I 'll never forgive myself , never ! ''
6.5885	she went on , clinging to his arms .
17.3240	Paul could hold out no longer .
2.7812	`` Of course I will , Arline , and glad of the chance .
0.2366	Come on before anybody hurries out to see what all this noise means . ''
73.4597	So they walked down the street together , Paul with his faithful bat tucked under one arm , and a pretty girl clinging , oh !
13.7806	so confidingly to the other .
171.1534	But the boys of Stanhope often made more or less of a noise on the streets after dark , being filled with exurberant spirits ; and so no one thought it worth while to investigate what all the racket meant .
102.0863	Paul heard what had been carried to the ears of Arline , and had no trouble in proving to her complete satisfaction that he was entirely innocent of the charge .
18.3230	`` And to think that I allowed myself to believe it , '' said the girl , almost crying ; `` oh !
15.7521	Paul , will you ever forgive me ?
3.4384	Nothing can ever make me listen to anything wrong about you again .
1.9740	I wonder if he had a hand in hatching that wretched story up .
3.7921	If I knew it I would tell him to his face what I thought of him ! ''
16.8207	`` You mean Ward .
9.4449	Please do n't do that .
1.7443	I really ca n't believe any fellow would be so mean and low .
1.5926	It must have been just accident that coupled my name with that affair .
59.7336	But I 'm satisfied if you say we 're going to be just as good friends as ever , '' Paul said , warmly .
11.6323	`` Better than ever , I hope , Paul .
8.2727	I 've had my lesson .
9.9657	It will never happen again , I promise you , '' she answered , pressing his arm as she spoke .
238.8873	So Paul saw her safely to her door , and then said good-night ; but Arline insisted upon shaking hands with him ; and the tingle of his fingers as he walked down the street made him laugh with joy .
9.0847	`` What luck ! ''
51.1573	he kept saying to himself , as he made out to shake his own hand ; `` and what a mess of it Ward made of his chances .
11.2740	He thought to have the laugh on me if we met , and here the shoe is on the other foot .
9.9755	Oh !
7.8103	I 'm not complaining a little bit .
14.1008	Everything 's coming my way now . ''
8.4969	Nothing further happened on his way home .
33.9756	But when he reached the house his father met him with the announcement that Jack was holding the wire , and waiting for him .
9.3780	`` On deck there ! ''
4.0163	he said , briskly , and heard an exclamation of relief .
15.9019	`` How is it , Paul ?
11.3691	Anything doing ?
54.1545	Seemed to me I heard an awful racket over your way ; but the nine-forty train was just coming in at the station , and drowned it out .
7.7949	Did they tackle you , son ? ''
19.9457	demanded Jack , eagerly .
8.8740	`` Did they ?
8.8580	Well , I guess some !
20.3450	Ask Ted , '' chuckled the one addressed .
1.4317	`` You 're laughing , and that tells me you enjoyed the circus .
0.6606	What did you do to poor old Ted and his cronies , Paul ? ''
10.3031	entreated the other .
2.9454	`` I could tell you easier what I did n't do to 'em , Jack .
14.5690	I gave the boys about every style of punch and jab I could think of , and with my home-run bat too .
9.9755	Oh !
2.9277	make up your mind they 're going to be a sore lot in the morning .
0.5502	And if you run up against Ted , just sniff the air for arnica .
1.7178	My word for it , he 'll empty the bottle to-night on his bruises . ''
11.3416	`` Bully !
12.0433	bully !
11.4828	and again bully !
25.3978	I would have rushed to assist you only you made me promise to keep my hands off ; and you 're my superior officer , you see .
59.2761	Besides , I reckoned that with such a hunky-dory bat you 'd be able to give just pie , which you did , Paul . ''
1.4783	`` But the half has n't been told yet , '' went on the narrator .
9.2169	`` What !
3.5595	do you mean there 's a sequel to this story ? ''
11.4294	asked Jack , burning with eagerness apparently , to hear .
5.6416	`` I guess that 's what it is .
11.2113	Listen .
14.0758	Ward was just taking a young lady home .
108.6952	He chose to pass along our street , though now he wishes he had n't ; for they arrived just when Ted and his backers jumped out of the bushes .
2.7902	She screamed , and her escort sprinted down the street for help .
223.8047	After I had punched and pounded the three Hallowe'en left-overs from last year until they faded away , I had the pleasure of seeing the young lady to her door , yum !
11.2994	yum ! ''
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
2.6934	and I bet all differences are patched up again between you ! ''
21.0516	cried Jack .
0.4740	`` Everything is lovely , and the goose hangs high , '' sang Paul .
18.9237	`` Meaning poor old blundering Ward .
1.4128	He showed himself for a coward to the girl he 's sweet on .
9.9755	Oh !
8.4583	my , oh !
7.6366	me , how is the mighty fallen .
5.2533	Congratulations , good friend , and then more of them .
1.8179	So the clouds have disappeared along your horizon , just as they did on mine .
1.5918	I only wish I 'd had a hand in clearing your skies . ''
8.9676	`` So you did .
12.5298	You kept that baseball bat of mine until the right minute came .
3.4346	Only for that my name might have been mud , '' laughed Paul .
138.5683	`` And if you 'd only open your heart now , and give me a hint about the fellow you believe has been playing that trick on me with my old coins -- '' `` Just you wait a little .
9.2328	It 's coming soon .
16.2117	So-long ! ''
5.8558	and with a click the connection was cut off .
13.9507	`` How are you , Paul ? ''
635.7936	It was Mr. Jared Pender who came out of the post-office as Paul happened to be passing the next day , and addressed the boy he had met on the preceding evening at the house of the Stormways .
9.7433	`` Why , how do you do , Mr. Pender ?
27.3331	Been at work , I see , '' replied Paul , with a suggestive look in the direction of the post-office .
0.4823	The tall dark gentleman looked a little perplexed , and followed Paul 's glance .
7.7330	Then an expression of understanding passed over his face .
9.2169	`` Ah !
6.5199	yes , I see , you are a good guesser , Paul .
9.1561	But please do not mention the fact to any one .
55.1622	We Government officials sometimes have to work _ sub rosa _ , as the saying is ; that means without any one knowing what we are at .
15.3875	You understand , Paul ? ''
12.2853	`` Yes , sir , I guess I do ; but I hope there 's nothing wrong here at our post-office .
9.0062	We all think the world of Mr. Mygatt , and his clerks , '' said Paul .
9.2169	`` Oh !
8.2285	do n't mention such a thing .
2.1285	We have to investigate many times just to discover how smoothly things are going on .
8.5238	Is n't that Jack 's dog coming out with a package of papers in his mouth ?
6.2846	Has he actually been down for the mail ? ''
9.6937	went on the gentleman .
12.2613	`` That 's Carlo , all right .
2.8037	Sometimes they give him the mail when there are no letters , as you see . ''
15.6338	`` And will he carry the bundles home safely , without stopping to play with other dogs , or to fight ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
18.2012	Carlo knows his duty .
6.5940	He never forgets what is expected of him .
99.2611	There , sir , look at him halting for a minute at the open door of the butcher shop , to wag his tail , and peep in .
1.7012	It smells mighty inviting to him , I wager ; but will he go in ?
14.1040	Not much .
4.1885	See , there he goes along , heading straight for home .
103.8160	If another dog picked a fight with him , Carlo would lay that package down , give the cur a good licking , then pick the papers up again , and trot along . ''
10.1755	`` I see you know his traits well , Paul , '' remarked the gentleman , smiling .
5.4173	`` Some of them , but not all .
5.1744	He 's a great dog , all right , and Jack 's fond of him . ''
3.8530	`` I suppose money could n't buy him , then ? ''
20.7725	suggested Mr. Pender .
1.3665	`` It would be useless to try it , sir , I think .
17.4290	Will you stay long with Mr. Stormways ? ''
7.3123	`` That I can not say .
38.9958	My business may be completed in a day , and it may keep me in this vicinity for a week .
9.7644	That depends on circumstances .
713.6065	You have been around more or less , Paul ; do you happen to remember seeing a large red touring car , with a khaki-colored cover , and occupied by two men , one of whom has a glass eye ? ''
178.6214	Paul stared at the tall gentleman , as though he thought at first the other might be joking him ; but seeing not a ripple of a smile on the dark face , he changed his mind .
4.9273	`` Why , no , sir ; I ca n't seem to remember seeing that particular car .
7.8257	Of course red ones are common ; but most of them have black tops , if any at all .
13.0585	Some friends of yours , Mr. Pender ? ''
9.7692	he remarked , naturally .
426.4219	The gentleman allowed just a twinkle to appear in the corners of his eyes as he nodded his head , and said : `` Well , er -- yes , very particular friends of mine , Paul , and whom I would be glad to see again right now .
40.7058	If you happen to sight such a machine , and I am still at my old friend , Stormways , I wish you would let me know about it . ''
31.3334	`` I certainly will , sir ; and perhaps you 'd like me to speak to the gentlemen , and tell them how anxious you are to see them ? ''
7.4645	Paul went on ; at which the other gave a laugh .
3.0700	`` I see you are on to me , my boy .
1.7463	You guess that such is the very last thing I would want you to do .
98.8608	Now , I 'm going to take you into my confidence , Paul , '' he went on , bending his head lower , and giving a quick glance around .
23.5146	`` Yes , sir ; that 's very kind of you , Mr. Pender , '' said the lad , smiling .
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.0535	I do n't know .
13.0285	I have an axe to grind in doing so ; for I believe that you can be of assistance to me .
58.3566	The two men in that motor car are criminals , for whose capture I have come to this part of the country , Paul . ''
11.2567	`` Goodness !
11.0747	that sounds interesting , sir .
7.8119	What have they been doing ? ''
5.0230	asked the young scout leader , with boyish curiosity brimming over .
7.4928	`` I wo n't tell you that , Paul ; but they are wanted by the Government .
24.5235	And sometimes we agents have to go about our business with great caution , in order to discover enough evidence on the suspects to convict .
49.1365	So , above all things , I do not wish to alarm these clever gentlemen unduly , lest they manage to hide , or get rid of the only burden of proof .
9.4332	In other words , as a common expression has it , I want to get them with the goods on .
9.3307	You understand ? ''
5.1661	`` Yes , sir ; I think I do .
3.3557	And if I see or hear anything about that red car , I 'll tell you .
7.2186	But is it true that you and Jack 's father were chums long ago ? ''
58.8053	`` That 's the positive truth , my boy , '' replied the agent , nodding ; `` why , we took several voyages together , and had lots of queer adventures .
61.6323	I never dreamed that my wild old friend Alan would settle down to this humdrum life , as a lumber merchant , and the head of a family .
3.6319	But I suppose it all came of his meeting a girl .
59.7610	And after knowing his fine wife I do n't blame him a bit ; though I 've kept right along in the same old groove , and see more or less of adventure . ''
344.3154	`` He 's a mighty fine man , and they think lots of him here , '' declared Paul , who was amazed to learn that his chum 's parent could have , once upon a time , been reckoned a wild blade .
52.7639	Paul walked on with his lips puckered up as if whistling , and his face filled with the new interest that had taken possession of him .
193.5257	He had read accounts in the papers of Boy Scouts being concerned in many useful enterprises ; and he wondered whether he and his patrol might not find a chance to assist the officers of justice in rounding up a couple of rogues who had apparently broken the laws of the land .
5.4854	Then other things came up to draw his attention elsewhere .
16.5858	He ran across boys on the street , who asked dozens of questions about the many interesting features of the new organization .
136.2682	These were often lads who had begun to think of uniting with one of the rival troops ; and Paul was only too glad to give them all the information in his power .
1.7908	They wanted more recruits , provided the applicants were of the right sort .
103.5360	Those their committee rejected might find solace in joining forces with Ted 's crowd , who , not being at all particular , would receive them with open arms .
435.2905	That afternoon there was another meeting in the woods , at which every member of Stanhope Troop No 1 , as they now determined to call their organization , did his best to be present .
158.2466	Paul had given several of the boys duties to perform , that were part and parcel of the grand scheme to whip his company into first-class shape in a shorter time than it had taken any other troop .
5.5829	Reports were received and filed of numerous things done which would count in the final summing up .
125.6025	These were to be accompanied by vouchers from the persons interested , which could be filed away for inspection when the committee appointed by the giver of the fine banner looked through the records of the several patrols competing for the prize .
176.9093	Andy Flinn and Philip Towns reported that they had cleaned up the beautiful green in front of the town high school , and which was generally known as the campus .
39.8321	It was kept mowed by the town authorities ; but numerous scraps of paper and trash , blowing hither and thither in the wind , gave it an unsightly appearance .
1927.4775	`` Never forget that you have taken our campus under your protecting care , Numbers Three and Four of the Gray Fox patrol , '' said the head scout , after reading the report ; `` of course it is always your privilege to enlist smaller boys in the job , if you can do so without actually hiring them .
8.9913	That is expressly forbidden . ''
190.6743	Then came Wallace Carberry and Tom Betts , telling how they had started a crusade to cover the entire town with receptacles to contain stray rubbish .
380.7120	Half a dozen cans had already been ordered , each one of which was to have in startling red letters the significant picture of a staring eye , and followed by the words , `` Eat Trash ! ''
21.1617	`` We 've got a contribution box ready , and every scout is privileged to drop in pennies and nickels that he has earned .
3.2083	No others accepted ; and no larger amount at one time from any boy desired .
16.4552	Have already enough to pay for two of the cans ; and hope to increase the order soon ! ''
10.9244	Cheers greeted this announcement .
908.6116	Others , who had heard about the good work being started by Numbers Seven and Eight of the Red Fox patrol , arose to announce that their mothers had promised to throw all sorts of opportunities for earning money in their way , if it was to be devoted to such a fine purpose .
1.5713	`` The Women 's Club is to bring this thing up at its next meeting .
150.2475	My mother says it shames them to know that the boys of the town are taking such a leading part in cleaning it up , '' said Bobolink , when he found an opening .
9.1588	`` Who 's next to report ? ''
92.9873	asked Jack , who had charge of this end of the meeting ; while the `` honorable secretary '' made notes , and filed away the various papers submitted .
20.0376	Immediately all eyes were turned toward Bobolink and Bluff , which team was known as Three and Four .
3.3271	Bluff started to rise , when a groan greeted him ; but he was not dismayed .
13.9796	`` Our r-r-report will be d-d-delivered b-b-by my c-c-confederate ! ''
8.6177	he simply said , and subsided with a grin , as though he thought he had hoodwinked his friends .
12.2248	Bobolink arose slowly .
13.6878	When he chose he could be very tantalizing ; though in an emergency none might excel him in speedy action .
44.7207	But when he had something to tell that he knew was being eagerly awaited , he liked to keep his chums in suspense just as long as he dared .
9.9846	Immediately all sounds died away .
615.8789	Every one seemed to know that Numbers Three and Four had been delegated to attempt an actual scouting trip that morning , into a hostile territory , so as to learn what progress a rival camp was making in the various degrees of efficiency .
94.3822	They had already heard about Manchester , and a few believed that they would have little difficulty in excelling that town when it came down to an actual test .
9.5808	With Aldine it was different .
28.6498	From all sources had come hints to the effect that the troop in that town was working most faithfully , with an eye on that coveted banner .
24.6952	And every scout in Paul 's patrol felt wild to know how much truth there might be in these reports .
8.7718	`` Hurry up , old molasses !
16.5491	Winter 's coming . ''
0.3640	`` Hit up the pace , wo n't you , please , Bobby ? ''
12.4893	Bobolink grinned .
7.7917	This was apparently just what he liked .
95.6846	When , however , he saw a restless movement among some of the more impatient , as though they were stooping down to gather chips to shy at him , he knew the time had come to open those sphinx-like lips , and speak .
1196.0829	`` Mr. Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , '' he began , when a roar interrupted him , so that he pretended to hastily remedy his error -- `` I mean just gentlemen ; I have the honor to report that your committee waited on the brothers of the Aldine troop , though unbeknown to their keenest scouts , and watched the entire operations at their called meeting this morning . ''
10.9768	`` Good !
11.6901	Fine !
7.6037	Keep it up , Old Leatherstocking ! ''
11.9350	`` We learned that they are working like mad to excel in all the arts that interest the scouting fraternity .
2.7037	Competitions were being run off in every branch of the woodcraft business .
294.7693	We saw fires started , camps made , trails followed , boats mended , fish flies tied , rods that had been made by single members ; we heard of all sorts of clever things that were being done in Aldine that would give the troop marks in the grand round-up .
350.8077	We listened to splendid speeches from the really efficient scout master , and our hearts warmed within us toward the gallant foe against whom we must soon be pitted ; just as our bones ached because we had to squat there high up in that tree over their camp , like a couple of roosting monkeys . ''
10.2032	`` Hear !
11.0430	hear !
10.7338	Bully for our monkeys !
6.1233	They 're all to the good ! ''
3.3710	shouted some of the more demonstrative boys , waving their hats wildly .
164.9093	Bobolink stopped to give a few melancholy dabs at his thighs , just as though they still ached from the long service in the tree ; while Bluff managed to emit a series of sympathetic groans .
99.9192	Then the orator took up his theme again ; and when Bobolink chose he could even run Wallace Carberry a warm race on the school rostrum .
30.2546	`` Some people might think that it was hardly fair in us to spy on our rivals ; but we are running our troop under strictly military rules .
18.2144	It 's always fair to try and find out what you are going to be up against when entering a competition .
109.6652	We are badly handicapped , because both of these other troops in the county have been working all summer ; and we 've got to come up from behind in our attempt to capture the prize .
4.9156	That 's right , is n't it , fellows ? ''
11.4864	`` Sure !
17.4956	We only want to know if they 're going to make a big fight ; or whether they expect to have a walk-over .
24.9618	Besides , I happen to know that there was a Bald Eagle from Aldine watching us work yesterday .
5.7361	He had a field glass , and was hidden where he could see all that went on . ''
45.8142	It was Jud Elderkin who made this astonishing declaration ; and what he said created quite a stir among the assembled scouts .
9.4853	`` All right .
8.3659	We did n't go there expecting to steal any of their thunder , fellows , '' said Bobolink .
5.1066	`` Of course not , '' asserted the nearest scouts .
4.8709	`` Well , how did you find it ? ''
20.7468	demanded William .
3.5758	`` I did n't see that they had anything on us .
415.1570	Of course they did lots of things better , because they 've had a heap more experience ; but there 's time between now and Thanksgiving for the scouts of the Stanhope troop to get a move on , and shake all rivals out of their boots .
11.9086	That 's all , '' and Bobolink made a sudden duck to get out of the lime-light .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
11.2310	Well done , Three and Four of the Red Fox patrol !
12.3097	Whenever we 've got any more climbing to do , we know where to get the monkeys ! ''
19.6143	cried William , with a mock bow in the direction of the blushing Bluff , and the grinning Bobolink .
1.4524	`` I congratulate the scouts on the way they carried out their mission .
13.4958	It was worthy of the annals of Cooper .
29.2450	May I ask how they learned just where the camp of the Aldine Troop was to be pitched ? ''
20.4206	asked Paul .
4.5135	Bluff was no longer to be repressed ; but sprang erect .
128.7326	`` I d-d-discovered that they always w-w-went to a p-p-particular p-p-place ; and w-w-when we s-s-saw that noble tree , why , we j-j-just l-l-looked at each other , and s-s-shook hands .
8.2664	Then we c-c-climbed up before the f-f-first eagle f-f-flew that way .
16.4053	T-t-thank you gentlemen f-f-for your k-k-kind attention . ''
9.2169	`` Wow !
6.9970	he got that in pat , all right .
1.6971	When Bluff makes up his mind to hustle he can beat the band .
14.3799	I move a vote of thanks to these most efficient scouts , '' said Wallace , pushing forward .
13.4398	They were given with a will ; after which other reports came to show what was being accomplished in numerous lines .
15.1459	The troop photographers produced their prints , which were passed around for examination , and brought forth an abundance of good words .
7.3524	To see themselves in the new suits of khaki made many a fellow 's heart thrill with pride .
524.2887	`` We must have a meeting every day up to the beginning of school , '' declared the acting scout master , finally ; `` for these busy Eagles have stolen a march on us while we slept ; and we 've just got to hustle now to catch up . ''
14.2705	`` But we 've got some mighty fine things to our credit already , and do n't you forget it , boys .
223.5438	I have n't heard of a horse being stopped , and a child 's life saved over in Aldine or Manchester , '' declared Wallace , with a proud glance toward Paul .
55.1110	`` Or any account of the rival troops attending a fire in a body , and working to beat the band until their new uniforms were next to ruined , '' spoke up Nuthin ' .
287.1281	`` I guess the boys of Manchester must feel pretty small when they listen to the story of how a Red Fox scout walked right into a burning building , and snatched up a baby that had been forgotten ; hey , how about that , fellers ? ''
21.1962	shouted William , pointing his finger at Jack .
6.8296	`` We 're hitting up the pace .
10.4389	We 're going strong , and bound to make things hustle right up to Thanksgiving Day !
0.3836	Every fellow do his level best to bring that banner home to Stanhope ! ''
29.2469	cried Jud Elderkin .
6.7592	`` We can do it ! ''
16.8833	yelled half a dozen in chorus .
7.2131	`` Why , its easy money , boys .
35.6170	Just organized , and not a second class scout in the troop yet , but look at what we 've done .
31.5735	Give us a little time , and we 're going to make the Beavers and Bald Eagles , and all the rest of 'em , sit up and take notice ! ''
11.6923	avowed Nuthin ' .
47.8335	`` And wait until you hear the inspiring sound of my bugle , which I expect to have at the next meeting , '' said Bobolink , proudly .
11.5937	`` Huh !
9.9357	that wo n't h-h-hold a c-c-candle to my d-d-drum ! ''
30.0507	declared Bluff , waving his arms wildly , as though he could already imagine the great fun in store when that instrument came to hand .
0.7175	And so the meeting broke up , with the scouts disbanding for the day .
3.4688	Some lingered to try once more the various stunts that interested them most .
40.6968	It seemed as if every fellow 's heart might be wrapped up in the desire to win that coveted trophy , and bring the banner to his home town .
1.7749	Strange to say there had not been a single mention of the other Stanhope organization .
25.5370	None of them believed that Ted and Ward would be able to make the least show in the competition .
5.2277	They knew the habits of these fellows only too well .
82.9769	As a rule , they never won , save through trickery ; and in the eyes of the committee appointed by the donor of the banner , anything that smacked of double dealing would be rigidly barred from the game .
0.6202	Paul and Jack , as usual , walked home together , arm in arm .
49.4158	As the recognized leaders in the movement that had so lately struck the boys of Stanhope , they must always have much to talk over .
3.8980	Besides that , they had their own personal affairs to discuss .
461.7059	`` Well , '' said Jack , finally , when they found that they were alone , the nearest comrades being far behind on the road ; `` the four coins are still there in the snug little box , Paul . ''
8.6813	His companion looked quickly at him .
6.0866	`` You carried out my suggestion then ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
9.2169	`` Yes .
13.4708	The door has been closed and locked all day .
6.7380	Even the window was shut down and fastened , '' replied Jack .
0.1977	`` That made the little den as tight as a drum , eh ? ''
11.0534	laughed his chum .
7.5402	`` I should say it did .
39.3494	If any one got in there to-day he would have to slip through the keyhole , '' came from Jack .
6.5657	`` Unless he happened to have a duplicate key , '' Paul went on , seriously .
0.4124	`` And since you found the four coins there that could hardly have happened .
12.2358	Sure you counted four , are you ? ''
12.9280	`` That 's positive , '' returned his companion ; `` but to tell the truth I did get a little scare .
21.2038	At first I counted only three . ''
9.1588	`` But you found the fourth all right , Jack ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.2189	yes , '' replied the other .
3.9452	`` It was gummed fast to the side of the box .
3.6247	I had to scrape it off before I put it back .
16.0867	But when do you mean to tell me what you know about this strange affair , Paul ? ''
6.8322	`` I guess to-morrow , '' answered his chum .
9.4944	`` Bully for you .
4.9894	I 'll be glad to get it off my mind .
0.4022	What do you want me to do , Paul , in the meantime ? ''
6.6993	`` Nothing , '' came the ready response .
0.2113	`` Shall I leave the den shut up as it is , then ? ''
20.7468	demanded Jack .
0.4905	`` Until I see you in the morning , yes , '' laughed Paul .
2.9073	`` Do n't be surprised if I pop in on you unexpectedly .
39.8863	Perhaps I may not want any one to see me go in your house , and so I might come by the back door . ''
5.4606	Jack looked at him in a whimsical way and shook his head .
2.6773	`` You 've got me guessing , all right , my boy , '' he declared .
7.4510	Paul instantly changed the subject , after a way he had .
3.7408	`` The boys are getting on fine in that water boiling test , are n't they ?
34.8996	Four had it in nine minutes , and Wallace beat his own record by nearly half a minute .
4.4930	That is going to be one thing Stanhope must excel in , '' he said .
154.4266	`` Yes , '' remarked Jack , falling in readily enough with his companion 's desire to `` talk shop , '' `` and those photographs could n't well be beaten .
12.3286	What a lot of new and interesting facts some of the trackers have dug out of the trails they followed .
10.5079	The papers read fine .
16.1566	Paul , I really begin to believe we 're going to make a strong bid for that banner . ''
157.4086	Paul did not reply , and on Jack turning his head to ascertain why , he found his chum staring at a red automobile that had just whizzed past !
12.7314	It had a khaki-colored top !
8.9679	`` What 's the matter with you , Paul ? ''
78.6549	Jack asked this question , for of course he could not understand why his chum should take such a deep interest in any automobile that passed them on the road .
1.6649	`` Did you happen to see inside that red car as it went by ? ''
14.8022	asked Paul , turning eagerly on his friend .
112.0320	`` Why , er -- yes , I did chance to be looking over your shoulders just then ; I was a little afraid the wheels might graze you , '' admitted Jack .
6.0757	`` Do you know the machine , then ? ''
7.2745	asked the other , in some suspense .
4.2193	`` Do n't believe I ever saw it before ; but then , what of that ?
4.9429	Do n't dozens pass along here every day , that come up from the city ?
49.7187	It 's common to see a strange car , even if it has got a khaki-colored top , instead of a plain black one .
17.4759	Hey , Paul !
9.7802	what ails you ? ''
20.7468	demanded Jack .
4.4598	`` It was n't Colonel Strange , was it ? ''
0.2261	asked the other ; for the gentleman mentioned happened to possess a red auto .
111.6609	`` Of course it was n't , because his car has a black top ; and besides , neither of the two men was the fat colonel , '' replied Jack , immediately .
19.0874	Paul had learned something already .
4.2454	`` Then there were two men in it , you say ? ''
0.2266	he went on , casually , as though much of his interest had abated .
2.5652	`` Yes , and one of them was staring at me to beat the band .
1.4583	Perhaps he has lost a boy , and thinks I look like him .
5.4604	Do n't let him kidnap me , will you , Paul ? ''
3.4448	went on Jack with pretended anxiety , as he clung to his companion 's arm .
4.9685	`` Say , look there , the car 's stopped .
6.0560	I believe they 're waiting for us ! ''
15.9279	declared Paul , in some excitement .
0.1504	`` Well , that 's what gave me such a scare , you see .
9.6250	That 's why I 'm shaking all over , Paul .
21.9354	But in union there is strength ; and I 'm going to hang on to you , if he tries to coax me to get aboard .
5.6397	I 'm not in the long lost class . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
4.8939	come along , and let 's see what they want .
0.3730	He 's leaning over the top now , and keeps beckoning to us . ''
17.2933	Paul started on a run .
53.3154	He could feel his heart beating very hard ; indeed it was strange , he thought , that his companion did not hear it pounding away , and make some sort of remark .
0.2445	The chance that he had been hoping for seemed to be within his grasp .
425.8387	Not only had he discovered a car that answered the description of the one mentioned by Mr. Pender ; but the occupants were plainly desirous of obtaining information of some sort , and had selected him and Jack as the ones most likely to give it .
4.7483	As he hurried on , he tried to control himself .
1.8258	It would never do to show more than natural curiosity in his actions .
145.8985	If these two men were the ones the gentleman stopping at Jack 's house wanted to find , they must be smart enough to read his secret , unless he took warning .
41.3465	No sooner had he come abreast of the car than looking up he found himself staring into the dark face of a man who had a cruel look about him .
14.3347	What thrilled Paul , however , was the fact that one of his eyes was undoubtedly artificial .
16.0470	He had guessed this fact when Jack stated that the party _ stared _ so at him .
85.3431	All doubt was gone now , and he understood that by the strangest of luck he had come upon the parties for whom Mr. Pender was searching .
3.0432	The official must have known that they were headed this way for some purpose or other .
8.1177	`` Live around here , bub ? ''
0.5491	asked the man with the glass eye , as he looked piercingly at Paul .
45.5421	`` Yes , sir ; in Stanhope , '' replied the boy , surprised himself to find how steady his voice turned out to be under the trying circumstances .
8.5574	`` How far ahead is that place ? ''
9.7995	continued the man .
7.0643	`` About half a mile , sir .
54.1497	You can see the steeple of the Methodist church after you turn that bend ahead , '' and Paul pointed with a steady finger .
11.5937	`` Huh !
6.0119	I wonder now if either of you happen to know a Mr. Solus Smithers ? ''
37.5797	and as he put the question the man shot a quick glance toward his companion ; at which the shorter party nodded his big head , and grinned approvingly .
17.5396	Paul turned to his chum .
89.1585	`` Say , Jack , is n't that the name of the man who took the old Grimes farm up at the milldam ? ''
4.0152	he asked , though he knew positively that it was so .
3.7633	`` Smithers -- why , yes , I reckon it is .
4.7675	Is he a tall man , with a hooked nose ; and does he dip snuff ? ''
20.9063	queried Jack , innocently enough .
7.2837	`` That 's Solus to a dot .
108.0771	You see , boys , he 's from North Caroliny , where even the wimmen use snuff , only they rub it on their teeth with a stick .
225.8385	Now , mebbe one of you boys would be so obligin ' as to direct us to the shortest way to where this old mill stands , '' continued the man with the bogus orb .
73.7881	`` I guess the quickest way to get there is to drive through Stanhope , and pick up the Deerfield road on the other side .
10.7938	It 's only a few miles off ; but the road turns lots of times to avoid the hills . ''
3.8904	Paul noted that the taller man seemed to invariably look to his companion for support .
14.2412	It was as though they worked in common , and neither wished to become responsible for action without the other 's assent .
22.0653	After an interchange of low words , which the boys did not catch , the spokesman once more turned around .
6.2536	He held a silver half dollar in his hand .
6.0972	`` Here 's something for your trouble , boys .
14.1678	But look here , ai n't there another way to get to that old abandoned mill without going through the town ?
36.0482	To tell you the truth we lost our number away back , and might get hauled up because we ca n't show a tag on the back of the car . ''
16.1890	Paul had already noticed this significant fact .
1.7200	It is the business of a scout to take note of even trifles .
303.2985	One of the tests of memory is to look in at a store window for just one full minute ; and then , going away , make out as complete a list of articles it contained as is possible .
22.3756	And still , he did not believe that this was the true reason these men disliked passing through Stanhope if it could be avoided .
50.0297	Perhaps they had some suspicion that Mr. Pender was visiting there ; and did not want to take chances of his meeting them face to face .
376.9758	`` Sure there is , '' broke in Jack , who saw no reason why he should not believe the artful excuse given ; for Jack did not know all his chum had learned about these parties ; `` after you pass the bend yonder , just turn to the left .
7.1176	You ca n't miss the road , for its got a big maple tree right at the junction .
81.9992	We call that the Grapevine Road , because it twists and turns so ; but it will fetch you out right at the old dam , mister . ''
57.1685	Many a time had Jack himself walked along that same winding path when coming home with a string of bass , taken in the mill pond .
271.5735	It was longer , to be sure , but there were some fine apple trees on the way ; and the walk through the dense woods was so much more enjoyable on a hot summer day than the open stretch that marked the other route .
46.2734	The man flipped the coin in the air , and as it fell at Paul 's feet he felt constrained to stoop and pick it up .
0.2329	To do anything else might have aroused the suspicions of the man who stared .
10.9404	And at the worst it meant another contribution toward the various funds which the boys were raising for many purposes .
1.8219	Boys as a rule have little objection about receiving `` tainted money . ''
94.7748	And while Paul understood that these men had been breaking some of the laws of the land , he was not supposed to know the particular way in which their money had been gained .
17.1733	`` Much obliged for the information , boys ; and please do n't report us in town as being short a license tag .
5.6429	We 'll get a new one just as quick as we can .
16.2117	So-long ! ''
66.6087	As the shorter fellow started the machine his companion waved his hand at the two chums on the road , both of whom of course returned the salute .
3.2167	Jack watched his friend out of the corner of his eye as they walked on .
3.6594	Perhaps he was entertaining a dim suspicion that Paul might be keeping something from him .
2.4559	But he asked no questions ; and the other volunteered no information .
72.0895	A scout is supposed to know when to hold his tongue , especially when in the company of his superior officer ; and so Jack let the matter drop .
196.9172	`` See , they 've turned in , all right , Paul , '' he said , as he pointed to the broad marks of heavy tires leaving the main road , and passing under the spreading maple that stood at the junction with the Grapevine .
1254.8222	`` That 's so , '' returned Paul , apparently not in the least interested ; and yet as they continued to walk briskly toward home he frequently turned a wistful look over his left shoulder , as in fancy his thoughts followed those two strangers up to the old farmhouse at the mill pond .
25.3161	Who was this Solus Smithers ?
13.3629	Could he be in league with these two men whom the Government expert was sent to watch ?
3.5883	Paul remembered that he had heard several people talking about the man and his ways .
34.3687	He seemed to have plenty of money , yet he made no effort to farm the place he had rented that summer .
52.3046	As soon as they reached town he started to accompany his chum home , hoping to have an opportunity to see Mr. Pender in secret .
463.6108	Catching sight of that gentleman walking down for the evening mail , he made some excuse and broke away from Jack ; who looked after him in bewilderment , grieved because Paul , for once , seemed to be keeping some secret from him .
15.8958	Mr. Pender presently came out of the post-office .
6.4898	He had a letter in his hand , and was apparently much displeased at what it had contained .
9.2303	`` Why , hello !
17.7898	Paul , my boy !
10.0731	Glad to see you .
10.1315	How is the patrol coming on ?
3.7227	Some day you must allow me to watch your manoeuvers up there in the woods .
10.9135	I 'm deeply interested in all such goings-on , you know , '' he said , shaking hands , heartily .
14.7998	`` Yes , sir ; I 'll ask the boys for permission to invite you , '' began Paul .
4.6132	`` Were you looking for me , my boy ? ''
23.8547	asked the other suddenly , his keen eyes having doubtless detected something in the manner of the young scout master that gave him his idea .
2.7137	`` Yes , sir , I was , '' replied the one addressed .
62.1135	`` I wonder now if , on the top of bad news from Washington , you could be about to bring me new hope .
7.6806	Have you learned anything you want to tell me , Paul ? ''
8.0085	`` I 've seen that red auto , and talked with the gentleman who has the glass eye ! ''
4.1782	said the boy , trying in vain to keep his eager voice from trembling with excitement .
94.1095	Mr. Pender swooped down and seized Paul 's hand , which he squeezed so heartily that he almost made the tears come to the boy 's eyes .
5.3831	`` That sounds good to me , my boy .
9.4305	Please tell me about it .
8.8913	Where was it at the time ?
11.7094	And do you think it can have gone beyond Stanhope ?
16.9995	I hope you did n't give the gentleman any idea that you had ever heard a word about him or his car ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
6.2857	I give you my word , sir , that they never dreamed I knew a thing about them .
14.2436	A scout has to learn how to keep his feelings in check , you see , Mr. Pender .
0.3890	I acted just as naturally as Jack did ; and he knew nothing . ''
6.5081	`` Well , tell me about it now , please . ''
21.1523	Stopping at the corner , Paul started in to relate all the incidents connected with that meeting on the road .
8.9309	The gentleman hung upon every word .
3.6390	He certainly looked pleased , and Paul realized that he had done something worth while .
45.7814	To his credit be it said that never once had he entertained the thought of receiving any sort of reward for his services .
1.2127	`` All this is of the greatest importance to me , my boy .
126.5212	I am frank to tell you that the successful capture of those two men you have so ably described , thanks to your scout training , will mean much to me .
26.4470	And depend upon it , if success rewards my efforts , I shall certainly remember that you gave me very valuable assistance in the undertaking . ''
9.8202	`` Then you think I might have a reward , do n't you , Mr. Pender ? ''
9.8387	he said .
87.5656	`` I most positively do , and right now and here I 'm willing to promise you -- '' `` Wait a little , Mr. Pender .
19.2427	There 's only one thing you could do to pay me for the little assistance I have been to you .
190.2457	Some time later on , after you get back to Washington , write me a letter on your official paper , stating just what aid the Boy Scouts of the Red Fox patrol were to you in furthering the ends of justice .
3.3262	That 's all any of us could accept , sir . ''
11.0807	`` By Jove !
17.0153	I 'm proud to know such boys , and proud to shake hands with the fine scout leader at their head ! ''
3.0912	exclaimed the Government representative , as he cordially thrust out his digits .
28.2221	But `` once bit , twice shy '' ; and Paul shook his head as he caressed his fingers .
19.7385	`` Excuse me , wo n't you , Mr. Pender ; but once at a time is enough .
8.6070	I expect to have a lot of use for my right hand to-night , sir , '' he laughed .
9.2169	`` Oh !
8.2980	pardon me , my dear boy ! ''
18.1648	cried the other , `` I was forgetting that it was n't the hand of a tiller of the soil I squeezed .
11.9076	I 'll be more careful next time .
25.8647	But your news was so unexpected , coming at a moment when I had received some depressing information by mail , that I quite forgot myself .
6.6856	Please continue to keep these facts to yourself for a little while longer , Paul . ''
21.6427	`` Yes , sir ; until you give me leave to speak I wo n't tell anybody , not even my own folks at home .
59.6467	And if we are so fortunate as to get that letter from you , Stanhope Troop will have a big advantage over other competitors .
181.1202	You know , sir , we are competing for an elegant banner ; and the other patrols have been working all summer ; so that we 've just got to get busy if we hope to have a show in . ''
95.4442	`` I do n't care if they 've been going along a year , I 'd be willing to wager that Stanhope will win the prize .
0.2289	That shows what faith I put in the leader of the Red Fox patrol .
7.2313	Nothing is going to ever hold you back .
69.9056	I can see the spirit glowing right now in your eyes , '' and Mr. Pender nodded his head wisely as he said this .
17.7863	Paul turned red under the praise .
11.3306	Mr. Pender was apparently anxious to know all he could about the place around the abandoned mill .
12.8578	`` Have you seen this party named Solus Smithers ? ''
2.9180	he asked , presently , as they walked slowly on in company .
7.2118	`` Yes , sir ; several times .
1.7041	He 's a very tall and thin man , with a face I never liked .
8.5627	He 's driven some of us boys away from the mill pond this last summer .
34.5067	We have always fished there , and nobody ever said a word ; but he acted as if he had an idea some of us would steal his old house .
4.7060	He even brought out a gun once , and warned three fellows off .
11.3571	After a while no one cared to go up there .
27.4253	Some of the boys even said they believed the old man was daffy , and that he might shoot if anybody made him real mad . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
2.9542	yes ; I see ; and he did n't want trespassers on his farm , eh ?
3.2990	Does the mill pond stand on the ground he 's rented ? ''
10.4913	asked the gentleman .
9.2169	`` Oh !
6.7004	yes , and all the ground around there .
73.9923	It must cover four hundred acres , but most of it is in woodland , you see , sir , '' replied Paul , promptly .
6.6350	`` Can you tell me what Smithers looks like , Paul ? ''
118.1966	`` He 's very tall , stoops quite a lot , uses snuff like they do down in North Carolina , and has small blue eyes and a queer nose .
1.5034	Some of the boys say it looks as if it had been broken .
13.4715	That man in the red car knew it when Jack called it a hooked nose , sir . ''
12.1489	Mr. Pender slapped his thigh as though in great glee .
4.9282	`` Well , this is great luck , sure enough .
34.2469	From your description I believe that I know this Mr. Solus Smithers , though that is n't his name at all .
3.7928	It keeps on getting better and better , the deeper I grub .
8.5323	And if all turns out well , I shall owe you a heavy debt , my dear boy . ''
4.6409	`` Make it up in that letter then , sir .
9.9871	The stronger the better .
3.3843	And if you happen to need any further assistance do n't hesitate to call on us .
152.4113	We 've got some dandy trackers in the Red Fox patrol ; and it would have to be a pretty smart fellow to pull the wool over their eyes , sir . ''
286.4949	`` Good for you , Paul , '' said the gentleman , warmly ; `` always ready to sound the trumpet for your comrades ; but if the truth were told I reckon I 'd find the scout leader at the top of the bunch when it came to a knowledge of woodcraft . ''
9.8435	`` Please do n't , sir , '' pleaded Paul .
1516.1413	`` Jack has been confiding to me all about how you 've always been deeply interested in outdoor life , '' went on Mr. Pender ; `` but as you have told me all you know about this red car that has gone along the Grapevine Road , headed for the old mill pond , I believe I 'll have to leave you .
11.5283	Take my hand , wo n't you , Paul ?
17.3000	I promise to be good , and not put on pressure , though my heart is very warm toward you , lad . ''
21.3743	So Mr. Pender hurried away .
20.3891	Paul turned back .
5.2195	He had noticed an air of unusual excitement inside the post-office , and his curiosity was stirred .
578.6126	While Mr. Pender and his strange mission was in the foreground , of course , he had been able to pay little attention to anything else ; but now that this was shelved he could not resist the inclination to return , and ask what made the people stand around in knots as though exchanging views .
589.3441	He discovered Ted Slavin and three of his friends jabbering away just inside the door , and heard one of them exclaim : `` Course we will go along ; it 'd be a big feather in our cap , fellers , if we 'd be the ones to bring him back . ''
0.3742	`` Yes , send out word for the boys to get together , Ted .
21.8790	We 'll show 'em what we fellers that has hunted since we was knee high , know about follerin ' a trail ! ''
10.3818	another remarked .
0.3303	`` Let up , you ; d'ye want to give the whole snap away ?
8.5192	See who 's here ! ''
18.7129	whispered Ted ; but in such a hoarse tone of voice that Paul could not help hearing .
7.8071	Of course his curiosity was still further aroused .
20.6044	Whatever could have happened in quiet Stanhope , to cause all this gathering of people , and such earnest consultations ?
36.9252	He saw Chief Billings , who was in charge of the police force in the town , leaving the post-office , and noted that a large delegation trailed after him .
43.6812	Could it be possible that the local authorities had in some manner become aware of the fact that law breakers were abroad in the land ?
15.5539	Was Mr. Jared Pender , the Government expert , about to have rivals in the field ?
658.4412	When those cronies of Ted spoke of following a trail could they have had any reference to the track of the wonderful red automobile with the khaki-colored top ; and occupied by the two parties whom Mr. Pender wished to catch , as he said , `` with the goods on ? ''
20.1648	Paul hoped not .
7.3359	It would complicate things very much ; and in the confusion the rascals might manage to slip away .
57.8525	Paul had known Chief Billings to undertake a clever piece of business before now ; but never succeed in accomplishing one .
2.9145	Some one banged into him as he turned a corner in the building .
9.2303	`` Why , hello !
15.5633	Paul , that you ? ''
10.0218	said a voice .
133.6760	It was Si Growdy , who claimed to be a nephew of old Peleg , but who had never been known to be recognized by the crusty old farmer .
140.7343	He clerked in one of the general stores , of which Stanhope boasted several big ones , where everything , from a package of pins to a coffin could be purchased .
5.1466	`` What 's all the row about , Si ? ''
553.9155	demanded the acting scout master , as he seized hold of the clerk , to head him off ; for Si seemed to be in a hurry as usual ; he worked for a man who was a driver , and had to give an account of every minute of his time .
10.0647	`` Ai n't you heard nawthin ' about it , Paul ?
23.3154	Where you ben all this afternoon ? ''
10.1552	was the way the clerk answered one question with another .
4.1275	`` Up in the woods with the scouts , doing stunts .
9.9768	But tell me what 's gone wrong ?
47.1621	Another robbery at the jewelry store ; or has some one sneaked away with one of the coffins your house carries ? ''
22.3296	pursued Paul .
25.8554	`` If anybody ever got off with a pin that did n't belong to 'em at our emporium , the fact ai n't never been known .
5.1563	I 've seen the boss chargin ' customers with the cracker they eat when samplin ' .
5.5067	We got orders to make light weight if they buy .
3.7253	But about this rumpus ; they 's a child lost ! ''
11.1094	said Si .
8.5006	`` Who 's child ? ''
19.6748	asked Paul , instantly deeply interested .
18.1149	`` Mr. Boggs ' little Willie .
5.6836	The Chief was just in to talk with him .
13.9049	He 's all broken up over it , because you know , he uses a crutch , and ca n't help hunt . ''
351.8203	Paul knew Mr. Boggs assisted the post-master in his duties ; and many a time had Paul chatted with the pretty little chap who played around the building while his father was assorting the incoming mails .
20.2592	Willie Boggs had always been a universal favorite .
2.7715	He was the sweetest child in all Stanhope , and everybody loved him .
16.2985	Paul was shocked at the news .
1.7605	Still , he hoped it might not be as bad as Si said .
9.7058	`` Where did it happen ?
10.5784	How do they know ?
11.8784	Who saw little Willie last ?
6.5049	What has been done to find him ? ''
3.0153	he fired at the clerk like the discharge of a Gatling gun .
11.1412	`` Glory !
248.6728	expect me to tell the hull story , with my boss asettin ' there inside the store , watchin ' the clock , an ' dockin ' me for every minute I 'm late ?
9.0841	All right , who cares ?
118.9858	And besides , Paul , p ` raps that troop of yours might be useful in follerin ' the tracks of poor little Willie , '' Si went on .
9.1299	`` Where , when , how ? ''
9.6036	demanded the scout master , resolutely .
8.1065	`` This mornin ' it happened .
56.0080	Willie went with Annie Spooner to get some leaf mould in the edge of the woods , for her ma 's flowers .
15.8969	She came back just at noon an ' sed Willie had strayed away in the woods . ''
13.6669	`` Did anybody go to look for Willie ? ''
20.4206	asked Paul .
11.8770	`` Three boys went out to bring him in .
1.5949	They hunted high an ' low , but he wa 'n' t there .
11.0552	Then a dozen people set out to search the woods .
9.1425	Just now they come back to say Willie ai n't to be found high nor low .
8.7602	That stirs the big chief some .
30.1576	He ` low he knows how the thing 's to be did ; and so he 's agoin ' to organize a hunt for the lost child .
8.5478	That 's all .
4.3310	Now , let me get back to my slave tasks , Paul . ''
786.0183	`` And night coming on , '' murmured Paul , as he looked out of the door to where people were assisting the crippled Mr. Boggs across the square in the direction of his nearby home , where his wife was no doubt waiting eagerly for some news of the missing darling .
519.5679	Si Growdy shot out of the door , and headed in the direction of the store where he gave his valuable services daily from seven in the morning until late in the evening , for a miserable pittance .
18.5241	Paul walked thoughtfully out of the post-office .
111.6469	He was tired from his exertions of the afternoon ; but all that was immediately forgotten when he mentally pictured the weeping mother in that little cottage where the honeysuckle climbed above the door .
107.5809	Then he thought of the terror of the little fellow , wandering about in the great woods with night coming down , and all sorts of strange noises arising to chill his blood .
7.2651	`` I 'll do it ! ''
3.1907	exclaimed Paul presently ; `` the chance is too good to be lost .
23.2049	Why let Ted and Ward have the inside track ?
47.5130	Just as soon as I can send word around we 'll test our new system of bringing a bunch of the Fox scouts together .
25.4845	And then , if the boys are willing , we 'll try and discover where Willie Boggs has wandered .
3.4731	It 's a glorious opportunity to find out if what we 've learned is worth having .
2.8417	Here goes then , to send out the call for help ! ''
4.7408	`` Why , Paul , what 's all this hurry mean ? ''
6.9894	`` I just want to get a few bites of supper , mother , and then rush off .
1.5230	I 've sent out the call for a hurry meeting of the patrol .
7.5922	Some people call it the emergency signal .
10.3049	Every one of the scouts knows what it means .
4.4425	Those who can get out will be gathering here inside of half an hour . ''
0.2053	`` But it must be something very unusual that urges you to do this .
142.5656	You 've been on the go all afternoon , and I do n't know that it is wise to bolt your supper in such a style , just to be ready to greet the boys when they arrive . ''
7.1760	`` Mother , you do n't understand .
0.6233	Father has n't come back from his afternoon round of visits , has he ?
7.3423	Then you could n't possibly know , '' went on Paul .
6.0169	`` Know -- what , my son ? ''
0.2463	questioned his mother , seeing that the boy was worked up more than usual .
5.7955	`` We 're going to organize a searching party .
0.2354	Perhaps some of the scouts may be smart enough to get on the track .
31.2256	It 's poor little Willie Boggs , mother . ''
24.5977	`` Searching party -- Willie Boggs !
11.3683	Is the child lost ? ''
2.8394	`` Yes , and has been ever since before noon , in the big woods .
10.2554	You see it 's just beginning to get dark now .
2.0348	Think of the poor little fellow wandering perhaps miles off in the woods .
7.1787	What if a storm should come up ? ''
13.6234	and Paul 's manner told how he felt .
1.5867	`` But there are no wild animals large enough to injure the child .
22.8289	The most he could suffer would be exposure to the night air ; that and the fright of finding himself alone .
9.9755	Oh !
9.3078	it is a terrible thing though ; and little Willie is all his poor father has left .
10.4658	It would kill him if anything happened , '' declared the good lady , whose heart was very tender .
9.4681	`` Now you see why I 'm in such a hurry to get a bite , mother .
0.6612	Every minute might count , for perhaps he is wandering further and further away .
20.3300	You 'll let Jane get me something in a jiffy , wo n't you , now ? ''
10.7038	continued the eager lad .
0.1899	`` Gladly , and help her too , after you have told me more .
6.3963	How do you boys expect to look for the child in the blackness of those woods ? ''
30.2298	`` Every scout will carry a lantern , with which we have practiced signal wig-wagging until we are able to send messages back and forth .
115.2835	Besides that , we can form a long line across the woods , and comb nearly every bit of it , looking into every stack of brush and waste to see if Willie has lain down .
17.0578	And mother , think if we should just find him , how glad you 'd be that we went out ! ''
8.4858	`` Indeed , I should !
6.0726	I shall pray that you succeed , my boy .
5.2497	And it does you great credit that you are so earnest in your desire to help others .
31.3523	Sit down , and I 'll wait on you myself , '' and Mrs. Morrison bustled away toward the kitchen as she spoke .
39.3766	As Paul was hastily devouring his supper , for he was as hungry as a wolf , who should come in but the doctor .
47.7936	And of course he had to be told ; though Paul 's mother took this task upon herself , giving the boy a chance to eat .
117.6624	Through the window Paul could see that already several fellows had gathered ; and other lanterns were meanwhile coming like giant fireflies through the gathering gloom of the night .
33.8948	The prospect of bringing his scout troop into action for such a good cause was particularly pleasing to the boy who temporarily filled the office of leader .
165.8538	Spurred to do their very best by a recollection of the vows they had so recently taken , the members of Stanhope Troop might be depended on to bring credit to their organization .
19.1016	By the time Paul issued from the house there were a full dozen of his chums present .
30.8613	He was glad to see that all the original charter members forming the Red Fox patrol were on hand .
17.8554	They happened to live closer than others who had joined later ; and boys of a particular community generally flock together .
14.5744	Immediately a great hubbub ensued .
32.7598	Those who did not know what all the fuss was about had to be `` put wise , '' as William said .
577.8398	And Paul was called upon to explain his plans for the tracking of little Willie Boggs , who had become as a chip on the torrent , a wanderer in that mysterious forest , the end of which few Stanhope fellows had ever reached in their wanderings up over the hills .
59.7611	There were now fourteen present , and Paul determined not to wait for any more of the troop to come to time .
16.9759	`` Fall in ! ''
1.9103	Down the street they marched , the lanterns flickering as they swung to and fro .
20.4436	No wonder people , rushing to the doors as shouts arose , began to ask eagerly if the lost child had been recovered .
3.8562	`` It 's the Boy Scouts ; and they 're going out to join the hunt ! ''
19.2117	some one shouted .
9.2169	`` Oh !
7.0252	they 're about a mile behind Ted and his crowd ! ''
1977.1181	jeered one fellow who must have had leanings toward the Slavin party ; he had been detected in cheating so often in every game boys played that for months now he found himself left severely alone by decent fellows , and it was reported had applied for admission to the patrol Ward and Ted were getting up .
31.9764	Out of the town , and straight to the spot where the lost boy had last been seen Paul led his squad .
128.7097	He knew that it would be only a miracle if the many feet that had trod the ground over would have left any trace of the child 's little shoes ; but he still had hopes that the training some of his scouts possessed would bring more or less success .
328.2659	The unique sight of all those lanterns on the road had attracted many people , so that when they arrived at the spot Paul had in mind , fully thirty followed , a number of them boys who came only to make sport of the scouts .
11.7702	`` Spread out , fellows , '' said the scout leader , quietly , `` and examine every foot of ground .
76.7460	If you find a single impression of Willie 's little shoe , give the signal , and I 'll come ; but hold your places every one . ''
15.4697	Immediately the scene became an animated one .
15.5378	Lanterns flashed hither and thither , swinging close to the ground ; while young eyes searched diligently for a trace .
71.7239	In less than five minutes the signal sounded , and Paul hurried over to the one who had given the same .
25.6416	Jack was at his elbow , and between them they examined the mark , to ascertain in what quarter it pointed .
5.5752	Then the advance was taken up in that direction .
2.1234	Again came the thrilling cry that told of a new footprint that had been found .
12.0141	This time it was Wallace Carberry who had made the discovery .
0.4715	He talked so intelligently about it that Paul determined to keep him close by .
33.3651	Wallace would be a valuable advisor in case he and Jack disagreed at any time as to what the signs meant .
17.2793	So they went on for an hour , finding a footprint now and then to encourage them .
66.6070	These came at more frequent intervals when they got far enough away to avoid the trampled soil where the crowd had hunted all the afternoon .
14.5647	Those who had followed were now missing .
9.5255	They had seen that the scouts meant business , and did not care to wander so far from town .
6.1351	Hence , Paul presently found that he and his patrol had the woods almost to themselves .
128.7162	Several times though he had seen other lanterns wandering around , and guessed that these were carried by some of the Slavin crowd , also diligently combing the woods in the hope of being the lucky ones to find the missing boy .
1.6229	The chief of police and his party had gone off in an altogether different direction .
7.7960	`` How long can we keep this up , Paul ? ''
23.3757	asked Jack , when they had been moving on for two hours , with no end in sight .
70.2768	`` Do n't know , but we ought to be able to put our best foot forward just as long as that little fellow does , do n't you think ? ''
13.0119	replied the other , reproachfully .
12.5672	`` Why , of course , and do n't think I 'm showing the white feather so early in the game .
0.2029	I 've made up my mind never to go back until he 's found .
0.2026	Why , we can camp right in the woods if it comes to it .
3.9973	And that would be a bully experience for every Fox in the bunch .
7.2194	Think of having to make beds out of branches !
1.7353	Ai n't I glad some of us brought our camp hatchets along . ''
213.8944	`` And Jack , it would leave us in a good position to take up the hunt again in the morning ; for you see we 'd be right on the ground where the little chap passed along .
8.9074	Suppose you call out again .
7.4285	He might hear , and answer . ''
9.1880	Jack obeyed , and repeated the name of Willie in a loud voice again and again .
6.3306	But only the echoes of the great woods answered .
21.9324	If the boy were within reach of that cheery hail he must be wrapped in the sleep of exhaustion , and unable to reply .
5.9444	Finally Jack ceased to call , for he was growing very husky .
26.7696	The search still went on with unabated zeal , each boy trying to vie with his mates in the endeavor to make some new discovery .
15.1879	Paul examined every faint print of that little foot , desirous of fixing the time it was made .
40.7981	Wallace joined him in this , and it was clearly shown that hours must have elapsed since the child passed that way .
2.7551	`` Still , he may be within fifty yards of where we are .
216.9172	Let 's keep at it as long as we can , and only camp when some are too tired to go on , '' declared Paul , greatly disappointed to think that they had thus far been baffled by hard luck .
127.6145	It was astonishing to see how far the little fellow had wandered ; but fear always lends wings to the feet ; and all the while Willie doubtless really believed he must be heading toward home .
0.4534	And Paul noted another fact that somehow gave him new interest in the enterprise .
64.6544	By degrees the trail had swung around to the left , as is nearly always the case when grown persons are lost ; and the principle seemed to hold good in the case of even a child .
199.3824	In itself this was not strange ; but Paul knew that if they kept on for another hour the chances were they would come upon the old mill pond , nestling in the valley .
353.9332	The fact caused him to remember his friend Mr. Pender ; to once more mentally see that red motor with the khaki-colored top ; and to picture the two strangers who had asked him so many questions .
133.4584	Was this really an accident , their being drawn out toward the farm of the unneighborly Sol Smithers ; or might it turn out to be the working of destiny ?
9.1059	He was aroused by a call that he had been expecting to hear for some time now .
2.9217	One of the scouts felt forced to admit that he was `` all in . ''
11.5665	They had done manly work to keep up the tramp all this time , being but boys at best .
87.7051	It meant that camp must be made , and the balance of the night spent there in the woods , waiting for day to come to renew their search .
53.6385	Poor little Willie was destined then to pass still more hours , surrounded by the terrors of the black and unknown forest .
40.6926	But probably by this time he must be so exhausted through his unusual exertions that he was dead to the world in sleep ; so it would not matter very much .
24.6268	Soon all was bustle as the fourteen lads began to make ready to spend a time in open camp .
20.5036	The sound of hatchets made pleasant music , as branches were cut , and beds made close to the fire that had been started .
12.9518	Some of the smaller lads were so utterly exhausted that they just dropped to the ground , and went to sleep .
89.5662	Paul and Jack passed around to see that these wornout fellows did not lie too near the blaze ; and that they were fairly comfortable .
72.6308	In an hour 's time it seemed as though every one were taking solid comfort after such rude fashion as could be devised .
250.7172	One of the boys had brought his camera along , keen to secure novel effects ; and without warning he set off a flash that gave him a picture of the slumbering heroes on their lowly beds , that would be ever afterwards treasured as invaluable .
141.5880	At the brilliant illumination several sat up , and one even gave a cry of alarm , thinking perhaps that lightning had struck a tree close by ; but with the coming of darkness again they settled back .
17.5898	But Paul could not sleep .
1.7148	He was only waiting until some of the more restless souls quieted down .
296.0166	Then he and Jack , together with Wallace , meant to again tackle the job of seeking for further imprints of those worn little shoes among the dead leaves , and in the soft soil under the giant trees .
33.9164	Somehow Paul believed that the hunt was bound to carry them to the very door of that farmhouse on the mill pond .
446.0354	He was induced to suspect this because the last time they had examined the small shoeprints , the mark of a much larger foot had appeared beside it ; and after mature deliberation he and Wallace came to the conclusion that some man , walking through the forest , had discovered the trail of the child , _ and was following it _ !
9.1352	He looked around him .
3.9349	As near as he could tell every one of the tired scouts was slumbering soundly .
36.7989	So Paul silently arose , touching Jack on the shoulder , who immediately gave Wallace Carberry the signal .
1371.0667	The three uttered no word , but moving softly back from the circle of firelight , carrying their almost exhausted lanterns , made ready to once more start out into the depths of the wood ; with the lonely farmhouse now rented by the surly Sol Smithers just half a mile further to the north !
10.8946	`` There it is again , Paul ! ''
1.4544	`` As sure as you live we 're being followed , boys ! ''
16.3471	and Wallace allowed his voice to rise just above a hoarse whisper when he made this energetic remark .
15.0893	The three were crouching in the bushes .
69.3210	As yet Paul had not caught a glimpse of the object which seemed to disturb both of his friends ; but he was looking sharply now .
7.7334	`` Why , yes , I do believe you are right , fellows , '' he said , calmly .
6.1559	`` Well , you take it mighty cool , I must say , '' declared Jack .
20.8274	`` Because I see no reason to get flurried over such a little thing , boys , '' was what the leader replied .
132.5085	`` Little thing , when you know Ted Slavin and a bunch of his toadies came up here to get all the glory they could out of this business !
103.9276	Do n't you understand , Paul , that if they thought they could down us , they 'd just as lief waylay us in the woods , and put an end to all our expectations ? ''
94.4300	This was a very unusual way of talking for Wallace , but it only went to show how the boy was worked up over the situation , and made nervous by the continuous strain .
51.5088	`` But how do you know those moving figures are Ted and Ward , or even any of that crowd ? ''
20.7468	demanded Paul .
237.0432	The others hesitated , and finally Jack remarked : `` Well , for a fact we do n't know ; but you remember we saw signs that even you declared proved what I 'm saying -- that some of those fellows have wandered as far as this . ''
6.0365	`` Yes , that 's a fact .
7.6916	I 'm not apt to forget it .
58.1378	Now , how many figures have you seen dodging along back there , just as if they did n't care to be seen -- yet ? ''
14.9208	`` How about it , Wallace ? ''
20.8666	queried Jack , doubtfully .
7.7507	`` Two , anyhow ; I 'm sure of that , '' came the hesitating reply .
3.7390	`` Yes , at least two , Paul , '' the other echoed .
14.0292	`` And we are three .
303.5391	That 's one reason why I do n't see any reason for getting nervous over the discovery , '' observed the leader , his voice now apparently showing a trace of humor that was bubbling up near the surface .
3.4206	`` But where there are two there may be more , Paul ? ''
21.0071	objected Jack .
4.2470	`` Yes , possibly eight or ten more , '' went on the calm leader .
11.2567	`` Goodness !
3.4637	and you say there is no need of our worrying ? ''
21.2871	exclaimed Wallace .
4.5946	`` Yes , explain what you mean , old fellow .
0.5497	Eight or ten would give us a warm time do n't you think ? ''
22.7333	demanded Wallace , gripping Paul 's arm fiercely .
78.2493	`` Hardly , if they were all sound asleep around a dying campfire , dead to the world , '' quoth Paul , chuckling now .
7.9501	But the others uttered low but vehement exclamations .
6.1487	`` Do n't you see what he means , Wallace ? ''
20.4206	asked Jack .
11.4864	`` Sure .
1.5409	What a couple of fools you and I were , '' came the scathing reply .
6.6511	`` We 've been followed by two of our own boys .
23.7071	They must have watched us crawl out of camp , and not wanting us to have all the fun , here they come creeping after us .
15.0397	What shall we do , Paul ? ''
10.4827	Jack queried in the other 's ear ; for the flitting figures were now very near .
19.4429	`` Open our arms and welcome the recruits .
8.1819	If they 're just bound to join forces with us , why should we make any kick .
7.5098	I 'm glad of it . ''
5.9135	Then raising his voice a little , Paul continued : `` Hey !
10.8462	there ! ''
8.0550	They could hear the murmur of voices .
33.3894	Evidently the two shadows were talking it over , and must have arrived at some quick conclusion , for presently same a hail .
9.2169	`` Hello !
24.1557	Paul , Jack ! ''
4.1159	`` It 's Bobolink , for one , '' muttered Jack , immediately .
5.7550	`` Then it 's a sure thing William is tagging along , '' said Wallace .
5.8944	`` Come on , both of you fellows .
9.7578	No danger ! ''
19.1283	called Paul , softly .
18.8089	After that assurance the shadows boldly advanced , and quickly joined the three who stood under the spreading oak .
41.2978	It proved just as Jack and Wallace had predicted , for the newcomers turned out to be William and Bobolink .
4.1452	They were chuckling , as though considering it a good joke .
10.1985	`` Thought you 'd give us the quiet sneak , and gobble all the glory yourselves , hey ? ''
9.9492	said the latter , as they bustled up ; `` but William and myself had it all fixed .
4.1813	We were on to your curves , all right . ''
112.5362	`` Yes , '' broke in William , just there ; `` did n't we see you with your heads together a lot , and was n't we wise to what was in the wind .
4.0586	Bobolink was awake , and it was my turn to snooze .
17.1840	He gave me a kick in the seventh rib that made me think a comet had dropped on me .
8.0203	But we showed up game .
16.7055	Now , what 's doing , fellows ; and do we get a grab at the scout ? ''
220.6939	`` If you both feel like trotting around a whole lot more , why you 're just as welcome as a shower in spring , '' asserted Paul , promptly .
62.4954	`` I should say , yes , '' declared Jack ; `` and if the whole bunch could stand the racket we would n't have crept away like we did .
32.8751	But most of the poor fellows are all in , and dead tired , and we thought it would be a shame to invite them to hike some more . ''
9.9651	`` Did you bring your glim along ? ''
20.4206	asked Paul .
10.0162	`` Our lanterns ?
7.0746	Well , William did n't want to , but I insisted .
78.4184	I knew that if we missed you fellows , and lost ourselves in the bush , they 'd come in mighty fine for company , '' returned Bobolink .
9.2707	`` Then let 's light up .
26.9140	After that we 'll spread out , and try to find the trail , '' with which remark Paul set the example .
20.0613	Presently five lanterns glowed like giant fireflies .
8.8624	`` Think it lies in this direction , Paul ? ''
20.4206	asked William .
7.3923	`` I 'm sure of it .
32.4642	After that man 's track came alongside the print of the little chap 's shoe , there was no more wandering about ; but it struck straight ahead .
3.6312	That told me the trail was heading for a house , '' came the ready reply .
9.3830	`` A house .
6.0575	Say , is there any other place up here but the old farm alongside the mill pond ?
4.5361	I do n't seem to remember any , '' remarked Bobolink .
16.2242	`` And that 's just where I expect we 'll bring up sooner or later , '' observed Paul .
2.4655	`` Then why not put for the old place at full speed right away ? ''
20.5569	suggested William , always impetuous .
2.5936	`` To do that we 'd have to drop the trail again .
28.5704	And besides , what does an hour , or even two of them , matter in the end ?
4.8445	Slow but sure is the successful scout 's motto , boys .
4.8306	Hello I look here , what 's this ? ''
12.2890	Paul thrust his lantern down close to the ground .
7.0984	Bending over to look , the others could see the plain impression of a child 's little shoe .
1.8363	It was heading due north , just as many similar tracks had been of late .
152.2827	`` Now if you look at this you 'll see it 's nearly crushed out by the big print of a man 's foot ; while just beyond the child has stepped into the impression made by the man .
406.7433	That can mean only one thing ; the two were going on in company , and for a minute he let go the little one 's hand , so that first the child was in front , and then behind . ''
12.6685	`` I guess you 're right , Paul .
6.3896	But see here , what does this mean ?
8.9530	The small track has dropped out altogether , '' remarked William .
94.8379	`` That is where the big fellow picks the boy up in his arms , and is carrying him , '' said Wallace , before Paul could answer .
4.4157	`` Right you are , that is just what happened .
1.6657	To tell the truth I do n't know why he did n't do that before .
5.0978	He must have been toting some bundle along , and could n't well carry the boy too .
9.1562	Come back a bit .
52.0597	I want to look around , '' and Paul retraced his steps until he had reached the spot where a confusion of tracks met his gaze .
3.0110	He followed the man 's trail a few paces , and found himself under a tree .
19.8812	Raising his lantern he carefully examined the bark of the trunk , and finding several fresh scratches , pursued his investigations still higher .
20.3570	One accommodating limb grew rather low .
38.9460	In fact a man could , by reaching up his arms , clasp it easily ; and that was what Paul believed had been done .
37.4910	`` Give me a push , somebody ; and then hand up my lantern , '' he said , clasping his arms about the tree as well as he was able .
357.8244	Ten seconds later William was handing him up the light ; after which Paul began to ascend slowly , looking about him as though constantly on the watch for signs that would tell another had preceded him .
7.0280	`` All right ; it 's here .
2.4811	I 'm coming down , fellows , '' he soon called out .
5.7500	Reaching that friendly lower limb he held something in view .
15.6034	`` Take hold of this , Bobolink , and handle it carefully , because we do n't know what 's in the package .
8.7375	It might be dynamite ! ''
10.3818	he remarked .
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.1374	I hope not ! ''
34.2086	exclaimed the one in whose arms the bundle reposed ; and he did not look any too happy at the prospect ahead .
3.5083	`` Do n't be silly , '' said Paul , as he dropped beside them .
4.0612	`` But whatever it may be , we might as well hide it in a new place .
20.5238	Then if the fellow should come back here to get it , he 's going to meet with a disappointment , that 's all . ''
5.7178	`` But what d'ye think it is ? ''
7.7207	argued the one who clasped the large package in his arms , though with evident reluctance .
10.8587	`` That is none of our business just now .
7.1358	It may be honest enough , and we 'd get into a peck of trouble if we peeked .
39.9228	So let 's just chuck it in some hollow stump as we go along , and muffle our trail behind us so he ca n't find where we put it .
18.7956	Later on I think I know some one who will be glad to look into what it contains . ''
69.3648	`` Perhaps I do too , '' remarked Jack ; and the two chums looked at each other , with mutual astonishment marked on their faces .
8.4583	`` Oh ! ''
10.9298	remarked Paul , `` are you on , too ?
7.8117	Did he tell you the secret ? ''
15.6698	`` I happened to pick up an envelope he dropped , and wondered whose it was ; so I went around , asking .
8.3548	He laughed when I came to him , and told me a little bit of news that surprised me .
2.7240	But Paul , he asked me not to breathe a word , even to you .
3.1181	That was a mean joke , when you knew all along , '' Jack complained .
5.3128	`` Remember the red car on the road , and the two men in it ? ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
4.3502	did they have anything to do with his coming up here ?
16.1725	Yes , now that I think of it , you were pretty much excited over that same red car .
8.0071	You guessed something then , did n't you , Paul ? ''
187.6205	`` He had asked me to watch out for a red car with a khaki-colored top , that might have two men in it , one of them owning to a glass eye . ''
10.0962	`` Good gracious ! ''
6.8991	said Jack ; `` that tall chap did have a bogus eye , for a fact .
47.4431	And when you left me in town you hurried around to the post-office to find Mr. Pender , did n't you ?
15.0512	I see it all now .
2.9790	He never came home for supper , as far as I know .
8.6555	I reckon he must have got a rig of some sort , and put out for the mill pond .
0.5279	But what about Solus Smithers -- they asked after him , you know ? ''
13.0113	Paul pointed to the marks on the ground .
5.7489	`` Unless I 'm wrong those are his tracks .
32.1157	I noticed that he had big feet at the time he came out and ordered us to clear away from the pond , and threatened us with his gun .
64.1318	Yes , perhaps he got home to find visitors waiting for him , '' Paul observed , just as though he could read all these things from the trail .
4.9751	`` Then we go on , do we ? ''
11.2885	asked Bobolink , eagerly .
295.0535	He had been listening to what passed between his two comrades , and while it was partly Greek to him , enough of the truth filtered through to give him a creepy sensation , as though cold water were being poured down his back .
76.6787	Bobolink was no coward though , and while he shivered it was more through a delicious frame of mind over the chance of an adventure than because he felt fear .
4.1903	`` Straight on , as long as these lanterns hold out .
9.7326	I see yours has begun to flicker already , William .
11.0569	There , it 's puffed out ; and my own is n't near as strong a light as it was . ''
203.0153	Paul seemed to be a true prophet , for inside of five minutes the lanterns `` gave up the ghost , '' the last to expire being that of Jack .
15.4385	`` What 's doing now ? ''
20.7468	demanded Jack .
5.4920	`` Gather up all the matches in the crowd .
6.7152	Then I 'll strike them one by one , '' was Paul 's immediate response .
7.7937	This emergency torch lasted for a little while .
6.6811	Finally the last match was gone , and still they were some distance away from the mill pond .
41.2389	`` Listen , '' said William , suddenly ; with a thrill in his voice ; `` whatever do you suppose that is ? ''
6.7136	`` Sure it was n't an owl ? ''
95.9053	asked Paul , when a full minute had passed away , without their hearing a repetition of the sound that had reached the ears of his comrade .
8.2033	`` Did n't sound like it .
4.3854	I kind of thought it was somebody calling for help ! ''
4.8732	said Bobolink , quivering with the suspense caused by the situation .
7.1516	They stood in a group , listening eagerly .
81.2235	The night wind stirred the tops of the tall forest trees softly , and even this gentle sound boomed on their strained nerves like the strokes of a bass drum .
9.2169	`` Oh !
11.4511	there !
6.2098	Did n't you hear it that time ? ''
12.4301	whispered Bobolink .
24.6943	`` I guess we did , '' replied Paul ; `` and you 're right in saying it is somebody shouting .
1.7178	But all the same I do n't feel sure it was a call for help .
12.2198	Let 's remember , fellows , that Ted and his crowd must be somewhere about up here .
38.9457	And you know from past experiences what dodges he 's up to when he wants to play a trick on anybody . ''
41.3174	`` Do you mean he 'd like to draw us off by shouting that way , while some of his fellows went along to the farmhouse , and got the lost boy ? ''
20.4206	asked William .
13.6882	`` That would be just like Ted .
35.1303	He 's as full of tricks as an egg is of meat , '' Jack took it upon himself to say at this juncture .
0.1683	`` Well , what are we going to do about it , boys ? ''
20.4206	asked Wallace .
35.4596	`` I leave it to Paul ; whatever he says ought to be good enough for me , '' replied Wallace .
3.4787	`` And me , '' came from the others without hesitation .
9.9912	`` Thanks , fellows .
4.0272	I hope that my plan will prove the best after all .
3.9397	But do n't blame me if I should make a mistake .
82.8488	Let 's head for the road , which I take it ought to be somewhere over yonder , '' remarked Paul , pointing through the darkness .
8.1517	`` The road , eh ?
27.1731	I see , you mean that once we get on that we 'll have it easy all the way to the pond .
8.7596	That suits me all right .
17.8153	Count William in . ''
56.5659	`` Yes , seeing that our lanterns are out , and not a match in the crowd , I guess the sooner we get our feet planted on the highway , the better for our noses .
45.1753	I 've barked mine already against a tree , and another dose will spoil my classic beauty , '' grunted Bobolink , rubbing tenderly at the spot in question .
6.1365	`` Then come along , the rest of you , '' said Paul , starting off .
0.3711	`` Seems to me it 's getting lighter , '' announced Wallace , presently .
3.7225	`` Mebbe our eyes are used to it , that 's what , '' Bobolink remarked .
98.9291	`` Mine are closing up right fast , I warn you , fellers , '' said William ; `` and before long it 's going to be a case of the blind leading the blind .
7.5027	That branch took me across the face .
9.9755	Hey !
8.1788	ai n't that the same old shout ? ''
374.5299	`` Sounds like it ; but much nearer , '' returned Paul , with a vein of uncertainty in his voice , as if he might be commencing to doubt whether they were doing the right thing in paying no attention to the calls .
9.2169	`` Oh !
28.4309	I guess I know what it means , '' remarked Jack ; `` I 've been trying to make it out all along .
8.9598	That 's sure a different voice .
12.8275	Some of Ted 's crowd have got separated , and they 're just trying to get together again .
4.3337	You 've heard quail calling , after being flushed and scattered .
18.3287	How , Paul ? ''
11.9644	`` Perhaps you 've struck it , Jack .
20.3127	Anyway , we are on the road here , and had better push straight along to the pond first . ''
562.6119	`` Right enough , '' uttered Bobolink , as he broke through a cordon of brush , and jumped out on the highway , though it might be only an apology for a road after all , being scantily used ; `` and after that experience it 's going to be something big that drags me into the woods again . ''
108.2776	The little group stood there for a minute to recover their wind , which had been more or less exhausted in the last desperate push through the dark woods .
8.8928	`` Ready to move on , fellows ? ''
66.2172	demanded Paul , who had apparently not changed his mind , and was more than ever bent on covering the last lap lying between themselves and the pond .
0.6159	Jack and Wallace fell in on either side , and the march was begun .
17.9753	Since the other pair did not wish to be left behind , they were forced to accompany themselves to the movements of the trio .
72.7818	Thus they walked perhaps a full hundred yards along the winding road , with the stars showing overhead , and the black mysterious woods flanking them on either side .
19.9154	The shouts had apparently ceased ; at least none had been heard since the five lads reached open territory .
4.2614	Again it was Bobolink who caught a sound of some sort .
1.6778	`` Tell me again I 'm hearing owls , will you , fellows ?
16.8685	If that ai n't a gasoline wagon climbing a hill ahead there I 'm off my guess , '' he whispered .
10.7493	`` Chug !
10.7493	chug ! ''
18.6565	came the plain sound , as the air current veered more toward the point toward which they were heading .
40.7304	`` I know that hill , '' Paul observed , as if talking to himself ; `` it 's just this side of the mill pond .
6.6136	That means the car is coming this way .
5.6166	The two gentlemen are separating themselves from their dear friend , Solus Smithers .
10.2026	Why , I wonder ?
13.5053	Would Mr. Pender have anything to do with it ? ''
9.2169	`` Wow !
9.4056	did you see that ? ''
11.8848	gasped Bobolink , proving that his plaint about his eyes closing up could hardly be based on solid ground .
5.0327	`` Somebody struck a match , and it went out !
2.7485	Whoever it is , he 's on the road just ahead of us , fellows ! ''
21.3842	whispered Jack .
9.6396	`` Back up into the scrub here .
12.0412	Quick !
6.6376	for perhaps he 's got another match ! ''
10.0725	said Paul , following up his words by instant action .
37.9911	They managed to cower down in the brush , though Bobolink muttered something to the effect that he had received another jab in the neighborhood of his wretched eyes .
10.1437	`` Look !
0.3259	he 's done it , Paul , just as you said he would ! ''
21.3842	whispered Jack .
0.1977	`` Yes , he 's shielding it from the breeze till it gets strong .
3.3591	There -- well , what d'ye think of that , fellers ? ''
21.5696	gasped William .
8.1245	`` It 's Ted ! ''
31.0434	muttered Wallace , staring hard at the figure that seemed to be huddled up on the road a little distance away .
0.2536	`` What do you suppose the silly goose is doing on his knees ? ''
19.0344	came from Jack .
2.2101	`` He 's found something , and he 's looking at it .
8.2817	See , now he 's managed to open it up .
9.4091	Seems to me like a leather bag , boys , '' Wallace managed to wedge in with .
5.9855	`` Just what it is , old cat eyes .
10.8626	A hand bag !
0.4425	Now , however did that thing happen to be lying there in the road ?
31.3391	Nobody ever comes up here but Solus , and he is n't the one to own a bag like that . ''
0.6724	`` The red car , '' said Paul , as Jack seemed to hesitate .
4.6194	`` That 's it , as sure as you live .
6.1651	Dropped out of the machine ; and by jinks !
5.3871	the fellers are comin ' back to look for it .
8.0128	Never missed it till Sol got home ! ''
10.6752	his chum declared .
6.4046	All this talk between the five boy scouts was carried on in the lowest of whispers .
43.8384	The sound of their voices would not have carried twenty feet ; and the kneeling Ted was several times that distance away .
48.3852	Besides , he seemed to be so fascinated by what he had discovered in the leather grip that he had eyes and ears for nothing else just then .
7.3315	`` The motor is coming closer ! ''
6.7137	remarked Wallace , as the sound of the engine was borne more distinctly to their ears .
11.4864	`` Sure .
3.7368	She 's just at the top of the rise , and now it 's down-grade .
21.2895	Reckon she 'll be here in a minute .
9.1866	Push back further , fellows . ''
10.1437	`` Look !
26.2125	Ted hears it now !
8.7266	He 's jumped up !
24.5216	Seems like he just do n't know what to do , cut and run with the bag , or wait till the car gets there .
9.9755	Hey !
8.5778	watch that , will you ? ''
21.5696	gasped William .
0.2158	`` He threw the bag as far as he could into the woods ! ''
19.8725	said Jack .
143.3925	`` That looks like he meant to try and keep it , '' suggested Jack ; `` I imagine that the leather grip holds something that took Ted 's fancy .
3.1598	But all the same I reckon it is n't going to be easy sledding for him .
9.0890	Will he run , fellows ? ''
0.3681	`` He 's debating that same question now ; but it 's too late .
518.7934	He waited just half a minute too long , '' Paul remarked , as a sudden flash of dazzling light shot around a bend a short distance ahead , and the red car with the khaki-colored top came into view , making fairly fast time .
26.2069	They could dimly see the inmates apparently surveying the road ahead with the utmost eagerness , as though anxious to make a discovery .
4.6947	The loss of that bag must have rather upset their plans , and given them a jolt .
57.5785	Every one of the five hidden scouts crouched low , so that their faces might not be discovered by that fierce white glow .
48.1445	Plainly to their ears was borne the shouts of the men in the machine , as they discovered the figure of Ted on the road .
49.3482	The Stanhope bully had evidently made up his mind that the bag was well worth struggling for , and that he must make some sort of a fight to retain possession of it .
9.9365	Paul could guess what his plan of operations would be .
50.5491	He had seen Ted play innocent more than once before , when caught in the act of doing some mean thing .
1.5214	And as a rule the fellow could carry out the game fairly well .
62.7366	But he was up against a different proposition now ; and these keen-eyed men were not apt to be hoodwinked so easily as a parcel of schoolboys .
0.4653	Ted stood there , looking at the car that was bearing down upon him .
17.3617	No doubt he had assumed the innocent air of a rustic , and tried to make himself appear as stupid as he could .
67.6186	The two men in the red car were no longer calling , for they had seen that the boy on the road showed no signs of wanting to run .
45.9772	As they bore down upon the spot the car slowed up , and came to a full stop within a few yards of the waiting Ted .
13.8260	Every scout lying in the screen of bushes held his breath as he listened to catch what was going to follow .
6.9435	`` Say , gim me a ride , mister ? ''
4.9371	That was Ted speaking , before either of the men could say the first word .
30.8278	Indeed they were too busy clambering out of the car to surround him , and cut off any chance of escape , to think of anything else .
70.1470	Without answering they bore down on Ted , and he found himself confronted by two eager faces , while a rough hand clutched his arm .
9.2250	`` He ai n't got it , Brad ! ''
3.8336	exclaimed the shorter of the pair , as though disappointed over something .
2.1011	`` Hey , what 'd you do with it , son ? ''
4.1784	demanded the taller traveler , looking furiously at Ted , though pretending to speak gently .
8.2100	`` With what , boss ?
2.9667	I ai n't got nothin ' that belongs to you , sure I ai n't ! ''
23.1602	whimpered the boy ; and Paul came near to chuckling at the way Ted put on the agony .
5.2464	`` We lost a leather bag out of the car .
3.9336	I saw it after we turned into this here twisting side road just back a piece .
6.2077	We 've looked over every foot between here and the mill pond , and ai n't seen it .
4.9466	I 'm going to ask you again , son , what did you do with it ? ''
90.6287	The man did not threaten , as yet , but there was something deep down in his voice that seemed to tell of all sorts of terrible things that might happen to the boy unless he came to time , and confessed .
13.6610	But at any rate Ted was game .
43.2966	His covetous nature had been aroused by something he had glimpsed inside of that same bag ; and he did not mean to give it up unless pushed to the last resort .
85.3792	`` Ai n't seen no bag , mister , ` deed an ' I ai n't , '' he whimpered ; `` I got a lantern here , an ' I was ahuntin ' a little boy that was lost from home .
6.0716	Lots of other fellers in the woods adoin ' that same .
8.1974	But my light give out .
9.1093	Then I struck this here road .
26.0876	I 'm clean tired out , mister , and I 'd like to get a ride home , if so be you 're goin ' my way .
10.1714	A bag , mister ?
5.6065	Sure I ai n't knowin ' nawthin ' about no bag .
9.1618	Cross my heart if I do .
8.7579	Gim me a ride to Stanhope , mister , please ! ''
14.0100	The two men looked at each other .
11.0705	Apparently they hardly knew whether to believe Ted or not .
3.6996	Paul saw them put their heads close together , as though exchanging confidences .
158.5720	Then the tall fellow once more whirled on Ted , who had been standing on one leg , with a most forlorn look upon his face .
1200.1904	`` We both think that you lie , son , '' said the man who was minus one of his optics , as he thrust his face close down to that of Ted , as though he would look straight into his heart ; but this was something that no one else had ever succeeded in doing , and the attempt did not prove very successful .
80.6007	`` Tell him who we are , Brad , '' growled the shorter of the twain , who looked angry enough to devour the unfortunate Ted .
77.6030	So the one called Brad took something out of his coat pocket that made a peculiar jingling noise , and held it up before the boy .
8.3758	`` D'ye see them , son ?
2.9951	We call 'em bracelets , and they 're meant to go on the wrists of criminals .
22.5070	D'ye understand now ?
1.4941	We 're officers of the law , and we 've just made a grand haul .
4.5884	But some of the evidence has slipped away from us .
1.5478	It 's in that same bag you picked up on this here road .
44.5339	Now , do n't you dare deny it again , or we 'll take you into town with these pretty toys clasped on your wrists .
1.3529	I 'm going to give you another chance to tell us , son .
8.5522	Where did you put that bag ? ''
20.7188	Ted winced and whined .
7.1302	He showed all the signs of injured innocence .
21.6445	Surely he must have made up his mind quickly that the contents of the bag were well worth taking all sorts of chances for .
8.7568	`` Ai n't seen no bag .
6.8260	Sure I 'd be on ' y too glad to tell you , mister , if I had .
5.5850	All I wants to do is to go home .
16.8173	I 'm tired , an ' nigh sick with all this huntin ' for that kid , '' he whimpered .
34.1457	The man suddenly pounced on him , and despite Ted 's struggles and entreaties , he seemed to succeed in accomplishing his purpose .
260.9004	At any rate the concealed scouts heard a snap ; and when Ted reeled back he was holding his two hands close together in a suspicious way , and staring at something that seemed to be in the nature of a connecting link .
253.6593	`` Now you are in for it , '' said the tall man , shaking his head threateningly as he stood over the prisoner ; `` we 'll have to take you to town , and put you in the lockup as an accessory after the fact .
8.9163	D'ye hear that , you young fool ?
4.2107	And all because you refuse to help honest officers of the law in their legitimate business .
0.7478	Why , you may get ten years at hard labor , yes , twenty .
0.2203	Better tell all you know , and perhaps we 'll let you off . ''
22.6995	`` You can do anything you like to me , mister , but I ai n't agoin ' to say what I do n't know .
6.6160	Ai n't seen any bag of no kind .
9.0271	Cross my heart if I have .
10.0114	I 'm willin ' to help you hunt for it , even if I am dog tired .
7.3822	Do n't you believe me , mister ?
6.7102	Sure , I would n't lie to you .
5.1723	What would I be wantin ' with a bag ; we got plenty at my house .
11.4420	Ted Slavin 's my name , and I live in Stanhope .
8.4469	Gim me a ride , mister , if you 're goin ' that way , wo n't you ? ''
25.4131	Again the two men talked together , while Ted watched them out of the corner of his eye .
20.3765	He might even have tried to run but the fact that his hands were fastened together with that steel chain prevented such a thing .
36.7341	Once more they turned upon him , and the tall man pointing down , thundered : `` You 've been kneeling in the dirt ! ''
12.5747	Ted glanced down at his trousers involuntarily ; but even then he was not taken off his guard .
4.1611	`` I fell ever so many times after my lantern went out .
1.8058	See here , mister , how I scraped the skin off my hand .
3.7158	That 's the honest truth I 'm givin ' you ! ''
10.4282	he cried .
1.5238	Undoubtedly it was , but all the same the men showed no signs of yielding .
32.8502	The taller one , called Brad by his companion , deliberately detached one of the lamps from the car .
6.3489	With this he bent down to examine the road .
4.6383	`` He 'll see the marks of the bag ! ''
20.8971	whispered Bobolink to Paul .
184.9087	`` Watch him while I scurry along the road a bit , to see if he left it , '' was what the man said , and then moved down toward the spot where the five boys lay in hiding .
21.6798	When he came opposite them they hardly dared to breathe , lest his keen ears catch the sound , and he pounce upon them .
17.2482	But he went past , scouring the road closely , and looking for some sign of the missing bag .
3.6946	They saw him pass on , and the light grew dim .
6.8982	Meanwhile Ted sat down on a log , and seemed to be very dejected and forlorn .
113.3305	Once or twice when the shorter man was not looking Paul saw him glance around , as though sizing up the chances for a sudden plunge into the forest .
110.3681	`` He 's coming again , '' said Bobolink ; and the brilliant glow from down the road bore evidence of the truth of this remark which was whispered in Paul 's ear .
36.7460	Brad walked hastily back , and soon rejoined his companion , with whom he talked earnestly for a minute .
8.3800	`` Get up ! ''
44.1071	he said , turning to Ted , and giving the boy a kick that made him climb to his feet hurriedly , groaning with pain .
5.1689	`` Bring him along into the woods , Wash ! ''
8.5098	the tall man continued , turning aside .
9.2169	`` Oh !
6.6388	what are you goin ' to do ? ''
44.2523	cried Ted , in real or pretended terror , as he caught hold of the man 's coat , and sought to hold him back .
6.1986	`` You 'll find out right soon , son .
13.8146	Before we 're done with you perhaps you 'll wish you 'd told us about that ere bag us the beginning .
0.2214	We 're just going to make it warm for a feller of your size .
148.4737	This night air has made you too cold to speak up ; but we 'll fix all that , I reckon ; we know how to do it , do n't we , Wash ? ''
8.8740	`` Do we ?
7.7784	Well , I should smile we did .
1.4214	But they 's no need of our goin ' far , old man .
0.2281	This here is a right smart tree , and looks like it might answer .
8.8938	` Sides , they seems to be lots o ' loose wood lyin ' ` bout this part ! ''
15.8924	Paul felt a chill pass over him .
62.9402	Could it be possible these rascals meant to torture Ted until he told ; or were they just trying to frighten him ?
6.2713	If it came to the worst they just could not stand by and see such a thing done .
10.4614	Ted , of course , was considerably worked up when he heard what the shorter fellow said .
4.5770	It was so very plain he could not mistake the meaning .
63.8115	`` Say , mister , you would n't go to hurt a poor feller what never done you no harm , now , would you ?
14.8890	Wish I on ' y knowed where I could find a bag ; I 'd get it for you like hot cakes .
10.0542	Please do n't smoke me .
2.7844	I ai n't a ham , mister , an ' I never done you any harm .
8.0755	Let me go , wo n't you ?
3.0119	I 'll never come up here again , sure I wo n't .
3.0063	And I 'll promise to bring you all the bags in our house , mister . ''
10.3687	Paying no attention to his pleadings and his groanings the men stood Ted up against a tree .
4.5486	Then the rope brought from the car was wrapped around both boy and tree several times .
3.1992	`` Get busy , Wash , and scrape up all the dead leaves you can find .
6.3045	Then begin and pile up some brush and stuff .
9.9755	Oh !
63.4398	yes , it 's a cold night , but we ai n't agoin ' to let a poor critter what 's lost his way , suffer .
10.4326	Here you , stop that snifflin ' .
7.0388	Time enough to beller after it begins to hurt . ''
5.9055	He struck Ted again in the face , making his nose bleed .
3.0965	Paul had crept out from the brush and commenced to approach the spot .
3.2805	He knew that the other four scouts were probably close on his heels .
4.5828	Every boy 's heart beat like a trip hammer with excitement .
7.1919	They bit their lower lips to keep from shouting out loud , such was the strain upon them .
10.2906	But not one had the least thought of turning back .
6.9300	With such a leader , how could they ?
48.1359	The shorter ruffian was scratching right merrily among the dead leaves , making all the noise he could , so as to impress the prisoner with a sense of his perilous condition .
28.3839	While he worked he kept talking , half to himself , and no doubt uttering all sorts of terrible threats calculated further to alarm the boy .
3.2014	`` We forgot one thing , Wash , '' said the other man , suddenly .
10.0560	`` What was that ? ''
15.9944	asked the one on his knees .
9.6478	`` To search the varmint .
27.2826	I might as well do it right now , while you go on getting his jacket warmer ready . ''
65.5108	At first Ted tried to make all the resistance possible ; but this only brought quick punishment in the shape of ugly blows and threats .
2.8153	So Ted had to stand and allow the other to have his way .
24.9249	A minute later the man uttered a loud cry .
6.8622	`` Look here , Wash , what did I say ? ''
9.2206	He was holding something up .
34.7759	Seen in the light from the lamp belonging to the red car it looked very much like a fat wad of greenbacks , tied together with a cord .
0.2285	Wash sprang up , and bent over to examine the object in the light .
10.8648	Then he laughed harshly .
8.6887	`` It 's the boodle , all right , Brad .
7.4955	He found the bag , sure as thunder !
16.8393	And now he 's _ got _ to tell , or it 's all up with him ! ''
7.7993	Both men turned furiously on the bound boy .
114.7941	Ted had held out against all odds up to this critical point ; but of course he must admit himself beaten , now that they had found the evidence in his pocket .
7.7284	Nearer crept Paul , with his chums tagging close at his heels .
31.7056	And nobody thought to look beyond the line of brilliant light cast by the lamp which rested on the ground at the foot of the tree .
12.1444	Fortunately its powerful rays were directed away from the quarter occupied by the creeping Boy Scouts .
28.4395	`` Now , I reckon you 're agoin ' to tell all you know about that ere bag , son ? ''
14.9415	said Brad , in a terrible voice .
5.9364	`` I guess I 'll have to , mister .
3.1841	I was just holdin ' out to see if so be you was what you says .
36.1734	Now I know you be , and I 'm ready to tell the hull thing if you 'll only let me go free .
3.4787	I do n't want to be smoked , just yet anyway , '' Ted whined .
5.2157	`` You did find the bag , then ? ''
9.9486	demanded the other .
4.9455	`` Yep , that 's what I did . ''
3.5797	`` And took this wad of dough out of it ? ''
9.4184	pursued the other , savagely .
1.7816	`` It looked too nice to throw away , so I cabbaged it , mister .
16.4847	Wisht I had n't now . ''
53.1144	`` What became of the bag after you took this out -- go on , now , and tell , or -- '' `` Oh !
0.2792	I throwed that away , mister , right over here in the woods somewhere .
5.3444	If you look around you 'll find her close by .
5.0528	Please let me go when you dig her out ! ''
18.7679	said Ted , really alarmed now for his safety .
16.5112	Paul knew where that bag was .
0.2256	By the strangest chance in the world he was kneeling alongside it just then .
140.3170	In creeping forward so as to draw closer to the scene of action , and avoid the rays of light cast by the car lamp , he had happened to put his hand on some object that felt soft to the touch ; and he guessed what it must be .
4.6086	What if the tall man came straight toward that spot , looking for the missing object ?
13.5738	Dared they rise up and defy these two scoundrels ?
32.2992	If some one cast Ted loose would he join forces with them , and make common cause against the ruffians ?
47.4694	Judging from what he knew about the fellow , from past experiences , Paul thought no dependence could be placed on Ted .
137.7971	As likely as not if his hands were free , he would seize the very first chance to snatch up the bag and scamper off , leaving the others to bear the brunt of the men 's anger .
1.7415	But perhaps they would not have to face the tall chap just yet .
14.4461	He seemed ready to start into the bushes across the way first , taking the lamp with him .
11.9004	`` Keep on piling up the trash , Wash. .
9.6962	Get him surrounded good and plenty .
20.3305	For if we do n't run across that bag mighty soon we 're bound to make it warm for this Smart Aleck .
1.6238	But do n't put a match to the heap till I get back .
7.7037	I wanter see the fun , you understand . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
5.0580	mister , it 's just like I was tellin ' you .
15.8454	I stood in the road and guv the bag a throw when I see your light over the top of the hill .
0.6181	She jest _ must _ be close around here somewhere , '' Ted wailed .
229.3732	`` If Brad finds her , all well an ' good ; but if he do n't -- well , you 'll have a sweet time soon , that 's all , '' growled the shorter man , still on his knees , and engaged in scraping more leaves together .
24.6226	`` If you on ' y would let me , I 'd stand on the road jest where I was when I throwed the old bag .
11.2250	Then you could figger where she landed .
6.8200	Let me loose , wo n't you , mister ?
3.5568	I told you the truth this time ; and you 're sure to find that bag .
4.0453	They 'll be wonderin ' what 's become of me at home , sure they will .
1.3082	I got a mother , and she thinks a heap of me , she does .
3.3255	You would n't break her heart , mister , by smokin ' a poor boy ? ''
9.2169	`` Aw !
14.7802	dry up !
2.4645	you fooled us once , but you ca n't do it no more .
4.2093	It 's the bag , or your hide gets a singein ' , my fine feller .
11.5181	That 'll do for you , now . ''
19.6421	The man had a temper as short as his stature ; and Ted dared not stir him up any further .
7.6911	So he hung there alongside the tree , watching the glow of the lamp further up the road .
38.5345	And as he stood in this disconsolate position , he suddenly became aware that something was taking place just beyond the kneeling Wash. .
709.7218	Perhaps , had his hands not been so snugly fastened together with that horrid steel chain , Ted might have tried to rub his eyes , under the impression that they were deceiving him ; for he saw a face in the dim light , a face that looked wonderfully like that of Paul Morrison .
26.4873	Some foolish boys would have been so thrilled by the prospect of relief that they must have called out , and thus betrayed the creeping rescuers .
14.5592	Ted chanced to be built on different lines .
3.8925	He stared and blinked , but gave utterance to no sound .
3.1341	He saw other moving figures close on the heels of the leader .
20.7989	Then he understood that Paul was not alone , but some of his Red Fox patrol must be in attendance .
10.6471	Closer still crept the newcomers .
444.7379	If Ted 's heart ever warmed toward a living being it surely ought just then ; when these lads , whom he was wont to regard as his bitter rivals , and enemies in everything at school , took such chances simply because they could not see a Stanhope boy in trouble .
7.3001	Wash kept muttering to himself as he worked .
469.0399	The rustle of the leaves , and the crackling of the brush as he dragged it forward , kept him from hearing such sounds as might have been made by the tenderfeet scouts , who had not yet learned just how to do these things as might an Indian or an experienced woodsman .
21.0665	Paul was on his knees now , and still rising , with Jack a close second .
10.0205	They were not three feet behind the man who labored .
4.7792	A single plunge forward must send them full upon his back .
11.5710	Some thought of his companion possibly crossed the mind of Wash just then ; for he suddenly turned his head .
2.5883	Of course he could not help but see what was behind him .
18.6940	`` Now ! ''
16.8739	whooped Bobolink and William in a breath .
5.1693	There was a simultaneous movement on the part of the five lads .
1.6106	Wash , taken by surprise , could not get up on his feet .
27.1849	He had his hands full of brush at the moment , and this also handicapped him about making any effective use of the weapons Nature gave him .
45.1399	He had just time to shout the name of his companion when the avalanche struck him , and he was bowled over as neatly as ever a football tackle got his man .
15.3409	Paul knew that they could easily manage this one fellow .
5.7273	The trouble was Wash did not happen to be alone .
9.4564	When the tall ruffian came dashing quickly to the spot there was no telling what he might not do .
7.4972	`` Hold him down , you twins .
9.3921	Do n't let him break loose .
6.4592	The rest of you follow me ! ''
15.0935	Even while speaking Paul scrambled to his feet .
98.0670	He heard the mad patter of feet as Brad came dashing toward the spot , shouting in his excitement , and doubtless believing that the prisoner had turned upon his captor .
6.5382	`` Let me loose , Paul ; quick , twist this rope around the tree ! ''
18.7682	shrilled Ted , who saw a chance to escape the punishment that had been hovering over his head .
14.8864	Paul caught the end of the rope .
92.2916	Four times did he dash around that tree , in about as many seconds ; then Ted , finding his bonds loose , squirmed free .
8.0638	But Brad was now on hand , filled with astonishment and fury .
5.8701	Whichever way he turned the rays of his car lamp he seemed to discover fresh moving figures .
7.4172	The woods seemed to be full of enemies .
1.6719	They must be hiding behind each and every tree , ready to pounce upon him .
13.8659	Already he could see that his partner was writhing on the ground , held down by an unknown number of strangers .
51.2290	In his eyes it might be these advancing figures each and every one must be a deputy sheriff , eager to have a hand in his arrest .
3.4038	So terror makes cowards of the best of men ; and Brad turned to flee .
9.4888	`` Surrender ! ''
9.5050	shouted a voice behind him .
39.7146	It was Paul calling out , but just then the alarmed culprit could not tell the voice of a boy from that of a hyena .
19.8203	Some one had called upon him to surrender , and the dread word conjured up all sorts of terrible conditions .
21.5263	Into the darkness of the woods he would have plunged , regardless of the shock that must follow a collision with an unseen tree .
8.0989	But he did not go far .
21.3560	A figure arose straight in his path , and opened a pair of arms , into the embrace of which the fleeing rascal ran .
13.8509	Before the lamp fell to the ground and went out Paul had one glimpse of a face .
13.9797	`` It 's Mr. Pender , fellows !
18.1896	Brad 's nabbed ! ''
9.6144	he could not help shouting .
62.2145	Jack , realizing the need of more light , instantly flew over to where the car was standing , and detached the second lamp .
9.0351	With this he hastened back .
83.7826	Wash was still struggling ; but the two boys had him on his face , where his superior strength was of little avail ; and were sitting on him to keep him quiet .
712.2963	When they rushed over to where Mr. Pender had been seen struggling with the taller of the ruffians , they found that he had subdued Brad ; for the other was glaring down at a pair of steel bracelets which outshone those he had so pleasantly snapped on the wrists of poor Ted .
6.8165	There was no more fight in him .
386.4228	When the other man had been treated to a similar present , they were allowed to sit upon the ground and exchange words of doleful regret , while Mr. Pender went the rounds , and gravely shook hands with each one of the Boy Scouts .
1.7318	`` You 've done me a good turn , boys , a mighty good turn .
32.7845	I was just on my way to the mill pond to arrest these chaps when I saw a light ahead , and creeping up , witnessed this interesting sight .
89.1588	When I 've found that bag now , I imagine I 'll have the case against these two worthies clean cut , '' he said .
41.5184	Upon which Paul quietly stepped over into the bushes and fished out the article in question , which he delivered to the officer .
112.0726	From Brad 's pocket was taken the wad of bills which Ted had thought to purloin from the bag before he threw it and the rest of its contents away .
1.6936	`` This is counterfeit money , boys , made from the plates in the bag .
48.0955	They were taking these things to Solus , who had written them that he had secured a nice quiet retreat where they might work undisturbed .
166.0503	So you see , my boy , '' said Mr. Pender to Ted , `` if you had made way with this it must have gotten you into a peck of trouble from the start .
0.2222	You 're lucky to get out of it as easy as you do . ''
17.5789	Ted was looking anything but cheerful .
9.2169	`` Oh !
19.5428	I knowed it was bad money all the while , sir , but I wanted to take it to the chief of police in town .
62.0902	I ai n't ever goin ' to run up against Paul Morrison and his crowd no more , after this white way they treated me .
14.1040	Not much .
2.6438	I 'm goin ' to turn over a new leaf after this .
2.9521	But please , mister , get that key from him , and take these things off .
8.1655	Makes me squirm to just feel 'em .
90.6373	But , mister , I 'm glad I did n't have to smoke , after all , '' and that seemed to be the burden of Ted 's thanksgiving .
125.2513	As to his ever turning over that promised new leaf , well , Paul believed they were more apt to find potatoes growing on apple trees than that such a wonder should come about .
189.3751	`` But I 'm not satisfied yet , boys , '' said the Government agent ; `` there 's a third one to get ; Solus Smithers , who is known to me by another name .
76.9916	Now , I wonder if I could leave these two prisoners in charge of several of you , while the rest went with me in the car ?
5.0701	I 'll make use of the rope , so they just ca n't possibly get away . ''
43.6322	It was presently decided that William , Wallace and Bobolink should stay , also Ted if he cared to remain .
6.5891	Paul and Jack would accompany Mr. Pender , so as to render any assistance needed .
72.5383	They could also bring back little Willie Boggs , should he be found under the roof of the old farmhouse by the mill pond .
37.4455	`` The worst of it is I do n't know how to handle a machine , '' remarked the gentleman , after they had stepped out on to the road .
43.1136	`` Both of us do , sir , '' remarked Paul ; `` so if you will jump aboard we 'll soon be off . ''
19.1310	`` Well , I 'd just like to learn if there is anything you Boy Scouts do n't know how to handle ? ''
75.6519	observed the pleased agent , as he saw the two lamps put back in position , though only one was allowed to remain lighted .
3.0990	It took them but a short time to draw close to the farmhouse by the pond .
5.9949	Mr. Pender jumped out and advanced through the darkness toward the door .
1.5335	Just as he reached it the boys , looking , saw it open .
14.0778	Then the voice of Sol Smithers came plainly to them .
13.5029	`` Wall , did yuh run acrost the bag , Brad ?
0.3033	I guessed 't was on ' y layin ' down the road a piece .
6.6549	But what yuh mean apushin ' in on me thetaways ? ''
16.1887	`` You 're my prisoner , Silas Westover .
0.1803	Do n't try to run , or it will be the worse for you .
4.7892	I have plenty of help and your place is surrounded .
15.5575	Wash and Brad are already in irons .
8.1314	Hold up your hands ! ''
14.5396	came in the stern voice of Mr. Pender .
43.9492	Of course the man who had called himself Solus Smithers did not offer any resistance , and he was quickly made a prisoner .
273.9285	When he found later that one man , assisted by a parcel of Boy Scouts , had captured three desperate characters , he was about as mad as a hornet ; but it was too late then to remedy matters .
12.8402	Paul and Jack immediately started a search for the missing Willie Boggs .
24.1518	The youngster was discovered fast asleep on a cot , just as the man who had found him in the woods had lain him down .
357.5270	And when Mr. Pender saw this he nodded his head , and declared that because Solus had shown that he possessed a tender heart , for all his assumed fierceness , he would make it as easy for him when the case to trial , as he could .
81.7031	After Mr. Pender had searched the place , and accumulated what evidence he needed , all of them got into the car , Willie still sound asleep .
13.0896	Then they started over the road for Stanhope .
19.6621	The town was reached at just one o'clock .
9.7941	At police headquarters Mr. Pender delivered his three prisoners for safe keeping .
44.6927	After that Paul again took the red car out to bring in the remainder of the patrol , for they were miles away from home .
9.2303	`` Why , hello !
20.6106	Paul !
8.4139	I did n't hear you ring .
7.7619	Did you fly in through the window ? ''
55.3019	Jack sprang up from the easy chair he had been occupying in the library of his own home , when his chum suddenly appeared before him .
193.4890	It was about ten o'clock on the morning following the hunt for the lost boy ; and the remarkable occurrences that had accompanied it up in the woods above Stanhope .
9.2169	`` Oh !
128.0096	you know I told you I might slip in by the back door this time ; and that is just what I did , '' replied Paul , speaking in an unusually guarded tone .
6.8808	`` That 's a fact ! ''
378.1313	exclaimed Jack , beginning to show signs of excitement ; `` and I remember that at the same time you promised -- '' `` I 'd try my best to solve the puzzle about those disappearing old coins , and tell you to-day , '' said his chum , breaking in .
12.3101	`` Well , perhaps I may , though my most promising clue has turned out a bit of a fizzle . ''
2.0206	`` But you have another up your sleeve , you said ? ''
19.3544	continued Jack , eagerly .
5.9639	`` Yes , I believe I have , '' Paul admitted .
42.8983	`` Some time later , when we get this queer affair off our hands , I want to talk with you about a lot of things connected with this scout movement .
3.4158	I got some good ideas from a bunch of papers left at our house for me .
5.0145	Guess who remembered us in such a bully way ? ''
8.1572	`` Give it up .
64.1981	I might mention every gentleman in town , and then some , '' laughed Jack ; `` for they 're all watching what we 're doing , with interest .
4.0613	But go on and tell me who it was , Paul . ''
14.0739	`` Mr. Peleg Growdy , '' came the surprising answer .
5.5412	`` Well , you do n't say ? ''
41.3786	exclaimed his chum , delight showing in his voice ; `` so the old man has really seen a great light , has he ?
1.9638	I guess he 's taking more interest in our troop than anybody else in town .
56.9159	That night 's work was the best thing that ever happened for the boys of Stanhope , as well as for Peleg .
4.0940	I take off my cap to him after this , Paul . ''
5.8008	`` But wait ; that is n't all .
12.9941	You know that Si Growdy is a nephew of his ?
6.1932	Well , he 's without a home no longer .
6.6692	Peleg sent for him , and they had a long talk .
58.4099	Si told me this morning that he 's really been adopted by his uncle , and is going to make his home with him .
15.5855	What d'ye think of that , Jack ? ''
176.8984	`` Just immense , that 's what , '' declared his companion , slapping a hand on Paul 's shoulder ; `` I 'm glad we went there and cleaned up the old man 's dooryard .
9.5928	Some of the boys thought it silly at the time ; but they understand things better now .
4.0356	He was just needing something like that to touch his heart .
6.4225	Up to then he thought all boys were pests .
5.6430	We opened his eyes some , eh ? ''
6.6032	`` That 's right , we did .
8.7301	But about those coins ! ''
25.4930	said Paul , smiling once more .
7.6990	`` Yes , first tell me who it was you suspected that has turned out innocent ? ''
10.6993	asked his chum .
9.7981	`` There he lies yonder , sleeping , with one eye open and watching us ! ''
16.4789	remarked Paul , pointing across the room .
9.2169	`` What !
20.6106	Carlo !
6.9635	You actually suspected him of taking my coins ?
5.3401	Why , Paul , whatever put that notion into your head ? ''
18.2678	demanded Jack , in sheer astonishment .
107.3114	`` Well , '' returned Paul ; `` perhaps it was silly , but then you 've taught him to fetch a basket from the baker 's , and do lots of stunts .
39.7175	I did n't know but what the sly old chap might be helping himself to your coins , and palming them off on the butcher for a supply of bones . ''
5.6276	`` That would have been the limit ! ''
10.7050	gasped his friend .
1.2057	`` But you found out that he was innocent , did you ? ''
279.9183	`` I finally went in and talked with Mr. Griggs ; but he said Carlo just came in once in a while , looking so pitifully at him , that he did n't have the heart to refuse a bone .
0.4164	So none of your lost coins have gone into his till , Jack . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
1.9365	that would have been the queerest thing ever , had he done it .
48.1297	But now about the other clue you have -- tell me about it , Paul , '' continued the anxious one .
14.7506	Paul had seated himself where he could keep an eye down the street in front of the house .
20.0137	And while his chum was talking he had smiled as if he might have discovered something out there that pleased him very much .
183.1658	`` Come right up to your den with me , Jack , and leave Carlo shut in here , '' he said , rising ; `` and when we get upstairs open the window to air the room .
36.1458	Then I shall ask you to let me hide there behind something , while you go downstairs , pass out , and along the street in plain view . ''
3.3878	`` Say , that 's a mighty queer thing to do , '' ventured the other .
4.7016	`` It 's all a part of my plan .
5.4533	You must leave the door of the den open too .
123.9764	And Jack , after you get around the corner I want you to sneak back to the rear of the house , and come up again , crawling into the den here , if everything is quiet . ''
9.2169	`` Oh !
148.7181	all right , if you say so , Paul , '' Jack observed ; `` but you 've sure got me guessing to beat the band , right now .
10.0089	Here 's the window open .
11.1994	Now shall I get busy , and meander off ? ''
11.1698	`` Right away .
7.1750	Please carry it out just as I said .
136.1121	You ought to be back here inside of six or seven minutes ; and I guess that will be time enough before the circus begins , Jack . ''
72.5718	So the owner of the little den at the top of the house gave his chum one last look of bewilderment , and turning , hastened down the stairs .
0.4459	Paul , with a glance around , chose a certain corner for his hiding-place .
7.3391	Here he could see without exposing himself to view ; and squatting down he prepared to await developments .
74.0292	A minute later he got up , and moved an old screen partly across the floor , so that it hid the open door .
64.4202	When Jack returned , he could crawl alongside the hiding boy without showing himself to any one in the room , or beyond the window .
13.2104	Hardly had five minutes crept by when Paul heard a slight sound .
23.9526	It came from the stairs , and he smiled , knowing that his chum had lost no time in carrying out his part of the plot .
257.0653	So Jack came sliding in , and was soon nestling down at Paul 's side , brimming over with curiosity , yet deterred from asking questions by the fact that Paul had put up a warning finger .
62.5490	Several more minutes passed by , when Jack was thrilled to see something moving in the direction of the partly open window .
14.1328	It seemed to be a long cane fishing rod , that had a dark colored lump at the end of it .
6.7779	The rod continued to advance slowly into the den .
276.5239	It was , of course , in the hands of some one perched in the window of the attic belonging to the empty house so close by ; and Jack could easily guess now who that person must be .
1.0806	Scissors Dempsey , once his friend , but latterly a crony of Ted Slavin !
57.8887	Now the end of the rod seemed to hover above the little box containing all that were left of Jack 's old coins .
93.3417	And even as he and Paul looked they saw it descend until the light box was tilted partly over , when the point of the long rod was pushed into it vigorously .
11.7709	Jack was reminded somewhat of a human hand groping about .
67.4626	And then , as the fishing pole was rapidly withdrawn , he saw one of his few remaining old coins sticking to the black lump at its terminus !
17.1905	The game was now clear .
481.7302	Scissors , inspired by a love of fun , or a desire to mystify Jack , perhaps make him suspect that one of his chums was taking the coins , had come every day into this empty house belonging to his father .
11.6541	Whenever he found the window in Jack 's den open he amused himself with this strange fishing .
104.9745	Paul beckoned to his chum , and then silently crept out of the den , which he was easily enabled to do , thanks to the screen he had placed to cover the open door .
17.5267	Once down on the next landing Jack clutched his sleeve .
1.4218	`` Well , would you dream of such a thing as that ? ''
13.5181	exclaimed the latter , nearly ready to explode with laughter , yet feeling a bit angry at the same time .
12.4470	`` What under the sun d'ye suppose he 's doing such a stunt for , Paul ? ''
2.8636	`` We 'd better put it up to Scissors , '' replied the other , quickly .
17.5701	`` Then you suggest waiting for him as he comes out , and telling him we know all about his fishing for my coins ? ''
20.4206	asked Jack .
10.4164	`` Come along .
14.7085	He might be satisfied with just one to-day .
35.0225	You see it 's getting harder , with so few left in the box , '' and Paul led the way downstairs again .
1.5137	`` But what 's he got on the end of that pole ? ''
10.8490	demanded his chum .
50.4848	`` I think it must be a lump of rather soft tar , or pitch , '' came Paul 's answer , readily enough .
97.3800	`` I found a little on one of the coins left the last time we examined them ; and you said that the fourth stuck to the side of the box .
5.6341	Yes , that 's what it is .
18.6221	Now , let 's wait over by the front door , for that 's the way he goes in . ''
118.2405	Five minutes later the front door of the empty house opened , and a tall boy , with spindly legs , came slily out .
6.0967	He stopped to turn a key in the lock .
88.0649	Then , as he wheeled , it was to find himself facing two fellows who were probably the very last boys in Stanhope he expected to see .
153.8808	`` Just in time to explain how you came to think of that clever little fishing dodge of yours , Scissors , '' remarked Paul ; `` and to give back all those old coins you 've been raking in so smartly .
5.9586	Thought it lots of fun , did n't you ?
25.2025	And meant to twist my chum up so he 'd think one of his own crowd had been taking them ? ''
234.7666	`` Yes , '' Jack said , in turn , looking as angry as he could ; `` and if you do n't turn every blessed copper piece over to me right away , there 's going to be trouble at your house , understand that , Scissors ? ''
14.0948	The guilty one turned red in the face .
2.9283	Then he laughed as though he wanted to consider it a joke .
9.2169	`` Oh !
9.0450	come off ! ''
15.1716	he exclaimed , with a gesture of disgust ; `` ca n't you take a little fun , Jack ?
24.5854	Of course I meant to give 'em all back again , after I 'd had my sport out of the game , and got the last coin .
22.7634	They 're upstairs here , right now .
5.0810	Come along in , and I 'll show you .
16.8819	The slick trick is gone up in smoke now , anyway ; since you got on to my curves .
2.7048	But I would n't make such a big fuss over nothing . ''
613.8970	`` It was n't the coins , because they do n't count for much ; but just think how I felt at even suspecting that some fellow who was my friend had been taking them , '' said Jack , as he and Paul followed Scissors into the empty house .
81.9157	And from the sneer on the other 's face as he looked back , Paul was inclined to believe that this was just what he had been doing the thing for .
256.0087	He disliked Jack as much now as he had once cared for him ; and would probably enjoy nothing better than to see him turn on some friend , perhaps even his best chum .
3.7110	The coins were found , as he had said , in a marble-bag in the attic .
57.1511	While Jack was counting them , Paul knelt at the window , and experimented with the long fishing rod he found on the floor .
323.5480	He discovered that he could manage to tilt the little box on the table quite easily , though it needed some labor before he brought one of the coins across the open space , glued to the pitch at the point of the rod .
5.6207	`` All there , ai n't they ? ''
11.7392	demanded Scissors .
28.1012	`` Yes , '' replied Jack ; `` though so sticky I 'll have to wash them in something like benzine .
34.7197	Perhaps you did do it for a lark , Scissors ; but I 'll make sure that a screen is in that window whenever it 's open after this . ''
11.5937	`` Huh !
70.1713	I guess the feller that invented this racket could get up somethin' just as good if he wanted , '' and that was all Scissors ever said about it to the boy he had wronged .
9.9294	Jack , having recovered his property , did not care to do anything further about the robbery .
70.2690	Later on Scissors himself told his cronies , thinking it to his credit ; and they more than a few times tried to joke Jack about his disappearing coins .
110.7050	But he took it all in good humor , and after a while the thing was apparently forgotten , because the boys of Stanhope had many other things of importance to engage their undivided attention .
25.3940	Days and weeks passed .
9.0208	In season and out , the boys of industrious Stanhope Troop worked .
17.7359	Never had the good people known such a wave of enthusiasm to sweep over the town on the Bushkill .
72.9853	It seemed as catching as the measles , this spirit of energy , and a desire to do things worth while , which had taken possession of most of the boys .
22.5149	Parents got together , and conferring , admitted that this new fad was by all odds the best thing that had ever happened .
6.3295	They determined to encourage it to the limit .
182.9357	Even those who were doubtful at the start , found themselves obliged to admit that never before had Stanhope presented such a clean appearance ; and not within the recollection of the oldest inhabitant had boys been so obliging .
204.9085	After the Stanhope Troop had been fully received into the National organization an efficient scout master was finally secured in the person of a young man by the name of Alec Gordon .
71.7595	He had lately come from visiting across the water , where he had enjoyed the personal acquaintance of several leading lights in the scout movement in England .
23.3282	Besides that , he was naturally fond of the woods , and best of all , filled with a deep love for the boy of to-day .
10.4825	Under his guidance the troop prospered , and made rapid progress along the lines started by Paul .
102.5026	The only trouble about the whole matter was that Mr. Gordon , being a traveling man , was liable to be called away just when his presence might be most needed .
29.3451	Several times this had occurred , and feeling the need of leaving a deputy to fill his place , he put it up to the boys themselves .
119.6425	Of course there had not been a dissenting vote ; and Paul was elected to play the part of guide , should an emergency arise ; and in this way he became assistant scout master of the troop .
3.0788	They need have no fear concerning his ability to fill the rôle .
1279.3414	He had proven equal to the task before now ; and there were not a few , particularly among those acknowledging the magical Red Fox as their totem , who secretly cherished a belief that Paul knew more about the secrets of Nature than any _ two _ mature scout masters .
55.5417	Every chance that offered the scouts were abroad , as busy as bees in the honey season ; only instead of laying up sweets these energetic chaps sought new information .
294.0296	They followed the trails of fox , ` coon and rabbit ; they watched the habits of the noisy crows holding a caucus in the woods ; they kept company with the red squirrel and the frolicsome chipmunk as they stored away the chestnuts and juicy hickories for their winter 's supply of food .
57.1309	And on every occasion they labored to make themselves perfect in those branches of wood lore , and the knowledge of useful things , which they expected would play a prominent part in the approaching competition .
468.4120	Just as Paul and Wallace had predicted , it was found that nearly every fellow had a love for Nature and her wonderful secrets somewhere in his system ; even though with a few this breath had to be fanned vigorously in order to keep it alive .
179.7706	Of course they were annoyed again and again by Ted Slavin and his envious followers ; for the bully of the town had drifted back to his old ways , as might have been expected .
72.4427	When peaceful tactics failed to stop these malicious tricks , the scout master personally appealed to the authorities , and a warning was issued that , for a time at least , dismayed the disturbers of the meetings .
9.2466	But when they could do so in secret , they never lost an opportunity to play some sly trick .
6.0318	Another thing that had been anticipated came to pass .
14.2557	This was the utter failure of Ward 's cronies to maintain any interest in the duties of scouts .
141.7874	Those twelve cardinal virtues that must at all times be held up before the fellow who expects to become and remain a Boy Scout in good standing , failed to appeal to these rough and ready chaps .
438.4702	It would indeed require a revolution in boy nature to make Ted Slavin , or his crony , Scissors , trustworthy , loyal , helpful to others , friendly , courteous , kind , obedient to his superior officers , cheerful , thrifty , brave , clean and reverent !
1280.0882	Just a few days before Thanksgiving the scout master came to Paul with the distressing news that he had received an imperative summons from his firm to go out on the road ; so that it would debar him from being present when the long-looked-for-competition took place .
724.6312	`` But , '' said Mr. Gordon , as he shook Paul by the hand earnestly ; `` I firmly believe that you will be able to fill my place so well that my absence will not make the slightest difference , '' and Paul , of course , simply said he would do his best .
0.5916	The fellows of Stanhope Troop knew full well what that `` best '' meant .
754.5322	But as the boys of Manchester Troop and that of Aldine as well , learned through some of their energetic scouts , what a strong bid these patrols of the Fox were going to make , in the hope of winning that coveted banner , they seemed to be stirred to make new endeavors .
174.0013	Paul managed to keep advised of pretty much all that was going on ; since this was a part of a scout 's duty ; though no mean advantage was ever taken of the rival camps -- he would not stand for that .
53.6669	In a quiet way he had learned how their meetings became more frequent , and the desire to excel , that had threatened to dwindle away for lack of rivalry , grew more keen .
16.9360	Paul was glad of it .
4.6937	Competition is the life of trade ; but it also encourages boys to do their level best .
1.5928	There would be a brave fight for that banner ; and no walk-over .
2.9008	The troop that won it might well be proud of the honor .
15.2139	And Paul was still full of faith .
266.3662	He watched his scouts go through their various interesting stunts with a growing conviction that they must stand at the head when the day came for the meeting , and the report of the committee appointed to make the test was declared .
62.4081	He knew that fortune had been very kind in allowing himself and Jack to make a heavy score in favor of Stanhope Troop .
12.4560	The stopping of the runaway horse , and the saving of the baby at the fire would bring them many points .
2750.7897	Then there was the wonderful letter from Washington , on official paper too , in which Mr. Jared Pender told the story of how much he had been helped by the Red Fox patrol in his task of capturing those desperate rascals who were flooding the whole country with their bogus money .
231.0808	But Paul was determined that , aside from the help afforded by these glorious deeds , the boys of Stanhope should excel all others in their knowledge of woodcraft , and the valuable things every boy with red blood in his veins should possess .
0.2176	So they kept up the good work after the scout master had left them .
6.5006	Long since had Bobolink received his bugle , and William his drum .
575.1728	Both proved very able in managing these musical instruments , and the shrill notes of the one , and the roll of the other , had become very familiar and acceptable sounds in Stanhope these fall days , when the first snow made its appearance .
178.0351	Already had they planned a great camp for the next summer , and there was talk of a grand hike into the almost unknown , to them , country far to the north .
756.9872	What strange adventures were destined to befall them during this eventful outing , together with the fun that William and Bobolink afforded the troop , will be recounted in the next volume , to be called : `` The Banner Boy Scouts on a Tour ; or , The Mystery of Rattlesnake Mountain . ''
9.6235	Even at school the teachers noticed that things seemed to move along much more smoothly than ever before .
182.8996	Some of them were inclined to suspect that a miracle had been wrought in boy nature ; until it was shown that there were still quite a number of transgressors , and that not one of the bad ones belonged to the scouts .
721.3694	That opened their eyes , and after such evidence they were one and all heartily in favor of the organization that kept lads interested , taught them every noble duty that would make them better men later on , caused them to be manly , heroic , self-confident in time of sudden peril , and able to stand up for their rights .
18.9852	Thanksgiving came at last .
6.4750	The entire county showed a keen interest in the rivalry of the three troops for leadership .
398.3487	Each had its sturdy backers , who believed their home company to be the best ; and hence when the choice of situation fell to Manchester , it looked as though nearly the entire population of Stanhope and Aldine had also gathered to cheer their favorites on .
10.2302	The competition was keenly contested .
209.8779	A dozen different events had been scheduled some time back by the committee , as the more important elements that would enter into the struggle ; and the scout master of each patrol had been notified , so that he might select those most competent to succeed .
45.0854	Scout master Gordon , and later on his deputy , Paul , had been working with those who excelled in these various lines .
4.3033	Nothing was left undone to make them proficient in their work .
81.5642	When the critical time came , and before the eyes of thousands they lined up before the committee to take the test , Paul believed that success was sure to come .
72.3030	Football was in the air for the afternoon ; but that morning every school flag fluttered in that densely packed field where the arena was laid .
307.1695	Scores upon scores of pretty girls clapped their hands , and sang patriotic songs that had reference to their particular town , whenever a Stanhope , a Manchester or an Aldine competitor started to prove his superior knowledge of the arts of woodcraft .
15.6092	Wallace Carberry brought the first honors to the Red Fox patrol .
28.2354	He had his quart of water boiling a full minute before either of his rivals ; and retired amid thunderous applause .
25.7862	Wallace would show up in several other events , for he was the mainstay of Paul 's contesting delegation .
10.9680	Then came other interesting object lessons .
38.6913	Many present failed to understand altogether what they signified ; but they were patriotic , and ready to cheer the victor to the echo .
124.2209	On account of the lateness of the season several events that might have taken place at another time were debarred , such as swimming , fishing , and sports peculiar to the good old summer time .
5.7697	Nevertheless , there were plenty of others equally as interesting .
11.2039	Three boys entered as contestants in the rapid photography class .
100.9945	They took a snap shot at a given word , darted into separate prepared dark rooms , developed their plates , dried the same , each after his own fashion , and presented a completed picture before the other competitions were done .
55.4858	Meanwhile three others showed just how a scout should learn to follow a difficult trail , where all manner of obstacles stood in the way .
249.6142	While the crowd could not fully understand just how this was done , the committee seemed unanimous in awarding the victory once more to Wallace , for he had not made a single error , and he finished ahead of his rivals .
102.8707	Others were set to work tying ten difficult knots , and the fun waxed fast and furious as they worked their nimble fingers , keeping an eye on each other the while .
187.2427	In another place three tents were given to squads of boys from each patrol , and at the word they set to work to erect the same , dig a water drain in case of rain , and have everything in `` apple-pie '' shape .
40.4864	The committee gave plain warning that it was not speed alone that would count here , but the general ship-shape condition following the carrying out of the conditions .
4.6810	And again the boys of the Stanhope Troop came in winners by a good margin .
0.4973	Manchester drew a prize when the contest of landing a big fish came on .
16.0372	A boy played the part of the fish , and fought with all his strength and cunning to keep from being reeled in .
154.5367	But big Carl Evans , the Manchester fisherman , proved to be too strong and able for those who competed , and had his fish landed minutes ahead .
8.6570	The archers then took a turn .
15.7217	Here Aldine presented a clever expert , who had made this his especial hobby for some years .
34.1432	He could not be headed , though the other fellows from Stanhope and Manchester really made a very creditable showing .
108.0729	One of the most interesting exhibitions of the morning , and one that excited considerable cheering , was the `` first aid to the injured . ''
4.2625	A boy was supposed to have fallen overboard into the river .
78.7087	In each case several contestants pretended to drag him out , placing him face downward , with his arms above his head , and his face a little to one side .
38.2871	Then one of the rescuers knelt astride the body , allowing his hands to press upon the spaces between the short ribs .
136.7483	By pressing downward the air was forced from the other 's lungs , to creep in again when this was relaxed ; and in this fashion an artificial respiration was induced that should grow stronger as minutes passed .
79.9091	Of course , as no boy was so accommodating as to fall into the cold waters of the Bushkill for the occasion , the contestants finished at the same time .
13.7984	The committee , after mature consultation , awarded the victory to the team accomplishing their work in the most business-like fashion .
6.6133	Aldine was so fortunate as to receive the award , and her people shouted themselves hoarse .
109.7313	In athletics the three competing troops proved very nearly even ; and brought out rounds of cheers as they followed one another in carrying out the several events scheduled .
550.3604	Possibly when William proved his great superiority as a camp cook , by making the batter , and cooking a luscious flap-jack long before any other fellow could accomplish the feat , his victory was the most popular one of the day .
106.9914	Fully five score of fellows made motions to prove they were starved , and that a bite from the airy pancake would possibly serve as a life saver .
31.8140	But after the committee had tested it , William calmly devoured the balance , to the tune of mingled groans and cheers .
52.8469	Last of all came the wig-wagging contest , when boys sent and received messages fashioned by the committee , the nature of which was unknown at the other end .
172.0398	In this Stanhope again made a record that put her boys in the van , for Paul had secured and studied the army manual on using the signal flags , and to good advantage .
850.0379	After the twelfth and last event had been completed , the committee went into session , examined the papers they already held , and finally announced that Stanhope had carried off the prize with six clean events , the others being equally divided between the two clever troops from the other towns .
7.8608	It was undoubtedly a popular victory , judging from the record-breaking volume of noise that greeted the announcement .
53.9869	What else the chairman would have said , with regard to the great good the establishment of these patrols had brought to the county , was drowned in the wild clamor .
52.4646	Paul , acting for the absent scout master , accepted the beautiful banner presented by the good old Quaker who loved peace above all things .
373.8749	He was immediately swept off his feet , and carried in triumph around the field , waving the emblem that would from that hour stamp the Stanhope Troop as the Banner Boy Scouts of the county .
26.1264	Little Paul cared that some frowned , or that Ward Kenwood sneered as the procession marched past .
216.8736	Close by he could see the happy face of Arline , together with those of his parents ; and it satisfied him to know that through his unflagging perseverance he had been able to land his scouts in the van .
129.5250	Other trials and contests would doubtless have to be encountered ; but with that banner to encourage then the Fox patrols could meet each emergency as it arose , and struggle on through difficulties to a glorious success .
9.7136	`` Is that the latest style ? ''
51.6386	inquired James Leech , with a sneer , pointing to a patch on the knee of Herbert Carter 's pants .
19.5219	Herbert 's face flushed .
10.0373	He was not ashamed of the patch , for he knew that his mother 's poverty made it a necessity .
219.8565	But he felt that it was mean and dishonorable in James Leech , whose father was one of the rich men of Wrayburn , to taunt him with what he could not help .
7.2346	Some boys might have slunk away abashed , but Herbert had pluck and stood his ground .
11.9356	`` It is my style , '' he answered , firmly , looking James boldly in the face .
6.7637	`` I admire your taste , then , '' returned James , with a smooth sneer .
5.7377	`` Then , you had better imitate it , '' retorted Herbert .
3.2310	`` Thank you , '' said James , in the same insulting tone .
4.8758	`` Would you lend me your pants for a pattern ?
2.6180	Excuse me , though ; perhaps you have no other pair . ''
15.4415	`` For shame , James ! ''
374.8408	exclaimed one or two boys who had listened to the colloquy , stirred to indignation by this heartless insult on the part of James Leech to a boy who was deservedly a favorite with them all .
68.0558	Herbert 's fist involuntarily doubled , and James , though he did not know it , ran a narrow chance of getting a good whipping .
67.0306	But our young hero controlled himself , not without some difficulty , and said : `` I have one other pair , and these are at your service whenever you require them . ''
25.6596	Then turning to the other boys , he said , in a changed tone : `` Who 's in for a game of ball ? ''
11.4329	`` I , '' said one , promptly .
5.7899	`` And I , '' said another .
0.8995	Herbert walked away , accompanied by the other boys , leaving James Leech alone .
15.7090	James looked after him with a scowl .
58.8020	He was sharp enough to see that Herbert , in spite of his patched pants , was a better scholar and a greater favorite than himself .
73.7059	He had intended to humiliate him on the present occasion , but he was forced to acknowledge that he had come off second best from the encounter .
182.2340	He walked moodily away , and took what comfort he could in the thought that he was far superior to a boy who owned but two pairs of pants , and one of them patched .
97.2030	He was foolish enough to feel that a boy or man derived importance from the extent of his wardrobe ; and exulted in the personal possession of eight pairs of pants .
9.6864	This scene occurred at recess .
14.7489	After school was over , Herbert walked home .
9.2968	He was a little thoughtful .
3.3323	There was no disgrace in a patch , as he was sensible enough to be aware .
5.5472	Still , he would have a little preferred not to wear one .
9.3231	That was only natural .
0.1987	In that point , I suppose , my readers will fully agree with him .
56.2862	But he knew very well that his mother , who had been left a widow , had hard work enough to get along as it was , and he had no idea of troubling her on the subject .
138.2368	Besides , he had a better suit for Sundays , neat though plain , and he felt that he ought not to be disturbed by James Leech 's insolence .
2.8225	So thinking , he neared the small house which he called home .
23.5433	It was a small cottage , with something less than an acre of land attached , enough upon which to raise a few vegetables .
64.5535	It belonged to his mother , nominally , but was mortgaged for half its value to Squire Leech , the father of James .
0.9877	The amount of the mortgage , precisely , was seven hundred and fifty dollars .
20.3146	It had cost his father fifteen hundred .
53.1641	When he built it , obtaining half this sum on mortgage , he hoped to pay it up by degrees ; but it turned out that , from sickness and other causes , this proved impossible .
70.2746	When , five months before , he had died suddenly , the house , which was all he left , was subject to this incumbrance .
0.6367	Upon this , interest was payable semi-annually at the rate of six per cent .
234.3589	Forty-five dollars a year is not a large sum , but it seemed very large to Mrs. Carter , when added to their necessary expenses for food , clothing and fuel .
4.0092	How it was to be paid she did not exactly see .
54.7129	The same problem had perplexed Herbert , who , like a good son as he was , shared his mother 's cares and tried to lighten them .
27.6345	But in a small village like Wrayburn there are not many ways of getting money , at any rate for a boy .
4.8012	There were no manufactories , as in some large villages , and money was a scarce commodity .
15.4583	Herbert had , however , one source of income .
575.8864	Half a dozen families , living at some distance from the post office , employed him to bring any letters or papers that might come for them , and for this service he received a regular tariff of two cents for each letter , and one cent for each paper .
15.2465	He was not likely to grow rich on this income , but he felt that , though small , it was welcome .
0.4065	According to custom , Herbert called at the post office on his way home .
140.9191	He found a letter for Deacon Crossleigh , one for Mr. Duncan , two for Dr. Waffit , and papers for each of the two former .
23.3437	`` Ten cents ! ''
9.8394	he thought with satisfaction .
12.0695	`` Well , that is better than nothing , though it wo n't buy me a new pair of pants . ''
148.7791	He was about to leave the office , when the postmaster called after him : `` Wait a minute , Herbert ; I believe there 's a letter for your mother . ''
80.6771	Herbert returned , and received a letter bearing the following superscription : `` Mrs. Almira Carter , Wrayburn , New York . ''
1.7243	`` I hope it is n't bad news , '' said the postmaster .
5.6144	`` I see it 's edged with black . ''
17.6921	`` I ca n't make out where it 's from , '' said Herbert , scanning the postmark critically .
4.1766	`` Nor I , '' said the postmaster , rubbing his glasses , and taking another look .
7.8929	`` The postmark is very indistinct . ''
8.9939	`` There 's an n and a p , '' said Herbert , after a little examination .
11.6194	`` I think it must be Randolph . ''
19.8958	`` Randolph ?
7.8618	So it is , I declare .
6.0849	Have you got any friends or relatives living there ? ''
10.4608	`` Yes , my mother 's Uncle Herbert , for whom I was named , lives there . ''
7.1270	`` Then he must be dead . ''
7.6747	`` What makes you think so ? ''
7.8620	`` The envelope is edged with black .
0.2176	You had better carry it home before you go round with the others . ''
12.8087	`` Perhaps I had , '' said Herbert .
1.6219	`` I 'll run , so as not to keep the others waiting .
10.7127	Deacon Crossleigh is always in a hurry for his paper . ''
36.7209	`` Yes , the deacon 's always in a fidget to know what 's going on , particularly when Congress is in session .
6.8350	He takes a wonderful interest in politics . ''
19.5660	Herbert ran up the street with a quick step , pausing a minute at his humble home .
12.8305	`` You are out of breath , Herbert .
9.0876	Have you been running ? ''
17.1887	`` Yes , I 've got a letter for you , and I wanted to bring it before I went round with the rest . ''
9.4168	`` A letter !
10.6979	Where from ? ''
18.4859	asked the widow , with curiosity , for she held very little intercourse with the world outside of Wrayburn .
2.8100	`` It 's postmarked Randolph , as well as I can make out .
12.4440	While you are reading it , I 'll run and leave my letters , and be back to hear the news . ''
9.4692	In a hurry to do all his errands and get back , Herbert ran all the way .
115.4903	While his eyes were fixed on one of the envelopes , he ran full against James Leech , who was walking up the street with a pompous air .
2.8530	In the encounter James 's hat came off , and he was nearly thrown down .
6.4324	`` What made you run into me ? ''
13.8906	he demanded , wrath-fully .
7.4780	`` Excuse me , James , '' said Herbert , recovering himself .
3.3513	`` You did it on purpose , '' said his enemy , glaring at him angrily .
10.0795	`` That is n't very likely , '' said Herbert .
4.9528	`` I got hit as hard as you did . ''
6.8509	`` Your hat did n't get knocked off .
17.1806	Pick it up , '' said James , imperiously , pointing to it as it lay in the path .
38.3530	`` I will , because it is by my fault that it fell , '' said Herbert , stooping over and picking it up .
3.2604	`` You need n't have ordered me to do it . ''
13.2705	`` The next time take care how you run against a gentleman , '' said James , arrogantly .
2.8184	`` Take care the next time to speak like a gentleman . ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
12.0683	`` Good night !
8.7275	I must be off . ''
10.5142	`` Insolent beggar ! ''
21.6170	muttered James .
6.8536	`` He do n't know his place .
5.4222	How dare he speak to me in that way ? ''
8.4566	Half an hour later , Herbert reentered the cottage , breathless with running .
4.5200	`` Well , mother , what is it ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
10.9238	`` Uncle Herbert is dead , '' she answered .
8.4107	`` When did he die ? ''
26.5355	`` Yesterday morning .
17.7700	They wrote at once .
6.8616	The funeral is to take place to-morrow afternoon , at three o'clock . ''
5.2238	`` Uncle Herbert was rich , was n't he , mother ? ''
4.7321	`` Yes , he must have left nearly a hundred thousand dollars . ''
6.9298	`` What a pile of money ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
3.1118	`` I wonder how a man feels when he is so rich .
8.2298	He ought to be happy . ''
8.7561	`` Riches do n't always bring happiness .
3.9017	Uncle Herbert was disappointed in early life , and that seemed to spoil his career .
14.5815	He gave himself up to money-making , and succeeded in it ; but he lived by himself and had few sources of happiness . ''
6.4681	`` Then he had no family ? ''
8.4583	`` No . ''
2.4393	`` Do you think he has left us anything , mother ? ''
9.9059	asked Herbert , with something of hope in his tone .
8.6323	`` I am afraid not .
4.1557	If he had been disposed to do that he would have done something for us before .
4.8600	He knew that we were poor , and that a little assistance would have been very acceptable .
8.3414	But he never offered it .
222.3743	Even when your father was sick for three months , and I wrote to him for a small loan , he refused , saying that we ought to have laid up money to fall back upon at such a time . ''
2.9496	`` I do n't see how a man can be so unfeeling .
19.9733	If he would only leave us a thousand dollars , how much good it would do us !
1.4966	We could pay up the mortgage on the house , and have something left over .
3.3652	It would n't have been much for him to do . ''
5.7015	`` Well , we wo n't think too much about it , '' said Mrs. Carter .
3.2659	`` It will be wisest , as probably we should be only preparing ourselves for disappointment .
1.5315	Uncle had a right to do what he pleased with his own . ''
5.1782	`` Shall you go to the funeral , mother ? ''
3.0359	`` I do n't see how I can , '' said Mrs. Carter , slowly .
0.5843	`` It is twenty miles off , and I am very busy just now .
13.6443	Still one of us ought to go , if only to show respect to so near a relation .
7.9522	People would talk if we did n't .
12.6283	I think , as you were named for your Uncle Herbert , I will let you go . ''
7.7838	`` If you think best , mother .
4.6794	I will walk , and that will save expense . ''
1.3941	`` It will be too much for you to take such a walk .
8.9465	You had better ride . ''
4.4023	`` No , mother , I am young and strong .
8.5143	I can walk well enough . ''
5.2860	`` But it must be twenty miles , '' objected his mother .
8.3603	`` The funeral does n't take place till three o'clock in the afternoon .
7.6674	I will get up bright and early , say at five o'clock .
13.6447	By nine I shall be halfway there . ''
37.6473	`` I am afraid it will be too much for you , Herbert , '' said Mrs. Carter , irresolutely .
49.7368	`` You do n't know how strong I am , '' said Herbert ; `` I sha n't get tired so easily as you think . ''
10.4547	`` But twenty miles is a long distance . ''
3.4976	`` I know that , but I shall take it easy .
7.8934	The stage fare is seventy-five cents , and it 's a good way to save it .
6.6887	I wish somebody would offer me seventy-five cents for every twenty miles I would walk .
4.9765	I 'd take it up as a profession . ''
5.3919	`` I am afraid I could earn little that way .
7.5245	I never was a good walker . ''
6.7233	`` You 're a woman , '' said Herbert , patronizingly .
5.0113	`` Women are not expected to be good walkers . ''
8.5478	`` Some are .
38.1902	I remember my Aunt Jane would take walks of five and six miles , and think nothing of it . ''
3.1916	`` I guess I could match her in walking , '' said Herbert , confidently .
8.6623	`` Is she alive ? ''
14.4108	`` No , she died three years since . ''
5.2632	`` Perhaps I take after her , then . ''
1.2453	`` You do n't take after me , I am sure of that .
188.7263	I think , Herbert , you had better take seventy-five cents with you , so that if you get very tired with your walk over , you can come back by stage . ''
12.7758	`` All right , mother ; I 'll take the money , but I shall be sure not to need it . ''
5.0024	`` It is best to be prepared for emergencies , Herbert . ''
40.7061	`` If I am going to-morrow morning , I must split up enough wood to last you while I am gone . ''
6.9802	`` I am afraid you will tire yourself .
0.2374	I think I can get along with what wood there is already split . ''
5.9827	`` Oh , do n't be afraid for me .
0.2393	You 'll see I 'll come back as fresh as when I set out .
5.2012	I expect to have a stunning appetite , though . ''
5.2530	`` I 'll try to cook up enough for you , '' said his mother , smiling .
18.8996	Herbert went out into the wood shed , and went to work with great energy at the wood pile .
80.0822	In the course of an hour he had sawed and split several large baskets full , which he brought in and piled up behind the kitchen stove .
10.9464	Mrs. Carter could not be expected to feel very deep grief for the death of her uncle .
21.3174	It was now more than six years since they had met .
0.2112	He was a selfish man , wholly wrapped up in the pursuit of wealth .
59.7562	Had he possessed benevolent instincts , he would have offered to do something out of his abundance for his niece , who he knew found it very hard to make both ends meet .
7.0130	But he was a man who was very much averse to parting with his money while he lived .
41.4547	He lived on a tenth of his income , and saved up the rest , though for what end he could not well have told .
222.0558	Since the death of Mr. Carter , whose funeral he had not taken the trouble to attend , though invited , he had not even written to his niece , and she had abstained from making any advances , lest it might be thought that she was seeking assistance .
629.7740	Under these circumstances she had little hope of a legacy , though she could not help admitting the thought of how much a few hundred dollars would help her , bridging over the time till Herbert should be old enough to earn fair wages in some employment .
213.1065	If he could study two or three years longer , she would have been very glad , for her son had already shown abilities of no common order ; but that was hardly to be thought of .
121.6563	`` There , mother , I guess I 've sawed wood enough to last you , unless you are very extravagant , '' said Herbert , reentering the kitchen , and taking off his cap .
12.2309	`` Now is there anything else I can do ?
32.5407	You know I shall be gone two days , or a day and a half at any rate . ''
13.3391	`` I think of nothing , Herbert .
44.8174	You had better go to bed early , and get a good night 's rest , for you will have a hard day before you . ''
7.6427	`` So I will , but eight o'clock will be soon enough .
2.8766	Just suppose we should get a legacy , after all , mother .
9.3026	Would n't it be jolly ? ''
7.0397	`` I would n't think too much of it , Herbert .
7.2168	There is n't much chance of it .
45.9414	Besides , it does n't seem right to be speculating about our own personal advantage when Uncle Herbert lies dead in his house . ''
141.5556	There was justice in this suggestion , but Herbert could hardly be expected to take a mournful view of the death of a relative whom he hardly remembered , and who had appeared scarcely to be aware of his existence .
7.2381	It was natural that the thought of his wealth should be uppermost in his young nephew 's mind .
129.3349	The reader will hardly be surprised to hear that Herbert , knowing only too well the disadvantages of poverty , should have speculated a little about his uncle 's property after he went to bed .
2.8904	Indeed , it did not leave him even with his waking consciousness .
20.1308	He dreamed that his uncle left him a big lump of gold , so big and heavy that he could not lift it .
124.8568	He was considering anxiously how in the world he was going to get it home , when all at once he awoke , and heard the church clock strike five .
5.5591	`` Time I was on my way ! ''
11.7383	he thought , and , jumping out of bed , he dressed himself as quickly as possible , and went downstairs .
0.1784	But , early as it was , his mother , was down before him .
3.0791	There was a fire in the kitchen stove , and the cloth was laid for breakfast .
4.1938	`` What made you get up so early , mother ? ''
20.4206	asked Herbert .
20.9295	`` I would n't have you go away without breakfast , Herbert , especially for such a long walk . ''
5.9372	`` I meant to take something from the closet .
7.3110	That would have done well enough . ''
1.5909	`` You will be all the better for a good , warm cup of tea .
11.7733	Sit right down .
8.0379	It is all ready . ''
6.5656	Early as it was , the breakfast tasted good .
3.1521	Herbert ate hastily , for he was anxious to be on his way .
63.6556	Knowing that he could not afford to buy lunch , he put the remnants of the breakfast , including some slices of bread and butter and meat , into his satchel , and started on his long walk .
21.5498	Herbert had never been to Randolph .
5.4922	In fact , he had never been so far away from Wrayburn .
5.1859	He was not afraid of losing his way , however .
19.0273	Here and there along the road guideposts were conveniently placed , and these removed any difficulty on that score .
6.0823	When he had gone about six miles , the coach rattled by .
37.5866	It had started more than an hour later .
0.3897	Herbert turned out for the lumbering vehicle , and waited for it to pass .
26.5281	There was a boy on top , but such was the cloud of dust that he could not at first recognize him .
61.2742	It happened , however , that one of the traces broke , so that the driver was compelled to make a stop just as he overtook our hero .
11.8193	Then he saw that the boy on top was James Leech .
0.6769	With James curiosity overcame his disinclination to speak to one so far beneath him .
9.1834	`` Where are you going .
19.2776	Carter ? ''
10.5448	he inquired .
11.8869	`` To Randolph , '' was the answer .
6.9816	`` Going to walk all the way ? ''
3.1076	`` I expect to , '' said Herbert , not relishing the cross-examination .
8.5916	`` Why do n't you ride ? ''
16.7938	James did not ask for information .
123.6965	He knew well enough already , but as there are purse-proud men , so there are boys who are actuated by feelings equally unworthy , and it delighted him to remind Herbert of his poverty .
16.5098	Herbert divined this , but he was proud in his way , and answered : `` Because I choose . ''
82.4149	`` Well , you must like the dust , that 's all , '' said James , complacently tapping his well-polished boot with a light cane which he had bought .
8.1798	`` Where are you going ? ''
5.7797	asked Herbert , thinking it about time for him to commence questioning .
12.5503	`` I 'm going to Randolph , too , '' answered James , with unwonted affability .
24.1771	`` I 'm going to stop a few days with a friend of mine , Tom Spencer .
3.2245	His father 's a rich man -- got a nice place there .
5.3061	Did n't you ever hear of Mr. Spencer , the lawyer ? ''
5.8548	`` I do n't think I have . ''
7.6848	`` That 's his father .
4.8315	He makes a load of money by his law business .
8.5069	I think I shall study law some time .
7.2873	Perhaps I 'll go into partnership with him .
6.9509	What are you going to be ? ''
9.9964	`` I do n't know yet , '' said Herbert .
11.5267	`` I suppose you 'll be a mechanic of some kind -- a carpenter , or mason , or bricklayer . ''
11.6620	`` Perhaps so , '' said Herbert , quietly .
10.6032	`` What are you going to Randolph for ? ''
17.8962	asked James , with sudden curiosity .
6.3803	`` To attend my uncle 's funeral . ''
6.5275	`` What 's your uncle 's name ? ''
8.3211	`` The same as mine . ''
6.9807	`` I suppose he was poor . ''
6.2444	`` No , he was rich . ''
8.1541	`` Was he ? ''
15.9323	repeated James , in some surprise .
6.0346	`` What do you think he was worth ? ''
24.8861	`` About a hundred thousand dollars . ''
11.4382	`` Sho !
8.8914	you do n't say so .
20.9784	Perhaps , '' continued James , with new-born respect , `` he has left you something in his will . ''
7.0688	`` I do n't think so . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
57.9600	`` He has n't shown any interest in us for six years , and I do n't think he 'll remember us now . ''
21.6892	James looked thoughtful .
6.0521	He had never before heard of this relationship , or he would have treated Herbert differently .
2.1916	The mere fact of having a wealthy relative elevated our hero considerably in his eyes .
3.1448	Then , too , there was a possibility that Herbert would turn out a legatee .
7.2481	`` When is your uncle 's funeral ? ''
8.3743	he inquired , after a pause .
23.8628	`` This afternoon . ''
6.6757	`` You wo n't get there in time .
6.6690	You had better get up and ride . ''
6.5523	`` No , I guess not . ''
6.6761	`` Well , perhaps I shall meet you at Randolph . ''
20.3431	By this time the harness was repaired , the driver resumed his seat , and whipped up the horses to make up for lost time .
54.1417	`` I 'm glad I do n't think as much of money as James Leech , '' thought Herbert .
102.4408	`` I suppose if my uncle would only leave us a good round sum , he would forget that I once wore patched pants , and accept me as his intimate friend . ''
75.0459	This was exactly what James would have done , and Herbert showed that he was not wholly without knowledge of the world in forming the conjecture .
35.1997	Pausing occasionally to rest , Herbert at length accomplished his journey , arriving at Randolph a little after noon .
13.0550	He stopped just outside the village and ate his frugal dinner , which by this time he was prepared to relish .
31.8775	He then took off his jacket and beat the dust out of it , dusted his shoes , and washed his face in a little brook by the roadside .
16.7242	Having thus effaced the marks of travel , he entered the village and inquired the way to the residence of his late uncle .
24.5341	He found out where it was , but did not go there yet , knowing that there would be preparations going on for the funeral .
43.7228	Neither did he go to the tavern , for he knew that he would be expected to dine there , and this was an expense which he did not feel able to incur .
30.1696	He threw himself down in the shade of a tree , and remained there until after he heard the church clock strike two .
53.1582	He was still lying there when a young man , smartly dressed , sporting a showy watch chain and locket and an immense necktie , came up the street and accosted him .
19.4056	`` I say , boy , can you tell me where old man Carter 's house is ? ''
14.0961	`` Yes , '' said Herbert .
7.4306	`` Do you want to go there ? ''
8.2469	`` Of course I do .
14.4321	I 'm one of the relatives .
0.5183	I 've come all the way from New York to attend the funeral . ''
4.0326	`` I 'm one of the relations , too , '' said Herbert .
7.7481	`` We 'll go along together . ''
13.3866	`` By Jove , that 's strange !
6.9201	How are you related to the old chap ? ''
10.6632	drawled the young man .
5.8129	`` He was my mother 's uncle . ''
8.5478	`` Was he ?
5.2975	Well , I 'm a second or third cousin , I do n't know which .
7.9361	Never saw him to my knowledge .
11.7222	In fact , I would n't have come on to the funeral if I had n't heard that he was rich .
8.8630	Expect to be remembered ? ''
8.0574	`` I do n't think so .
2.5498	He has n't taken any notice of mother or myself for years . ''
10.3044	`` Indeed ! ''
1.7156	said the young man , who was rather pleased to hear this intelligence .
4.5081	`` Are there many relations , do you know ? ''
5.7765	`` I do n't think there are . ''
8.6865	`` That 's good .
6.3930	It makes our chance better , you know .
6.2302	I say , what 's your name ? ''
24.2788	`` Herbert Carter . ''
7.0692	`` Same as the old man 's ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
3.9436	`` Did he know you was named for him ? ''
9.0291	`` Of course . ''
11.4820	`` Then he may leave you something for the name , '' suggested the other , not very well pleased .
8.3492	`` I do n't expect anything .
8.4042	What is your name ? ''
26.5355	`` Cornelius Dixon .
1.4767	I 'm related to the old man on my mother 's side . ''
17.0961	`` Are you in business in New York ? ''
109.1493	asked Herbert , who , in spite of the queer manners of his new relative , felt considerable respect for one who hailed from so important a city .
6.6008	`` Yes , I 'm a salesman in a New York store .
9.5072	Where do you live ? ''
16.7880	`` In Wrayburn . ''
9.1626	`` Where 's that ? ''
16.3673	`` About twenty miles from here . ''
7.5015	`` Some one-horse country town , I suppose .
7.7118	Are you in any business ? ''
0.3324	`` No , '' said Herbert , `` but I 'd like to be .
7.1504	Do you think you could get me a place in New York ? ''
39.4630	`` Well , '' said Cornelius , flattered by the belief in his influence which this inquiry implied , `` perhaps I might .
8.9796	You can give me your name and address , so I can write to you if I hear of anything .
90.5094	If the old man only leaves me a few thousand dollars , I 'll go into business for myself , and then I 'd have an opening for you . ''
5.9804	`` I hope he will , then . ''
8.9676	`` So do I .
7.5485	That is where we both agree .
2.5518	But perhaps it will be you that will get the cash . ''
7.0688	`` I do n't think so . ''
4.1232	`` If you do , put it into my hands , and go into partnership with me .
6.1039	I 've got business experience , you know ; while you 're green , countrified , you know .
4.7131	It would never do for you to start alone . ''
3.9622	`` No , I should n't think of it . ''
5.3053	`` Then it 's agreed , is it ? ''
19.8725	said Cornelius .
0.1952	`` If I get a legacy , I 'll take you into my store .
1.3764	If you get it , you will go into partnership with me . ''
40.8725	`` I 'm willing , '' said Herbert , who really believed that his companion had as valuable business qualifications as he claimed .
388.3772	How was he to know that the pretentious Cornelius was only a salesman , at twelve dollars a week , in a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue ?
0.2798	By this time they had reached the rather dingy-looking house of their deceased relative .
9.6638	The front door was open .
2.8081	They passed through the gate , and , entering , took their places with the mourners .
8.6711	Apparently the deceased had but few relatives .
22.6356	But six persons were in a small room appropriated to the mourners when our hero and his new acquaintance entered .
53.7794	One of these , and far the most imposing in appearance , was a stout lady , who quite filled up the only armchair in the room .
43.0547	In a plain chair close by was a meek little man , three inches shorter , and probably not more than half her weight .
24.1824	A boy and girl , the children of the ill-matched pair , the former resembling the father , the latter the mother , were ranged alongside .
12.4727	Permit me to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Pinkerton , of Castleton , an adjoining town .
33.6366	Master Albert and Miss Nancy Pinkerton .
3.2816	Mrs. Pinkerton is a milliner , and her husband is her clerk and errand boy .
55.7608	She has considerable business capacity , and makes enough to support the family comfortably , besides adding something annually to the fund in the savings bank .
4.2253	The relationship to the deceased is on the side of the husband , who is a cousin .
77.3628	This relationship has given rise to great expectations on the part of Mrs. Pinkerton , who fully expects to inherit half the estate of Mr. Carter .
40.1671	`` If we get it , Josiah , '' she has promised magnificently , `` I 'll buy you a new suit of clothes . ''
26.2559	`` But , Maria , '' expostulated the meek husband , `` it will be left to me , not to you . ''
10.2623	`` Why so ? ''
9.8949	demanded she , frowning .
4.1108	`` Because he is my cousin , not yours . ''
8.8176	`` You indeed ! ''
4.5404	retorted the wife , angrily ; `` and what do you know about the use of money ?
3.5796	Who supports the family , I should like to know ? ''
11.6309	`` I help , '' answered Josiah , meekly .
1.5252	`` And precious little you help , '' returned his wife , sarcastically .
9.3529	`` So far as you are concerned , we should all be in the poor house long before this .
7.0719	No , Josiah , the money must come into my hands .
18.9223	I 'll give you a good allowance , and hire an errand boy so that you need n't have to carry round bundles .
6.7500	You ought to be contented with that . ''
13.9080	As no legacy had yet been received , Mr. Pinkerton thought it best not to continue the discussion .
23.8264	Indeed , he was rather afraid of his imperious wife , who held the reins of authority , and whom he did not dare to dispute .
493.6935	The two other relations were , first , a brown-faced and brown-handed farmer , Alonzo Granger , and an old lady , of seventy or thereabouts -- Miss Nancy Carter , a sister of the deceased .
29.6107	For years she had lived on a small pension from her brother , increased somewhat by knitting stockings for the neighbors .
5.9682	She , indeed , was the only real mourner .
49.9591	The rest were speculating about how far they were likely to be benefited by the death of the deceased , of whom they had seen but little in life .
80.4755	Even Herbert , though impressed by the presence of death , could hardly be expected to feel deep grief for a man who had neglected his mother in his life .
6.3465	Of the funeral rites it is unnecessary to speak .
8.2347	We are interested in what came afterwards .
216.0435	The relations were quietly notified to meet at five o'clock in the office of Mr. Spencer , the lawyer , to whom had been intrusted the will of the late Mr. Carter .
19.0725	Those who have even a slight knowledge of human nature will not need to be told that the attendance of all was punctual .
9.6235	There was an anxious , expectant look on the faces of all -- not even excepting the old lady .
31.7793	She knew that if her brother had made no provision for her , she must go to the alms-house , and against this her honest pride revolted .
16.3683	She was willing to live on anything , however little , if she might live independently , as she had hitherto done .
9.9339	To feel herself dependent on public charity would indeed have been a hard trial for the poor old lady .
9.8225	Of all , probably Mrs. Pinkerton was the most confident .
166.0024	She had come to feel that her family was entitled to a large share of the estate , and she had gone so far as to decide just how she would invest it , and what new arrangements she would make , for she had no idea of consulting her husband on the subject .
42.1119	The lawyer was a gentlemanly-looking man , whose face inspired confidence in his integrity -- a remark which , unhappily , can not be made of all in his profession .
20.5697	He took his seat at a table , and produced the will , which he considerately commenced reading at once .
88.2916	After the usual introduction , the will proceeded thus : `` To my sister Nancy I give the use of my house , rent free , as long as she shall live .
183.8347	I leave her also an income of two hundred dollars a year , which , as her wants are small , will be sufficient to maintain her in comfort . ''
7.8947	The old lady breathed a sigh of relief .
9.4661	Her fears were removed .
18.5315	She could continue to live as she had been accustomed to do , and need not be beholden to private or public charity .
17.0545	Mrs. Pinkerton was not so well pleased .
3.2780	She felt almost as if she had been deprived of what belonged to her by right .
47.1346	She frowned at Miss Nancy , but the old lady was unconscious of the displeasure excited in the bosom of her imposing-looking relative .
321.2660	The lawyer proceeded : `` To my cousin , Alonzo Granger , I leave one hundred dollars ; not because he needs it , for I understand that he is well-to-do , but as a mark of remembrance . ''
0.2326	The farmer scowled slightly , and opened and closed his brown hands in dissatisfaction .
1.7792	He was well-to-do ; but when was a man ever satisfied with that ?
5.2044	He had counted upon a few thousands , with which he proposed to buy an adjoining farm .
14.7459	Mrs. Pinkerton , however , was pleased .
6.8101	There was so much the more for her .
349.5900	`` To Cornelius Dixon '' -- here Herbert 's morning acquaintance began to feel excited -- `` I bequeath one hundred dollars , to buy a looking-glass and a new suit of clothes . ''
110.7743	The young man 's face lengthened very perceptibly as he heard the small amount of his legacy , and he glared savagely at Mrs. Pinkerton , who showed a mirthful face at his discomfiture .
10.1954	Her turn came next .
309.1969	`` To Josiah Pinkerton , his wife and children , I leave one hundred dollars apiece ; also my best black pantaloons , which he or his wife may appropriate , as may be arranged between them . ''
131.0519	All except the Pinkertons laughed at this sly hit , and even the lawyer smiled ; but the stout lady flushed with rage and disappointment , and ejaculated : `` Abominable ! ''
10.2518	The eyes of all were now directed to Herbert , who was the only one remaining .
0.2484	Could it be possible that the balance of the property was left to him ?
6.6812	The fear of this made him the focus of unfriendly eyes , and he became restive and anxious .
53.9449	`` To my namesake , Herbert Carter , I leave a black trunk which I keep in my room , with all that it contains .
5.6668	To his mother I direct that the sum of one hundred dollars be paid . ''
2.9161	This was not much , but it was more than Herbert had expected .
529.3899	He knew how welcome even one hundred dollars would be to his mother , and he looked satisfied -- the only one of the party , except the old lady , who showed any pleasure at the contents of the will .
10.8987	The relatives looked bewildered .
21.0166	All had been mentioned in turn , and yet but a small part -- a very small part -- of the estate had been disposed of .
18.1519	Mrs. Pinkerton bluntly expressed the general curiosity .
7.7254	`` Who 's to have the rest , Mr. Spencer ? ''
10.2759	she demanded .
1.3038	`` I 'm coming to that , '' answered the lawyer , quietly .
463.7653	`` All the rest and residue of my property , of whatever kind , I leave to the town of Randolph , to establish a high school , directing that not more than twenty thousand dollars be expended upon the building , which shall be of brick .
166.3090	I desire that the school shall be known as the Carter School , to the end that my name may be remembered in connection with what I hope will prove a public blessing . ''
7.4670	`` That is all , '' said the lawyer , and he laid down the will upon the table .
11.2283	There was silence for a minute after the will was read .
9.1833	Mrs. Pinkerton fanned herself furiously , and looked angry and excited .
25.6971	At length she said : `` I wish to say that that is a very unjust will , Mr. Spencer . ''
8.9473	`` I am not responsible for it , Mrs. Pinkerton , '' answered the lawyer , quietly .
60.6563	`` I do n't know what the rest of you think , '' said the angry lady , with a general glance around the office , `` but I think the will ought to be broken . ''
9.0473	`` On what grounds ? ''
20.9286	asked Mr. Spencer .
25.9017	`` He had no right to put off his own flesh and blood with a beggarly pittance , and leave all his money to the town . ''
89.9987	`` Pardon me ; whatever you may think of Mr. Carter 's will , there is no doubt that he had a perfect legal right to dispose of it as he did . ''
3.2603	`` Then the laws ought to be altered , '' said Mrs. Pinkerton , angrily .
0.2001	`` I do n't believe he was sane when he made the will . ''
18.4999	`` If you can prove that , '' said the lawyer , `` you can set aside the will ; but not otherwise . ''
0.4842	`` My brother was in his right mind , '' here interposed Miss Nancy .
1.4592	`` He always meant to give the town money for a school . ''
20.5555	`` No doubt you think he was sane , '' sneered Mrs. Pinkerton , turning upon the old lady .
4.3901	`` You have fared better than any of us . ''
31.7831	`` Miss Nancy was most nearly related to the deceased , '' said the lawyer , `` and she needed help most . ''
24.9705	`` It 's all very well to talk , '' said the lady , tossing her head , `` but me and mine have been badly used .
25.9533	I have hard work enough to support the family , and little help I get from him , '' she added , pointing to her unhappy husband .
5.3501	`` I 'm workin ' all the time , '' remonstrated Josiah .
13.1521	`` You are unkind , Maria . ''
48.6170	`` I could hire a boy to do all your work for three dollars a week , '' she retorted .
6.1034	`` That 's all you help me .
253.8332	I 've worried along for years , expectin ' Mr. Carter would do something handsome for us ; and now he 's put us off with four hundred dollars . ''
10.8400	`` I get only one hundred , '' said the farmer .
7.7595	`` And I , too .
12.9437	It 's a beastly shame , '' remarked Cornelius .
22.3482	`` Really , '' said the lawyer , `` it appears to me unseemly to speak so bitterly so soon after the funeral . ''
6.1952	`` I dare say you like it well enough , '' said Mrs. Pinkerton , sharply .
2.4567	`` You 've got all our money to build a schoolhouse . ''
5.2805	`` It will not benefit me any more than the townspeople generally , '' said the lawyer .
26.0542	`` For my part , I should have been glad if my late friend had left a larger sum to those connected with him by blood . ''
3.6471	`` Do n't you think we could break the will ? ''
19.9213	asked Mrs. Pinkerton , persuasively .
6.6574	`` Could n't you help us ? ''
8.9496	`` You can attempt it , but I assure you in advance you have n't the ghost of a chance .
1.6195	You would only lose your money , for the town would strenuously oppose you . ''
9.1458	The stout lady 's face fell .
7.1793	She felt that the last hope was gone .
7.2309	`` All I can say is , that it 's a scandalous thing , '' she concluded , bitterly .
70.7201	`` I should like to know what 's in that trunk he left you , '' said Cornelius Dixon , turning to Herbert .
7.6136	`` Maybe it 's money or bonds .
4.6778	If it is , do n't forget our agreement . ''
16.9968	This drew attention to Herbert .
41.2983	`` To be sure , '' said Mrs. Pinkerton , whose curiosity was aroused , `` Mr. Dixon may be right .
2.4372	Suppose we all go over to the house and open it . ''
25.2967	Herbert looked irresolutely toward the lawyer .
2.9230	`` There is no objection , I suppose , '' said Mr. Spencer .
3.0431	`` I know what 's in the trunk , '' said Miss Nancy .
8.0813	Straightway all eyes were turned upon her .
7.4882	`` What is it ? ''
8.8510	`` It 's clothes .
4.5282	My brother used to keep his clothes in that trunk . ''
26.6694	Cornelius Dixon burst into a rude laugh .
7.2576	`` I say , Herbert , I congratulate you , '' he said , with a chuckle .
6.5279	`` The old fellow 's left you his wardrobe .
4.1165	You 'll look like a peacock when you put 'em on .
4.4918	If you ever come to New York to see me , leave 'em at home .
4.9914	I would n't like to walk up Broadway with such a gawk as you 'd look . ''
58.2021	`` Young man , '' said Miss Nancy , her voice tremulous , `` it do n't look well in you to ridicule my poor departed brother .
7.7056	He did n't forget you . ''
12.5662	`` He might as well , '' muttered Cornelius .
36.0509	`` I hope you wo n't laugh at my brother 's gift , '' said the old lady , turning to Herbert .
9.5897	`` No , ma'am , '' said Herbert , respectfully .
7.0983	`` I am glad to get it .
7.2433	I ca n't afford to buy new clothes often , and they can be made over for me . ''
6.7909	`` You would n't catch me wearing such old-fashioned duds , '' said Cornelius , scornfully .
58.6013	`` No one asked you to , young man , '' said the old lady , disturbed at the manner in which her brother was spoken of .
8.7788	`` The boy 's worth a dozen of you . ''
6.2887	`` Thank you , '' said Cornelius , bowing with mock respect .
15.7648	`` I should like to ask , '' he continued , turning to the lawyer , `` when I can get my legacy .
1.3361	It is n't much , but I might as well take it . ''
151.0731	`` As the amount is small , I will send you a check next week , '' said Mr. Spencer , `` if you will leave me your address . ''
4.2456	`` And can I have my money , too ? ''
21.4051	demanded Mrs. Pinkerton .
6.9564	`` It 's a miserable pittance , but I owe it to my poor children to take it . ''
4.4183	`` I will send your husband a check also , next week , madam . ''
5.8344	`` You need n't send it to him .
3.5433	You may send it to me , '' said the lady .
1.9787	`` Part of it is mine , '' expostulated the husband , in meek deprecation .
2.4832	`` I can give you your part , '' said his wife .
2.7479	`` Mr. Spencer , you may make the check payable to me . ''
8.7235	`` But , Maria -- '' `` Be silent , Josiah !
5.2206	Do n't make a fool of yourself , '' said his wife , in an imperious tone .
161.8564	The poor man was fain to be silent , but the lawyer was indignant , and said : `` Mr. Pinkerton , I will certainly not pay your legacy , nor your children 's , to anyone but yourself .
56.8699	I will send Mrs. Pinkerton a check for her own share -- one hundred dollars -- since she desires it . ''
7.3296	`` I insist upon your sending me the children 's money also , '' said the lady angrily .
3.4139	`` He ai n't fit to take charge of it . ''
43.9223	`` You may insist as much as you like , Mrs. Pinkerton , '' said the lawyer , coolly , `` but it will be useless .
9.4394	As the head of the family , I shall send the money designed for the children to your husband . ''
3.7329	`` Do you call him the head of the family ? ''
19.6588	demanded the angry Maria .
9.4426	`` I would have you to know , sir , that I am the head of the family . ''
5.4710	`` The law does not recognize you as such .
15.6394	As to the pantaloons , which form a part of the legacy , I will forward them to you , if you wish . ''
5.0342	`` Do you mean to insult me , sir ? ''
11.7436	gasped Mrs. Pinkerton , growing very red in the face .
11.4648	`` Not at all ; but they were left either to you or your husband , as you might jointly agree . ''
91.5716	The lady was about to decline accepting them at all , but it occurred to her that they might be made over to suit her husband , and so save the expense of a new pair , and , she directed that they should be sent to him .
25.5131	Then , gathering her family about her , she strode majestically from the office , shaking off , metaphorically , the dust of her feet against it .
3.2367	Next Mr. Granger , after a few words with the lawyer , departed .
18.7248	Mr. Cornelius Dixon also announced that he must depart .
126.1054	`` Come and see me some time in the city , '' he said to Herbert , `` and if you ever get a windfall just put it into my hands , and I 'll go into business with you . ''
38.9690	`` I 'll remember , '' said Herbert , `` but I 'm afraid it 'll be a good while before that . ''
6.7775	`` I do n't know about that .
8.4438	You can open a second-hand clothing store .
4.4837	The old man 's left you a good stock in trade .
8.1763	Good joke , is n't it ?
15.8228	Good-by . ''
9.9595	Next Miss Nancy rose to go .
18.7811	`` Tell your mother to call and see me , my boy , '' she said , kindly , to Herbert .
4.3166	`` I wish my brother 'd left her more , for I know she needs it . ''
21.0515	`` Thank you , Miss Nancy , '' said Herbert , respectfully ; `` but we do n't complain .
5.7459	We are thankful for what we have received . ''
1.6300	`` You 're the best of 'em , '' said the old lady , earnestly .
1.3395	`` You 're a good boy , and God will prosper you . ''
7.7616	She went out , and of the eight heirs Herbert alone remained .
15.5892	The lawyer regarded Herbert with a smile .
4.5724	`` Your uncle 's will does n't seem to have given general satisfaction , '' he said .
24.2396	`` No , '' responded Herbert ; `` but for my part I have come out as well as I expected . ''
10.0474	`` I suppose you know Mr. Carter was rich ? ''
7.0985	`` So my mother told me . ''
5.8956	`` How much do you think he was worth ? ''
16.3659	Herbert was rather surprised at this question .
7.8738	Why should the lawyer ask it , when of course he knew much more about the matter ?
4.6747	`` About a hundred thousand dollars , I suppose , '' he answered .
8.3885	`` You are not far wrong .
24.2873	Now does n't your share , and your mother 's , seem very small compared with this large amount ? ''
2.7199	`` It is very small compared with that , but we had no claim to anything .
2.5411	The clothes and the money will be very useful to us . ''
296.2583	`` You are a model heir , '' said Mr. Spencer , smiling `` You alone do not find fault , except , of course , Miss Nancy , who has fared the best . ''
27.5137	`` I would rather make a fortune for myself than inherit one from another , '' said Herbert , sturdily .
14.0503	`` I respect your independence , my boy , '' said the lawyer , who felt favorably disposed toward our hero .
4.7186	`` Still , a legacy is n't to be despised .
7.6404	Now tell me when you want to take your trunk . ''
3.0242	`` I want to ask your advice about that , '' said Herbert .
15.3147	`` I walked over from Wrayburn .
8.5384	How shall I carry the trunk back ? ''
58.2246	`` You will have to return by the stage to-morrow morning , that is , if you are ready to go back so soon . ''
6.5015	`` Do they charge much to stop overnight at the hotel ? ''
5.1181	asked Herbert , anxiously , for he had but seventy-five cents with him .
66.1867	It occurred to him how foolish he had been not to consider that it would be necessary for him to spend the night in Randolph .
7.8475	`` I do n't know exactly how much .
12.6262	I think they charge fifty cents for a bed , and the same for each meal . ''
11.6865	Herbert 's face lengthened , and he became alarmed .
4.7197	How was he going to manage , on his limited resources ?
7.0588	The lawyer penetrated his perplexity , and , being a kind-hearted man , quickly came to his relief .
88.5841	`` I think you would find it lonely at the hotel , my boy , '' he said , `` and I shall therefore invite you to pass the night at my house instead . ''
20.1165	`` You are very kind , sir , '' said Herbert , gratefully , finding his difficulty happily removed .
6.5922	`` I accept your invitation with pleasure . ''
13.8434	`` The boy has been well brought up , if he is poor , '' thought Mr. Spencer .
2.9341	`` Well , '' he said , `` that is settled .
13.2254	I think our supper must be ready , so we will go over to the house at once .
0.1927	By the way , there is a boy from your town visiting my son .
7.9142	You must know him ? ''
22.2095	`` Is it James Leech ? ''
17.2864	asked Herbert , remembering what James had told him .
9.2169	`` Yes .
7.8209	Do you know him ? ''
8.1615	`` We are schoolmates . ''
3.5356	`` Then it will be pleasant for you to meet . ''
4.0280	Herbert was not quite sure about this , but forbore to say so .
59.2488	He accompanied Mr. Spencer to his house , which was just across the street from the office , and followed the lawyer into an apartment handsomely furnished .
0.9504	James Leech and Tom Spencer were sitting at a small table , playing checkers .
14.3412	`` Hello , Carter ! ''
6.5884	exclaimed James , in surprise , `` how came you here ? ''
16.7626	`` Mr. Spencer invited me , '' said Herbert , not surprised at the mode of address .
6.6810	`` Did your uncle leave you anything ? ''
17.3781	asked James , with interest .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
12.1843	`` How much ? ''
14.3829	`` He left my mother a hundred dollars . ''
7.1332	`` That is n't much , '' said James , contemptuously .
8.2152	`` Was that all ? ''
1.1120	`` No , he left me a trunk , and what is in it . ''
7.2214	`` What is in it ? ''
7.5249	`` Clothes , I believe . ''
8.3225	`` A lot of old clothes ! ''
15.1339	commented James , turning up his nose .
3.4105	`` That 's a fine legacy , I must say . ''
5.1918	`` I shall find them useful , '' said Herbert , quietly .
8.3595	`` Oh , no doubt .
9.2977	You can roll up the pants and coat-sleeves .
1.8749	It will be fun to see you parading round in your uncle 's tailcoats . ''
7.1861	`` I do n't think you 'll have that pleasure , '' said Herbert , flushing .
0.1694	`` If I wear them I shall have them made over for me . ''
6.0819	`` I congratulate you on your new and extensive wardrobe , '' said James , mockingly .
3.9069	`` Wo n't you cut a dash , though , on the streets of Wrayburn ! ''
10.8574	Herbert did not deign a reply to this rude speech .
25.8147	Tom Spencer , who was much more of a gentleman than James , was disgusted with his impertinence .
10.2069	He rose , and took Herbert by the hand .
3.2763	`` You must let me introduce myself , '' he said .
7.5285	`` My name is Thomas Spencer , and I am glad to see you here . ''
23.2221	`` Thank you , '' said Herbert , his heart opening at the frank and cordial manner of the other .
11.8358	`` My name is Herbert Carter , and I am very glad to make your acquaintance . ''
7.9414	`` Are you going to finish this game , Tom ? ''
10.9295	drawled James , not relishing the idea of Herbert 's receiving any attention from his friend .
11.0406	`` If you do n't mind , we 'll have it another time , '' said Tom .
0.5365	`` There goes the supper bell , and I for one am hungry . ''
45.4494	At the supper table James noticed , to his secret disgust , that Herbert was treated with as much consideration as himself .
10.5940	Mr. and Mrs. Spencer appeared to consider them social equals , which made James very uncomfortable .
6.5521	`` You boys are about of an age , I suppose , '' said Mr. Spencer .
5.2932	`` I really do n't know , '' said James , haughtily .
6.9265	`` You attend the same school ? ''
16.4552	`` Yes , '' said James , `` but I expect to go to some select academy very soon .
1.4249	At a public school you have to associate with all classes , you know . ''
6.3899	Mr. Spencer arched his brows , and steadily regarded the young aristocrat .
9.5967	`` I do n't see any great distinction of classes in a country village , '' said he , dryly .
4.4069	`` Besides , we are living in a republic . ''
50.0758	`` You would n't like to associate on equal terms with a day laborer , '' said James , pertly .
1.4841	`` I am a laborer myself , '' said the lawyer , smiling .
56.8898	`` I wish I could say I were a day laborer exclusively , but sometimes I have to work into the night . ''
0.3743	`` You are a professional man , and a gentleman , '' said James .
5.2298	`` You do n't work with your hands . ''
3.6172	`` I hope you boys will all grow up gentlemen , '' said Mr. Spencer .
8.2950	`` I shall , of course , '' said James .
12.4960	`` And you , Tom ? ''
8.3905	`` I hope so . ''
12.4960	`` And you , Herbert ? ''
87.8134	`` I hope so , too , '' said Herbert ; `` but if it is necessary to be rich to be a gentleman , I am not sure about it . ''
7.6011	`` What is your idea of a gentleman , James ? ''
10.3939	asked the lawyer .
6.0168	`` He must be of a good family , and wear good clothes , and live nicely . ''
10.0070	`` Is that all ? ''
6.8200	`` He ought to be well educated . ''
5.1317	`` I see you name that last which I should name first .
4.8814	So these constitute a gentleman , in your opinion ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
10.4237	`` Not always .
19.5803	I have known men combining all the qualifications you have mentioned , who were very far from being gentlemen , in my opinion . ''
9.5750	`` How is that , sir ? ''
19.3577	asked James , puzzled .
9.3336	`` They were arrogant , puffed up with an idea of their own importance , deficient in politeness . ''
13.1523	`` How well he has described James ! ''
0.4131	thought Herbert , but he was too much of a gentleman to say so .
14.3397	James looked disconcerted , and dropped the subject .
7.3068	He thought the lawyer had some queer ideas .
8.0033	Why need a gentleman be polite to his inferiors ?
5.3550	he thought , but he did n't say so .
9.1003	After supper the boys went out behind the house , and feasted on peaches , which were just ripe .
0.8172	Herbert found Tom very social , but James took very little notice of him .
5.3068	Our hero did not make himself unhappy on this account .
185.8229	In fact , he was in unusual good spirits , and enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure of going back to Wrayburn with the welcome news of the two legacies .
21.2671	About half past seven Mr. Spencer came out into the orchard .
145.5374	`` As the stage starts early in the morning , Herbert , '' he said , `` we had better go over and get the trunk ready , so that you can take it home . ''
103.4258	James Leech hoped to receive an invitation to accompany the two ; but no invitation was given , and he was forced to content himself with staying behind .
37.7199	Mr. Spencer entered the house so lately vacated by the old man who had occupied it for forty years .
10.0536	`` The trunk is in your uncle 's room , '' said the lawyer , `` or ought to be .
6.3650	I suppose it has not been moved . ''
16.9178	The two entered the chamber .
127.3845	It was a small , poorly furnished apartment , covered with a carpet which , cheap in the first place , was so worn with use that the bare floor showed in spots .
3.8862	`` Your uncle was not very luxurious in his taste , '' said Mr. Spencer .
9.6061	`` There are plenty of day laborers in town who have as good rooms as this . ''
9.2790	`` I suppose he liked laying up money better than spending it , '' said Herbert .
8.8803	`` You are right there .
7.6459	This must be the trunk . ''
1.7986	It was a small , black hair trunk , studded with brass nails .
3.1534	Mr. Spencer took a bunch of keys from his pocket and unlocked it .
6.8798	Lifting the cover he exposed to view a collection of woolen clothes-coats , vests , and pants .
4.9521	`` This is your legacy , Herbert , '' said the lawyer .
4.4007	`` I am afraid you wo n't find it very valuable .
8.3066	What is this ? ''
3.0935	He drew out , and held up to view , a blue cloak of ample proportions .
7.5453	`` Will you try it on ? ''
9.4877	he said , smiling .
36.3846	Herbert threw it over his shoulders , and looked at himself in a small seven-by-nine looking-glass which was suspended over the washstand .
7.0923	It came down nearly to his feet .
24.3810	`` I should hardly dare to wear this without alteration , '' he said ; `` but there is a good deal of good cloth in it .
1.5216	Mother can cut a coat and vest out of it for me . ''
6.8409	`` Here is a blue coat with brass buttons .
6.2555	I remember your uncle used to wear it to church twenty years ago .
7.6958	Of late years he has not attended , and has had no occasion to wear it .
0.2190	Here is a pair of pantaloons ; but they are pretty well worn . ''
4.1746	So they went through the list , finding little of value .
8.4898	The last article was a vest .
13.4770	`` It seems heavy , '' said Herbert .
5.2607	The lawyer took it from him and examined it .
2.4788	`` There seems to be an inside pocket , '' he said .
5.8292	`` There must be something in it . ''
44.1297	The pocket was confined by a button ; Mr. Spencer thrust his fingers inside , and drew out something loosely enveloped in brown paper .
7.9048	`` What have we here ? ''
6.5044	he said , in a tone of curiosity .
9.9403	The secret was speedily solved .
48.1875	When the paper was opened , it was found to contain five gold eagles , and two dollars in silver coins .
8.6156	Herbert 's eyes glistened with delight as he viewed the treasure .
23.3437	`` Fifty-two dollars ! ''
10.5460	he exclaimed .
7.3006	`` And it is mine . ''
11.1256	`` Undoubtedly .
2.6641	The will expressly says you are to have the trunk , and all it contains . ''
10.6281	`` I wonder whether Uncle Herbert remembered this money ? ''
6.5302	`` We ca n't tell as to that , but it does n't affect your title to the money .
14.3110	I congratulate you , Herbert . ''
5.0008	`` It will do us a great deal of good .
17.8746	Then there are the hundred dollars for mother .
7.9019	Why , we shall be rich . ''
5.7357	`` Then you are content with your legacy ? ''
20.9286	asked Mr. Spencer .
3.9473	`` Oh , yes ; it was more than I expected , or mother , either . ''
9.1802	`` Yet it is but a mere drop of your uncle 's wealth , '' said the lawyer , thoughtfully .
0.1715	`` That may be ; but he need n't have left us anything . ''
3.7355	`` I see you look upon it in the best way .
34.3217	You are quite a model heir -- very different from most of your relatives -- Mrs. Pinkerton , for instance . ''
4.7426	`` I supposed she expected more than I did . ''
4.7157	`` She appeared to expect the bulk of the property .
89.7825	I am afraid her husband will have a hard time of it for a week to come , '' said the lawyer , laughing .
3.7568	`` He will have to bear the brunt of her disappointment .
3.7451	Well , there seems no more for us to do here .
3.0431	We have found out the value of your legacy , and may lock the trunk again .
69.3271	If you will lend a hand , we will take it across to my house , so that there may be no delay when the stage calls in the morning . ''
8.5848	`` All right , sir . ''
85.6306	James Leech was looking out of the front window , awaiting the return of Mr. Spencer and Herbert with not a little curiosity .
9.1530	At length he spied them .
10.1324	`` Tom ! ''
0.4358	he exclaimed , `` your father and that Carter boy are coming back . ''
13.6132	`` Why do you call him that Carter boy ?
14.9073	Why do n't you call him Herbert ? ''
3.0840	`` I am not on intimate terms with him , '' said James .
0.1801	`` That is strange , as you both live in the same village . ''
15.7501	`` You must remember that there is some difference in our social positions , '' said James , haughtily .
0.3856	`` That is something I never think of , '' said Tom , candidly .
7.1129	`` I am a genuine republican . ''
12.0991	`` I am not , '' said James .
0.3972	`` I should like to live in England , where they have noblemen . ''
1.4411	`` Not unless you could be a nobleman yourself , I suppose ? ''
6.8836	`` No ; of course not . ''
4.7426	By this time Mr. Spencer and Herbert were bringing the trunk into the front entry .
62.5441	`` I should n't think a professional gentleman like your father would like to be seen carrying a trunk across the street , '' said James .
8.1340	`` Oh , he do n't care for that ; nor should I , '' said Tom .
18.7004	Herbert entered the room .
14.0007	`` Well , Herbert , what luck ? ''
20.4206	asked Tom .
10.1984	`` Better than I expected , '' said Herbert , gayly .
6.9051	`` What do you say to that ? ''
7.2763	and he displayed the gold and silver .
8.6822	`` How much is it ? ''
8.3555	asked James , his vanity melting under the influence of curiosity .
23.3437	`` Fifty-two dollars . ''
9.7117	`` Capital ! ''
19.8725	said Tom .
3.3723	`` It is n't much , '' said James , in a tone of depreciation .
45.5513	`` I 'll bet Herbert is richer than you , James , '' said Tom , in a lively manner .
5.7666	`` Can you show as much money as that ? ''
24.6333	`` I shall be a rich man some day , '' said James , with an air of importance .
7.6907	`` Your father may fail . ''
3.3169	`` The moon may be made of green cheese , '' retorted James , loftily .
10.4381	`` How about the clothes ?
7.3900	Are you going to show them ? ''
12.8377	`` I think not , '' said Herbert .
6.5741	`` A parcel of rags , I suppose , '' said James , with a sneer .
3.5366	`` Not quite so bad as that , '' responded Herbert , good-naturedly .
6.6842	`` Still , I think I shall hardly venture to wear any of them without alteration . ''
24.0400	`` I would n't wear second-hand clothes , '' remarked James Leech , in his usual amiable tone .
0.3857	`` Perhaps you would if you were poor , '' said Herbert , quietly .
6.5864	`` But I am not poor . ''
8.4169	`` Fortunately for you . ''
6.7015	`` Then you wo n't show the clothes ?
0.7376	I suppose they look as if they were made in the year one . ''
15.7664	`` For our forefather Adam ? ''
19.3982	suggested Tom , laughing .
36.4355	`` I am inclined to think the old gentleman in question had n't clothes enough to fill a trunk as large as that . ''
24.3708	`` Probably not , '' said Herbert ; `` he had no uncle , you know , to leave any to him . ''
2.9437	`` What are you going to do with your money , Carter ? ''
6.2703	asked James , whose curiosity got the better of his dignity occasionally .
5.5129	`` I have n't made up my mind yet .
4.0020	I think I shall find plenty of uses for it . ''
0.3687	`` What would you do with it if you had it , James ? ''
20.4206	asked Tom .
5.3434	`` I can have more if I want to .
7.2204	I have only to ask father . ''
33.2965	`` Then you 're better off than I. Say , father , will you give me fifty-two dollars ? ''
7.7181	`` When you are twenty-one I may do it . ''
13.4781	`` You see , '' said Tom .
6.2151	`` But you have n't answered my question .
2.7885	What would you do with the money if you had it ? ''
6.0889	`` I think I would buy a new rowboat ; there 's a pond near our house . ''
2.7513	`` When you get it send for me , and I 'll help you row . ''
4.3121	`` Very well , '' said James ; but he did not answer very positively .
38.2162	In fact , he was by no means sure that his father would comply with his request for money , although it suited him to make this representation to his companions .
21.0057	Herbert retired early .
432.3286	It had been a fatiguing day for him , and it would be necessary to rise in good season the next day , as the coach left Randolph for Wrayburn at an early hour .
21.5540	Mrs. Carter awaited Herbert 's return with interest .
14.4734	She felt lonely without him , for he had never before been away from home to stay overnight .
6.7444	But there was a feeling of anticipation besides .
24.3360	Her hopes of a legacy were not very strong , but of course there was a possibility of her uncle 's having remembered them in his will .
12.4024	`` Even if it is only five dollars , it will be welcome , '' she thought .
0.2116	`` Where people are so poor as we are , every little helps . ''
3.2143	She sat at her sewing when the stage stopped before the door .
20.2799	`` I 'm glad he rode home , '' thought the widow ; `` the walk both ways would have been too fatiguing . ''
15.8766	`` But why does not Herbert come in at once ? ''
6.0097	He had gone behind the coach , and the driver was helping him take down a trunk .
7.4730	`` Where did he get it ? ''
8.3942	thought his mother , in surprise .
5.7325	`` I guess you can get it into the house yourself , '' she heard the driver say .
6.0247	`` Yes , I 'll manage it ; you need n't wait , '' said Herbert .
1.7328	The driver cracked his whip , and the lumbering old coach drove on .
31.0483	`` Oh , there you are , mother , '' said Herbert , looking toward the house for the first time .
11.5035	`` I 'll be with you in a minute . ''
2.8842	And he began to draw the trunk in through the front gate .
10.3129	`` Where did you get that trunk , Herbert ? ''
21.1058	asked Mrs. Carter .
2.3998	`` Oh , it 's my legacy , '' said Herbert , laughing .
7.7516	`` Here it is , '' and he lifted it up , and laid it down in the front entry .
8.7516	`` What is inside ? ''
8.1564	asked his mother , with natural curiosity .
10.7515	`` It is n't full of gold and silver , mother , so do n't raise your expectations too high .
12.4274	It contains some clothes of Uncle Herbert , out of which you can get some for me . ''
1.5123	`` I am glad of that , for you need some new clothes .
4.5100	Well , we were not forgotten , after all . ''
5.8508	`` You do n't seem disappointed , mother . ''
19.6565	`` I might have wished for a little money besides , Herbert ; but beggars can not be choosers . ''
5.3966	`` But sometimes they get what they wish for .
13.6567	Uncle Herbert left you a legacy of a hundred dollars . ''
21.5118	`` A hundred dollars ! ''
19.2229	said Mrs. Carter , brightly .
3.7747	`` Why , that will be quite a help for us .
7.3875	Was it left to me ? ''
6.1826	`` Yes , to you . ''
7.0151	`` It was kind in your uncle .
10.4285	My legacy is more than yours , Herbert . ''
1.4061	`` I do n't know about that , mother ; look here ! ''
14.6100	And Herbert displayed his gold and silver .
0.6027	`` Here are fifty-two dollars that I found in the pocket of a vest .
12.4753	It belongs to me , for the will says expressly that I am to have the trunk and all it contains . ''
2.7508	`` I am really glad , '' said his mother , joyfully .
7.1003	`` We are more fortunate than I expected .
6.0023	Sit down and tell me all about it .
7.3312	Who got the bulk of the property ? ''
9.0071	`` None of the relations .
44.1879	It is bequeathed to the town of Randolph , to found a high school , to be called the Carter School . ''
3.2922	`` Well , it will do good , at any rate .
6.9480	Did n't the other relations receive legacies ? ''
2.9397	`` Small ones ; but they did n't seem very well satisfied .
17.2400	Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Pinkerton ? ''
13.0863	`` Slightly , '' said Mrs. Carter , smiling .
7.4392	`` Were they there ? ''
3.0712	`` She was , and he was in attendance upon her .
3.7125	She did n't give him a chance to say much . ''
4.0877	`` I have always heard she kept him in good subjection .
10.1236	How did they fare ? ''
12.8505	`` They and their two children received a hundred dollars apiece .
5.9776	She was mad and wanted to break the will .
37.9004	Then there was a Mr. Granger , a farmer , who got the same ; and Cornelius Dixon , also . ''
9.5342	`` I hope Aunt Nancy fared better .
5.2992	She is the best of them all . ''
171.1289	`` She is allowed to occupy the house , rent free , and is to have an income of two hundred dollars a year as long as she lives . ''
7.0261	`` I am really glad to hear it , '' said Mrs. Carter , with emphasis .
7.6953	`` She deserves all her good fortune .
107.7817	One of the best things her brother did in life was to allow her such an income as to keep her independent of public charity ; I feared he would forget to provide for her . ''
7.8840	`` She seems a good old lady .
2.3273	She asked me to invite you to call and see her . ''
36.5616	`` I should like to do so , and if I ever have occasion to go to Randolph I will certainly do so . ''
127.4050	`` Now , mother , '' said Herbert , when he had answered his mother 's questions , `` I want you to take this money , and use it as you need . ''
5.2156	`` But , Herbert , it was left to you . ''
1.3049	`` And if you use it I shall receive my share of it .
38.7989	By the way , your money will be sent you next week ; so Mr. Spencer assured me . ''
16.5018	`` Who is Mr. Spencer ? ''
8.0483	`` The lawyer who read the will .
8.0219	He was very kind to me .
12.4235	It was at his house I spent the night .
5.8365	I got acquainted with his son , Tom , a fine fellow .
4.6739	I met also James Leech , whom I can not compliment so highly .
15.6032	He was visiting Tom . ''
6.0391	`` I never thought him an agreeable boy . ''
7.6761	`` Nor anyone else , I expect .
22.8210	He appears to think he can put on airs , and expects everybody to bow down to him because his father is a rich man . ''
6.2571	`` I hope you did n't quarrel with him , '' said Mrs. Carter , apprehensively .
24.5138	`` Oh , no , he sneered at me , as usual , and drew a ridiculous picture of my appearance with my uncle 's clothes on . ''
5.9667	`` Do you mind what he says ? ''
9.6043	asked his mother , anxiously .
23.6601	`` A little , '' said Herbert , `` but I can stand it if he does n't go too far . ''
8.0200	`` He has an unhappy nature .
1.6857	I think his father must have been somewhat like him when he was young . ''
8.9676	`` So do I .
16.2916	He feels just as important as James .
3.3677	I like to see him strut round , as if he owned the whole village . ''
5.0687	`` He does own more of it than anyone else .
2.4692	Among the rest , he owns our house , in part . ''
2.4220	`` You mean he has a mortgage on it , mother ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
15.5850	`` Seven hundred and fifty dollars , is n't it ? ''
14.3412	`` Yes , Herbert . ''
6.1222	`` How much do you consider the whole worth ? ''
9.8312	asked our hero , thoughtfully .
22.9849	`` It cost your father fifteen hundred dollars .
96.7387	That is , the land -- nearly an acre -- cost three hundred dollars , and the house , to build , twelve hundred . ''
7.4055	`` Would it sell for that ? ''
92.2717	`` Not if a sale were forced ; but , if anybody wanted it , fifteen hundred dollars would not be too much to pay . ''
6.6449	`` I wish the mortgage were paid . ''
17.7809	`` So do I , my son ; but we are not very likely to be able to pay it . ''
317.3388	`` How fine it would have been if Uncle Herbert had left us , say eight hundred dollars , so that we might have paid it up , and still have had a little left for immediate use ! ''
37.3812	`` Yes , Herbert , it would have made us feel quite independent , but it is n't best speculating on what might have been .
1.5750	It is better to do the best we can with what we really have . ''
32.2351	`` I suppose you are right , mother ; but it is pleasant to dream of good fortune , even if we know it is out of reach . ''
1.5734	`` The trouble is , our dreaming often interferes with our working . ''
8.3164	`` It sha n't interfere with mine .
6.4584	I 've got something to work for . ''
8.1645	`` Do you refer to anything in particular , Herbert ? ''
9.2169	`` Yes .
3.1518	I want to pay off this mortgage , '' answered Herbert , manfully .
98.6853	`` Some day , when you are a man , you may be able ; but the time is too far off to spend much time upon it at present . ''
7.5528	Herbert had moved to the window as the conversation went on .
17.0225	Suddenly he called to his mother : `` Look , mother , there is Squire Leech riding up .
0.1768	He is pointing out our house to the man that is riding with him .
6.3527	Do you know who it is ? ''
6.5778	`` Yes , it is Mr. Banks , his new superintendent .
6.4200	He has just come into the village . ''
5.0094	`` I wonder why he pointed at our house ? ''
0.1785	`` Probably he was telling him that he had a mortgage on it . ''
5.4755	`` When does the interest come due on the mortgage ? ''
29.8944	`` Next week .
65.5094	I had only five dollars laid by to meet it , but , thanks to my legacy , I shall have no trouble in the matter . ''
0.3359	`` If you could n't pay the interest , could the squire foreclose ? ''
2.8169	`` Yes , that 's the law , I believe . ''
5.7903	`` And he would take advantage of it .
3.5710	But he never shall , if I can prevent it . ''
45.7732	Squire Leech lived in a large , square , white house , situated on an eminence some way back from the street .
86.3555	It had bay windows on either side of the front door , a gravel walk , bordered with flowers , leading to the gate , a small summerhouse on the lawn , and altogether was much the handsomest residence in the village .
50.1247	Three years before , the house , or , at all events , the principal rooms , had been newly furnished from the city .
10.7426	No wonder the squire and all the family held up their heads , and regarded themselves as belonging to the aristocracy .
299.9813	In a back room , used partly as a sitting room , partly as an office , the great man and his new superintendent , Amos Banks , were sitting , the evening previous to Herbert 's return home .
15.3839	It may be asked why Squire Leech needed a superintendent .
73.9880	To this I answer that his property , beside the home farm , included two outlying farms , which he preferred to carry on himself rather than let to tenants .
1.3713	Besides , he had stocks and bonds , to which he himself attended .
1.7658	But the farms required more attention than he individually was willing to bestow .
0.2129	Accordingly he employed a competent man , who had the general supervision of them .
33.8503	His former superintendent having emigrated to the West , he had engaged Mr. Banks , who had been recommended to him for the charge .
9.6388	Banks came from a town thirty miles distant , and had never lived in Wrayburn before .
4.9120	He had just entered upon his duties , and was talking over business matters with the squire .
6.4442	`` You will occupy the house on the Ross farm , '' said Squire Leech .
6.7119	`` I think you will find it comfortable .
5.6828	I have always reserved it for my superintendent . ''
3.1676	`` There is a house on the other farm , I suppose , '' said Banks .
3.4450	`` Yes ; but that is occupied by a family already .
12.6003	I do n't rent the farm , that is , except about half an acre of land for a kitchen garden .
5.9875	That I have prepared to cultivate myself . ''
8.0245	`` Precisely , '' said the superintendent .
6.8499	`` I will tell you why I inquired .
3.0114	You tell me there will be need of another permanent farm workman .
51.6922	Now I know an excellent man -- in fact , he is a cousin of my own -- who would be glad to accept the place . ''
10.4508	`` Very well .
1.4284	I have no objection to your engaging him , since you vouch for him . ''
19.5136	`` Oh , yes ; he is a faithful and industrious man , and he will be willing to do work for moderate wages .
3.1320	Indeed , he cares more for a permanent place than high pay .
36.0229	Where he is now , he is liable to be idle for some months in the year . ''
7.2638	`` Is he a family man ? ''
9.6129	`` Yes ; he has two young children . ''
10.0974	`` Of course he will move to Wrayburn . ''
4.6499	`` Yes ; if he can get a suitable house .
4.2141	In fact , that was what I was coming at .
1.4459	I thought of your other house , but you say that is already occupied . ''
6.2455	`` Yes ; and the family has occupied it for several years .
6.7501	I should not like to dislodge them . ''
1.5953	`` Do you know any other small house my cousin could rent ? ''
12.0421	Squire Leech reflected .
199.2080	`` The fact is , '' he said , after a pause , `` there has not been much building going on in Wrayburn for several years , and it is hard to find a vacant house . ''
7.6412	`` I am sorry for that .
8.2139	I am afraid it may interfere with Brown 's coming . ''
49.3495	`` There is one house , I think , that would just suit your cousin , '' said Squire Leech , slowly .
8.2807	`` Where is it ? ''
4.0315	`` It is now occupied by the widow Carter and her son . ''
7.5984	`` Is she going to move ? ''
6.7428	`` She would n't like to . ''
7.9218	`` Then how will that help us ?
9.1203	Who owns the house ? ''
5.6826	`` She does ; that is , nominally .
83.1247	I hold a mortgage on the place for seven hundred and fifty dollars , which is more than half the market value . ''
4.7347	`` Then it may eventually fall into your hands ? ''
10.7668	`` Very probably .
95.6572	Between ourselves , I think it probable that she will fail to be ready with the semi-annual interest , which comes due next week .
29.5984	She is quite poor -- has nothing but this property -- and has to sew for a living , or braid straw , neither of which pays well . ''
3.1808	`` Suppose she is not ready with the interest , do you propose to foreclose ? ''
8.5153	`` I think I shall .
135.8123	I will allow her three or four hundred dollars for her share of the property , and that will be the best thing she can do , in my opinion . ''
343.3881	Whether or not it would be the best thing for Mrs. Carter , it certainly would n't be a bad speculation for the squire , since the place , as already stated , was worth fully fifteen hundred dollars .
53.7078	How a rich man can deliberately plot to defraud a poor woman of a portion of her small property , you and I , my young reader , may find it hard to understand .
79.3051	Unfortunately there are too many cases in real life where just such things happen , so that there really seems to be a good deal of truth in the old adage that prosperity hardens the heart .
292.5472	If Mr. Banks had been a just or kind-hearted man , he would not have encouraged his employer in the plan he had just broached ; but he was selfish , and thought he saw in it an easy solution of the difficulty which he had met with in securing a house for his cousin .
55.6138	He did not know Mrs. Carter , and felt no particular interest in the question what was to become of her if she was ejected from her house .
7.1935	No doubt she would find a home somewhere .
5.2678	At any rate , it was not his business .
5.5982	`` It seems to me that will be an excellent plan , '' he said , with satisfaction .
5.2404	`` How soon can we find out about it ? ''
29.9881	`` Next week -- Tuesday .
6.0524	It is then that the interest comes due . ''
1.4686	`` Suppose she is ready to pay the interest , what then ? ''
51.1652	`` Then I will make her an offer for the place , and represent to her that it will be the better plan for her to part with it , and so escape the payment of interest .
128.4367	She has to pay forty-five dollars a year , and that is a great drain upon one who earns no more than she does . ''
0.2076	`` I think you said she had a son ; does he earn anything ?
6.8816	Or perhaps he is n't old enough . ''
57.2510	`` Yes , he is thirteen or fourteen ; still , there is n't much in a small village like this for a boy to do .
5.9892	He is attending school , I believe . ''
64.9222	`` Then , in one way or another , you think there is a good chance of our obtaining the house , '' said the superintendent , with satisfaction .
6.4164	`` Yes , I think so . ''
4.0196	`` How would it do to go around and speak to the widow about it beforehand ?
13.3336	I could then write to Brown . ''
32.9964	`` As to that , she may be very particular to retain the house , and even if she is not provided with the money , succeed in borrowing enough .
7.9607	Now , my idea is to say nothing about it till Tuesday .
23.0319	She may depend upon my waiting a few days .
10.2001	That I shall not do .
31.3935	If the money is not forthcoming I will foreclose at once , without giving her time to arrange for the money . ''
10.9886	The superintendent nodded .
7.1240	`` A very shrewd plan , Squire Leech , '' he said .
4.8617	`` By the way , where is the house situated ? ''
10.1112	`` Only a furlong up the road .
4.4024	It is on the opposite side of the way . ''
7.6092	`` I think I remember it .
2.5772	There is some land connected with it , is n't there ? ''
10.1235	`` Nearly an acre .
7.4904	The house is small , but neat .
1.5658	In fact , for a small place , I consider it quite desirable .
3.5182	Tomorrow we will ride by it , and you can take more particular notice . ''
15.2569	They did ride by , as we know , and Squire Leech pointed it out to his superintendent .
328.3007	Herbert noticed this , but he did not know that the two men had formed a scheme for turning his mother and himself out of their comfortable home , and defrauding his mother of a considerable portion of the small property which his father had left .
54.2894	Had he known this , it would have filled him with indignation , and he would have felt that even property is no absolute safeguard against the selfish schemes of the mercenary and the rapacious .
5.1929	Tuesday arrived , but as yet the check from Mr. Spencer had not been received .
78.6265	`` Never mind , mother , '' said Herbert , `` you will get it before the end of the week . ''
3.9111	`` But I shall need it to pay the interest to Squire Leech .
16.2054	He will call for it today . ''
8.6649	`` How much it is ? ''
18.3069	`` Twenty-two dollars and a half . ''
14.7301	`` You forget the gold I handed you last week . ''
14.3527	`` I do n't like to use it , Herbert ; I want you to use it for yourself . ''
0.2235	`` I am as much interested in paying the interest as you , mother .
8.3315	Do n't I occupy the house ? ''
72.9497	Seeing that Herbert was in earnest , Mrs. Carter overcame her scruples , and laid aside enough of the money to make up the amount required .
58.5358	About five minutes of twelve Squire Leech was seen advancing to the front door with slow , pompous steps .
7.0235	`` There he comes , mother ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
7.2885	`` I 'll open the door . ''
11.6946	`` Is your mother at home , Herbert ? ''
7.3837	asked the squire , in a dignified tone .
8.7962	`` Yes , sir .
7.9082	Wo n't you walk in ? ''
9.8588	`` Ahem , yes !
9.0335	I think I will .
4.5083	I have a little matter of business with her . ''
491.8994	Squire Leech entered the small sitting room , which seemed uncomfortably full when he was in it -- not on account of his size , but because he seemed so swollen with a sense of his own importance as to convey the idea that he was cramped for space -- very much like an owl in the cage of a canary .
14.1331	`` Good morning , Squire Leech , '' said the widow .
10.5745	`` Good morning , ma'am .
7.5907	I apprehend you know my errand . ''
6.9662	`` I suppose you come for the interest , Squire Leech . ''
8.9314	`` You are quite right .
5.3843	Of course you are prepared to pay it . ''
36.8998	Though the squire said `` of course , '' he by no means expected that it would be ready , nor , for reasons which we know , did he desire it .
36.6170	He was rather discomfited , therefore , when Mrs. Carter said : `` Did you bring a receipt with you , squire ? ''
8.5935	`` A receipt in full ? ''
10.2787	queried the great man .
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
8.8048	`` Are you prepared to pay the whole today ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
2.6320	This ought to have been gratifying intelligence , but it was not .
11.1384	The squire looked quite crestfallen .
1.3623	`` No , I did n't bring a receipt , '' he said , slowly .
5.4136	`` I 'll bring writing materials , '' said Herbert , promptly .
3.2033	He left the room , but appeared almost instantly with pen , ink , and paper .
7.3418	The squire sat down to the table with a disappointed air , and slowly wrote the required document .
34.6856	`` He seems sorry to receive the money , '' thought Herbert , who was quick in reading the faces of others .
9.1567	`` I wonder why ? ''
5.9864	and he gazed at the visitor in some perplexity .
2.8582	The squire received the money , and handed the widow the receipt .
7.4418	Still he did not seem inclined to go .
3.0126	He was thinking how to broach the subject of selling the house .
79.9926	`` Mrs. Carter , '' he began , `` forty-five dollars a year seems a good deal for you to pay . ''
1.2959	`` Yes , it is considerable , '' said the widow , surprised .
5.8161	Could it be that he intended to reduce the interest ?
8.0679	That did not seem like him .
6.8613	`` For one in your circumstances I mean , of course .
0.1807	You 've got to earn your own living , and your son 's . ''
9.5935	`` Herbert does his share , '' said the mother .
4.2298	`` When he is older I shall feel quite easy . ''
5.5663	`` But that time is a good way off .
55.9496	I 've been thinking of your case , Mrs. Carter , and as a man of business I see my way clear to offer you a little advice . ''
5.0185	`` I shall be thankful for any advice , squire , '' said the widow , meekly .
0.2324	`` Of course your judgment in business matters is much better than mine . ''
14.5879	Herbert listened to this conversation with eager interest .
7.9125	What could the squire mean to advise ?
25.0808	`` I 've been thinking , '' said the squire , deliberately , `` that it would be a good plan for you to sell this house . ''
7.5776	`` To sell it ! ''
17.6616	repeated Mrs. Carter , in surprise .
7.5275	`` But where could I live ? ''
2.7020	`` You might hire a couple of rooms for yourself and Herbert . ''
0.4509	`` I do n't see how mother would gain anything , '' interrupted Herbert .
6.3224	`` She would have to pay rent . ''
10.7249	`` Very true , but she would get some money down for the house , over and above the mortgage . ''
11.0462	`` I do n't know as anybody would want to buy it , '' said Mrs. Carter .
22.0136	`` I would take it off your hands , simply to oblige you , '' said the squire , with an air of extraordinary consideration .
1.3785	`` I do n't know that it would be of any particular use to me .
8.6620	I might not get a tenant .
4.4078	Still , I am better able to take the risk than you are to keep it . ''
3.6807	`` How much would you be willing to pay for it ? ''
29.7239	asked Herbert , who somehow suspected that the squire was more selfish than benevolent in the plan he had broached .
247.5537	`` Why , '' said Squire Leech , assuming a meditative look , `` over and above the mortgage , I would be willing to pay three hundred dollars cash . ''
49.9196	`` That would make the value of the place only ten hundred and fifty dollars , '' said Herbert .
2.7046	`` Well , you do n't consider it worth any more than that do you ? ''
0.8108	`` My husband considered it worth fifteen hundred dollars , '' said the widow .
7.5948	`` It cost him that . ''
11.3884	The squire laughed heartily .
5.4159	`` Really , my dear madam , that is utterly preposterous .
34.6070	Fifteen hundred dollars !
8.4499	Why , that is ridiculous . ''
9.4052	`` It cost that , '' said Herbert , sturdily .
4.1517	`` I very much doubt it , '' said the squire .
1.1348	`` I do n't believe it cost a cent over twelve hundred dollars . ''
24.9352	`` I have my husband 's papers to show that it cost fifteen hundred , '' said the widow .
6.9786	`` Then all I have to say is , he was outrageously cheated , '' said the squire .
13.2106	`` I believe I know as much about real estate as any man in town , '' he proceeded , pompously .
4.8278	`` Indeed , I own more than any other man .
4.4466	I assure you , on my word , I have offered you a very good price . ''
3.1016	`` I would rather not sell , '' said the widow , gently , but decidedly .
173.0757	`` I will increase my offer to eleven hundred , including the mortgage , '' said the squire , who saw the prize slipping through his fingers , and felt it necessary to bid higher .
31.1249	`` Eleven hundred dollars .
27.0487	That 's three hundred and fifty dollars cash ! ''
40.1249	`` Mother , I am sure you wo n't think of selling for any such sum , '' expostulated Herbert .
2.7964	`` No , '' said his mother , `` I do n't want to sell . ''
106.1215	`` You stand very much in your own light , ma'am , '' said the squire , impatiently ; `` and you , Herbert , are too young to offer any advice on such a subject . ''
5.2348	`` I do n't see why , '' said Herbert , independently .
5.2322	`` I ought to feel interested in such a matter .
4.0662	`` You are a boy , and have no judgment .
4.7312	Boys of your age should be seen and not heard , '' said the squire , sternly .
6.4113	`` I can see what is best for my mother 's interest , '' said Herbert .
5.5454	`` I decline to discuss the matter with you .
1.8461	I consider your interference impertinent , '' said the squire , becoming angry .
14.3412	`` Oh , Herbert ! ''
26.3629	said his mother , who was a little in awe of the great man of the village , `` be respectful to Squire Leech . ''
111.8641	`` I mean to be , '' said Herbert , `` but I 'm sure he 's wrong in thinking I have nothing to do with this matter . ''
15.1317	`` Reflect again , Mrs. Carter , '' persisted the squire , `` of the advantages of my proposal .
101.2027	Think how comfortable you would feel in knowing that you had three hundred and fifty dollars on interest in the savings bank .
37.4625	I admit that I may not offer you quite as much as the place cost , but houses never fetch their first cost .
0.2323	I 've made you a very fair offer , ma'am , very fair . ''
349.4632	`` I wo n't say anything as to that , Squire Leech , but this house my poor husband built -- in this house I have passed many happy years -- and while we can keep it , Herbert and I , we will .
1.6994	There is no other place in town that would seem so much like home . ''
33.5499	`` This is all very sentimental , ma'am ; but , permit me to say , very ridiculous , '' said the impatient squire , rising to go .
9.3131	`` I 'll give you time to think over what I have said , and I 'll call again . ''
7.7702	`` I 'll have that place yet , '' he muttered to himself , as he left the cottage .
1.6718	`` I wo n't be balked by an obstinate woman and an impertinent boy . ''
15.2891	Squire Leech was reluctant to give up his intended purchase .
510.9156	He had an idea that Herbert stood in the way , and he contrived to call upon the widow in the course of the following week , at a time when he knew our hero was away from home .
9.2976	But he failed again .
142.7416	`` I 'm very sorry to go contrary to your advice , Squire Leech , '' said Mrs. Carter , deprecatingly , `` but I ca n't give up my home .
10.2598	Herbert , too , would be very much disappointed . ''
33.6674	`` I hope you will not allow yourself to be guided by the judgment of an inexperienced boy , ma'am , '' said the squire , mortified .
3.5228	`` I think I ought to consult my boy 's wishes , '' said the widow .
3.3054	`` He does n't know what is best for him . ''
6.8523	`` Perhaps not ; but I feel with him at present .
13.5657	I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Squire Leech . ''
0.1738	`` As to that , ma'am , I have no interest in the matter .
5.3063	I was only advising you for your good . ''
3.7223	`` I 'm sure I 'm much obliged to you . ''
38.4114	`` In fact , as your means are limited , I will stretch a point , and offer you fifty dollars more .
1.6396	I should n't be at all sure of getting my money back . ''
3.0278	`` Thank you ; but I think we 'll keep the house for the present .
3.1458	If I should find we could n't afford it , I will let you know . ''
4.1173	`` I do n't agree to keep to my offer after this week .
12.3901	` Now or never ' is my motto .
7.3081	I can draw the papers right out . ''
1.7061	The widow shook her head , and reiterated in gentle tones her refusal .
10.8797	Squire Leech was provoked , and did not hide his feeling .
42.6319	As he only proposed to take the house to oblige her , as he represented , Mrs. Carter was surprised at his display of feeling .
19.5093	She was not a shrewd woman , and it did not occur to her that he had any selfish object in view in his advice .
6.8546	`` I did n't succeed , Mr. Banks , '' said the squire to his superintendent .
8.9000	`` That Carter woman is dreadfully obstinate .
1.3788	Between ourselves , I judge it 's her son that influences her . ''
3.6173	`` I think I have seen him -- a boy of fourteen or fifteen . ''
4.5485	`` Yes , he 's a very self-willed boy . ''
15.0943	`` You said you thought you would be able to foreclose , on account of their failing to pay the interest . ''
8.4515	`` They paid it .
104.2748	I was surprised at their promptness , till I learned from my son that they had received a legacy of a hundred dollars or so from a relative . ''
7.4127	`` That wo n't last always . ''
4.3121	`` No , the time will come when I can get the place on my own terms .
6.2616	I am determined to have it . ''
7.0739	`` Then Brown will have to find a different house . ''
27.5902	`` Yes ; I have heard of an old house that will do temporarily , till I get the widow Carter 's .
296.0482	It 's a little out of the village , and is in rather a dilapidated condition , but it will do for a few months or a year , and that will fetch round the Carters . ''
2.9540	The house referred to was secured , and the superintendent 's cousin moved to Wrayburn .
15.4772	But neither the squire nor Mr. Banks forgave Herbert for his assumed instrumentality in thwarting their plans .
75.1750	The next winter Mrs. Carter was unfortunate enough to be laid up with severe sickness from December to March .
6.0833	Herbert devoted himself to her comfort , and performed nearly all his mother 's customary work .
2.6498	Washing and ironing , however , he was obliged to have done .
412.3838	When the sickness commenced , the hundred dollars left by his uncle was unbroken , but for three months neither he nor , of course , his mother , was able to earn anything of any amount , while their expenses were necessarily increased .
77.3843	At the opening of April , Herbert had the satisfaction of seeing his mother , fully recovered , assume her usual place in the little household .
2.4202	This was pleasant , but there was a drawback to his satisfaction .
21.0913	The legacy had dwindled to twenty-five dollars .
7.3925	He reported this to his mother .
3.2813	`` How unlucky that I should have been sick so long ! ''
19.5164	said Mrs. Carter , sighing .
3.1115	`` How lucky we had the legacy to fall back upon ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
3.2222	`` I do n't know how we could have got along without that , truly . ''
5.7368	`` Mother , I must look about for work .
9.5216	I ought to be earning four or five dollars a week at my age . ''
13.4281	`` You are only fifteen . ''
4.3685	`` But I am stout and strong of my age .
8.2307	I shall soon be a man .
5.8840	Do n't you see my mustache coming , mother ? ''
15.6961	said Herbert , with a laugh .
10.4573	`` Not very distinctly ; but perhaps my eyesight is growing poor , '' answered his mother , smiling .
34.6926	`` The trouble is , '' said Herbert , thoughtfully , `` there is very little chance of work in this town . ''
43.1070	`` I wonder whether Squire Leech would n't hire you through the spring and summer on one of his farms .
3.7807	I heard that he is going to hire a boy . ''
11.8521	`` I am not sure whether he would be willing to hire me , however much he wanted a boy . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
2.9260	`` He do n't seem to like me , nor does Mr. Banks like me . ''
7.1884	`` What can they have against you ?
8.5726	I thought everybody liked you . ''
13.7683	`` That 's because you are my mother , but the squire does n't feel maternal so far as I am concerned .
3.6295	I did n't understand it at first , but now I do . ''
7.4882	`` What is it ? ''
1.7312	`` You remember the squire tried hard to get you to sell this place . ''
31.1090	`` That was last year . ''
7.5071	`` And you would n't sell .
3.5347	That is why he is angry with both of us . ''
4.5228	`` But I do n't understand why he should be , '' said the widow , innocently .
0.1691	`` He said he would take it only as a favor to me . ''
6.4432	`` That was all ` gammon . '
16.8250	Excuse the word , which is n't very elegant , I admit , but it 's the right word for all that .
7.2199	The squire wanted the place very much . ''
7.2299	`` What could he do with it ?
5.8211	He could n't live in it himself . ''
10.3616	`` Not much .
17.4885	I can imagine the look of disgust James 's face would wear at the idea of such a thing .
8.9480	He wanted it for Nahum Brown , who lives in the old house up the road .
70.6895	You know Brown , who is a cousin of Mr. Banks , the superintendent , and he is very anxious to get hold of our house . ''
11.6030	`` How did you learn all this , Herbert ?
8.1146	I never knew it before . ''
23.9191	`` Tom Banks let it out one day . ''
11.4167	`` I do n't see how the squire can dislike us for wanting to stay in our old home . ''
5.2554	`` There are a good many things you do n't understand -- about selfish men -- mother .
10.5491	That is why I am afraid it wo n't be much use to ask the squire for employment . ''
7.1751	`` You may be mistaken about his feelings , Herbert . ''
15.9714	`` At any rate , I 'll go to him , if I ca n't find employment anywhere else in the village . ''
17.7800	`` I wish you would , that is , if you do n't think farm work will be too hard for you . ''
8.2745	`` I 'll risk that . ''
490.7717	In pursuance of this promise , Herbert , after ascertaining that there was no work to be had anywhere else in the village , called one fine morning at the imposing residence of Squire Leech .
7.1602	James was in the yard , at work on a kite .
6.4622	`` Have you come to see me ? ''
27.2138	said James , superciliously .
4.0588	`` No ; I wanted to see your father . ''
8.9027	`` What about ? ''
277.4949	Herbert was about to answer `` on business , '' but it occurred to him that it would be better policy to keep on friendly terms with James , and he said : `` I am looking for work , and I thought he might have some for me . ''
12.0332	`` Perhaps so , '' said James , patronizingly .
0.3613	`` Of course , one in your position must work for a living . ''
6.1674	`` Do n't you expect to work ? ''
15.8756	asked Herbert , in some curiosity .
5.8423	`` Not with my hands , of course , '' said James .
2.7512	`` I may study some genteel profession , such as law . ''
0.4719	`` I am too poor to be genteel , '' said Herbert , amused .
10.3176	`` Of course .
19.0254	You will probably be a day laborer . ''
0.4597	`` I hope to rise to something better in time , '' said Herbert .
104.1380	`` For the present I shall be glad to work by the day , or the month , if your father will engage me . ''
163.7442	`` I think my father is at home ; you can ring and see , '' said James , who could be kind to one who was willing to acknowledge his inferiority .
75.6628	Herbert rang the bell , and was ushered into the presence of Squire Leech , who was examining some papers in the back parlor .
13.3541	`` Good morning , Squire Leech , '' said Herbert , politely .
56.6041	`` Good morning , '' said the squire , jumping to the conclusion that the Carters had made up their minds to sell their place .
6.6061	`` Do you wish to see me ? ''
1.3684	`` Yes , sir ; I hope I do n't interrupt you . ''
2.9432	`` Go on , '' said the squire , waving his hand .
27.3925	`` I am busy , to be sure , but I can give you a few minutes . ''
17.1446	He resolved to take advantage of Mrs. Carter 's necessities , and make a smaller offer for the place .
5.2526	In this way he would make her suffer for her former obstinate refusal to entertain his proposition .
60.2405	His face fell when Herbert said : `` I came to ask you if you could give me employment on one of your farms .
10.2220	My mother has been sick , and I feel that I ought to be doing something to earn money . ''
10.6337	`` Ahem ! ''
3.2427	said the squire , `` I leave all such matters to Mr. Banks .
4.6603	Was that all you wished to say to me ? ''
12.9679	`` I believe so , '' said Herbert .
6.6311	`` Will there be any use in applying to Mr. Banks ? ''
1.5754	`` I do n't know whether he has got help enough or not .
4.6247	Your mother has been sick , has n't she ? ''
10.9679	`` Yes , sir ; all winter . ''
7.7692	`` I heard of it .
5.5248	I suppose you found it expensive , eh ? ''
8.7962	`` Yes , sir .
7.1837	Neither of us could earn anything . ''
5.8148	`` You are in debt , then ? ''
8.7962	`` No , sir .
27.9332	My uncle left us some money last year .
8.4008	That kept us along . ''
4.7627	`` It 's pretty much used up now , I suppose ? ''
9.8591	`` Not quite . ''
30.8137	Herbert was inclined to be surprised at the squire 's apparent interest in their affairs , but the motive soon became apparent .
9.8833	`` Well , you have made up your mind to sell the house now , I suppose ? ''
10.4036	said the squire .
3.7794	`` No , we had n't thought of it . ''
6.2555	`` But you 'll have to . ''
7.5968	`` Not if I can get employment , '' said Herbert .
1.4229	`` Our expenses are very small , and we can live on a little . ''
10.2275	The great man frowned .
3.3937	`` That is all nonsense , '' he said , impatiently .
1.3578	`` It is quite impossible for you to hold on to the house .
32.9373	I am willing to give you cash down three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage for it . ''
25.7540	`` That is n't as much as you offered last year , '' said Herbert , shrewdly .
11.0313	`` I believe I did offer three hundred and fifty then . ''
10.4955	`` Your last offer was fifty dollars more than that . ''
5.7194	`` It may be so , but I told your mother that it was n't a standing offer .
4.4125	She must accept it then or not at all . ''
0.3619	`` We do n't ask you to purchase , '' said Herbert , independently .
0.1839	`` I had no idea of such a thing when I came here . ''
8.0197	`` That makes no difference .
57.7181	You will have to sell , of course , and I have made up my mind to offer you three hundred and fifty .
7.6476	If you had taken me up at the time , I would have given you fifty more .
10.3026	You ca n't expect that now , however . ''
8.3492	`` We do n't expect anything .
7.1800	The house is not for sale . ''
2.9473	`` Then , why are you taking up my valuable time ? ''
9.1018	demanded the squire , frowning with displeasure .
7.6122	`` I beg your pardon , sir .
5.8162	I only came in to ask for employment . ''
2.7963	`` That I might have given you , if you had n't been so unreasonable . ''
10.5431	`` I do n't think we are unreasonable , Squire Leech .
52.0548	Even if we were willing to sell , we should ask , at least , fourteen hundred dollars for the place . ''
25.3750	`` Fourteen hundred !
9.9804	Are you crazy ?
6.5552	I never heard of such a thing . ''
0.4743	`` The place , land and all , cost my father fifteen hundred . ''
6.5291	`` I do n't believe it . ''
1.3798	`` We 've got his papers to show that it is so . ''
10.7394	`` It is n't worth near that now . ''
8.1767	`` It is certainly worth more than eleven hundred , which is all you offer . ''
156.2877	`` Look here , Carter , '' said the squire , `` I do n't mind telling you that I want the place for one of my men -- Brown .
2.6660	That is my only object in making you an offer at all .
87.9200	He is the cousin of Mr. Banks , my superintendent , and I rather think Banks will find you something to do , if you will induce your mother to sell the place . ''
4.5768	`` I ca n't do that , '' said Herbert , slowly .
2.6076	`` I ca n't consent to my mother making such a sacrifice .
50.1678	She might as well give you three or four hundred dollars as sell the place so much under price . ''
3.5406	`` You are a boy , and know nothing about business .
147.0308	You think property must necessarily bring its first cost , though , mind you , I do n't admit that yours cost anything like fifteen hundred dollars . ''
97.9402	`` I am inexperienced , '' Herbert admitted , `` but I am sure it would be foolish to sell for eleven hundred dollars . ''
5.3739	`` You may have to sell for less . ''
9.3632	`` How is that ? ''
6.8553	`` If you are not prepared with the interest when the time comes , I shall foreclose . ''
32.9781	`` You would n't be so hard on us as that , Squire Leech , '' said Herbert , anxiously .
0.1908	`` I do n't call it hard , it is only just and legal .
7.3586	When that time comes , I do n't promise to pay as much as I offer to-day . ''
20.9935	Herbert looked serious .
31.2336	He saw that the squire meant just what he said ; that , in fact , he was lying in wait their need should put them in his power .
16.8115	`` Well , '' said the squire , triumphantly , `` you see how the matter stands now ? ''
13.3416	`` I do , '' said Herbert .
1.5926	`` Then you will cease your foolish opposition to what is best for you . ''
3.1410	`` I will speak to my mother about it , '' said Herbert , rising .
0.1863	`` The place is hers , not mine , and she must decide . ''
4.0717	`` Without your offering any foolish advice , I hope . ''
8.8387	`` I ca n't say as to that , Squire Leech .
11.4867	I will bid you good morning . ''
12.0369	`` Good morning .
4.4029	If you change your mind , call again , and we will see about the employment . ''
15.4859	`` Well , '' said James , as Herbert came out , `` did you get work ? ''
4.5091	`` Not yet ; your father is not sure whether he will find any for me . ''
56.9291	`` When I am a man , '' said James , pompously , `` I do say I may be able to throw something in your way . ''
11.9257	`` Thank you , '' said Herbert , tempted to smile in spite of his serious thoughts .
52.9300	`` I shall be richer than my father , '' added James , `` his property is increasing every year . ''
4.4533	`` You have an excellent prospect before you , '' said Herbert , half enviously .
8.4991	`` That 's so .
4.7565	Would n't you like to change places with me ? ''
6.1968	`` I am not sure about that . ''
6.1968	`` You are not sure about that ? ''
20.5550	repeated James , incredulously .
8.4583	`` No . ''
3.5998	`` Why , I am a rich man 's son . ''
2.2976	`` I know that ; but I have an excellent mother . ''
6.6501	`` She has got no money . ''
23.9139	`` I should not value her more if she were worth a million , '' said Herbert , warmly .
40.5986	`` Of course , '' said James ; `` but that wo n't save you from being a day laborer . ''
76.2511	`` It is my great ambition just at present to become a day laborer , '' said Herbert , smiling .
3.4252	`` Of course , there 's a great difference between us .
3.5656	But I say , Carter , can you help me with this kite ?
8.5858	There 's something wrong about it .
8.6248	It wo n't fly . ''
18.1517	Herbert looked at it critically .
3.2752	`` The trouble is with the frame , '' he said .
7.8414	`` It 's too heavy . ''
4.3465	`` I wish you 'd help me about it . ''
60.5052	Very good-naturedly our hero set to work , and in the course of twenty minutes or so the difficulty was obviated .
10.0006	The kite would fly .
2.9311	`` You may stay and help me fly it , '' said James , condescendingly .
3.5696	`` Thank you ; I shall be needed at home . ''
7.8162	`` Oh , I forgot .
9.3284	Your time is valuable .
8.1981	Here , take this . ''
12.0890	James , with extraordinary liberality , held out five cents to Herbert .
9.5806	`` What is that for ? ''
5.4179	asked Herbert , puzzled , and not offering to take the money .
7.4664	`` For your help about the kite . ''
11.6411	`` Oh , I would n't think of charging anything for that , '' said Herbert , amused .
10.9579	`` Why not ?
5.0571	You are poor , and I am rich . ''
4.0828	`` I know it , but I do n't want money for a trifle like that . ''
221.7779	`` Just as you say , '' said James , returning the money to his pocket , a little relieved , if the truth must be told , that the coin was not accepted , for he was naturally fond of money .
11.0564	`` Good morning , '' said Herbert , turning to go .
5.3754	`` If the kite gets out of order , you can call upon me any time . ''
0.4583	`` I wonder why he did n't take the money , '' thought James .
37.1726	`` He may be poor and proud ; I 've heard of such cases ; but of course it would be absurd for a boy in his position to be proud . ''
10.3588	Herbert kept on his way with a very serious face .
2.6694	It seemed as if they must lose their home , after all .
6.4653	After his interview with Squire Leech , Herbert walked home slowly and thoughtfully .
11.3163	He comprehended now all the danger of the situation .
646.1976	The squire wanted their house , and was mean enough to desire to get it at less than its value , though two or three hundred dollars would have been of little account to him , while to the poor widow whom he wished to defraud it was a great sum .
6.1897	`` How can a rich man be so mean ? ''
20.6565	exclaimed Herbert , indignantly .
7.3560	That question has puzzled more than our hero .
4.0837	Is there something in riches that dwarfs the man , and makes him mean and ignoble ?
5.2728	In too many instances such appears to be the effect .
39.4192	`` Well , mother , '' said Herbert , when he returned to the cottage , `` I 've been to see Squire Leech . ''
7.0850	`` What success did you meet with ? ''
9.6043	asked his mother , anxiously .
6.4346	`` He will probably give me employment . ''
22.6040	`` You see , Herbert , you misjudged him , after all , '' said the widow , her face brightening .
7.2188	`` Wait and see if I did .
7.7636	There is a condition attached . ''
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
5.1662	`` That you will sell him the cottage . ''
8.5213	`` Did he mention that ? ''
0.6488	`` Yes , he offered three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage . ''
10.4216	`` Why , he offered more than that last year . ''
6.2101	`` I reminded him of that . ''
7.6365	`` What did he say ? ''
73.0363	`` He said he would have given three hundred and fifty if we had n't been so unreasonable as to refuse then .
18.4657	Now , as you have been sick , he expects he can get the place on his own terms . ''
3.2555	`` I did n't think Squire Leech would be so ungenerous . ''
23.2881	`` He hinted , besides , that when the next interest is due , he would foreclose , if the money were not ready . ''
17.4167	`` It wo n't be ready , I am afraid , Herbert , '' said his mother , depressed .
8.9345	`` What shall we do ?
13.4342	I am afraid we shall be forced to sell the place , though it would be hard to leave it . ''
39.2769	`` There 's a month before the interest comes due , mother , '' said Herbert , with energy .
7.7973	`` Something may turn up . ''
5.9156	But his mother was not so hopeful as he .
7.7610	`` What can turn up ? ''
9.8387	she said .
7.8658	`` I may get employment . ''
1.5470	`` Even if you do , a boy can earn little in the country . ''
1.4579	`` That is true , mother , but somehow I feel hopeful . ''
10.0435	`` That is because you are young , Herbert .
6.0581	It is natural for youth to be hopeful . ''
1.6677	`` Well , mother , is n't it better to be hopeful than despondent ? ''
6.3836	`` But it wo n't alter wants . ''
347.9136	`` Suppose the worst to happen -- suppose we do leave the house -- we shall have three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollars in cash , to keep us from starving . ''
7.0981	`` And when that is gone ? ''
1.6384	`` Before that is gone , I shall be earning good wages somewhere .
6.4449	You see , mother , matters are not as bad as they might be , after all . ''
6.8330	In spite of her doubts , Mrs. Carter was cheered by her son 's hopeful tone .
5.3348	`` Perhaps you are right , '' she said .
0.2059	`` Since God orders all things , we ought not to be discouraged . ''
14.1837	`` Now you are sensible , mother .
8.7351	How much money have you got left ? ''
23.3437	`` Twenty-five dollars . ''
2.8981	`` Why , that 's enough to pay the interest , and a little over . ''
11.1368	`` But how are we to live for the next month ? ''
5.0756	`` I ought to earn money enough for that . ''
4.5546	`` If there were any chance of finding work . ''
6.0973	`` Well , I will go out again to-morrow . ''
9.6878	Herbert spoke with a confidence which he did not feel .
45.6632	Wrayburn was not a large village , and , in general , boys were to be found in families where a boy 's work was required .
61.0960	In fact , the only one who seemed likely to have work for a boy was Mr. Banks , the squire 's farm superintendent .
78.9900	His son , Tom , might indeed have worked , had he been inclined ; but he was naturally indolent , and his father was too indulgent to compel him to work .
2.8166	He was an only child , and bade fair to be spoiled .
37.2812	Though only fifteen , he had already learned to smoke and drink , and the only limit to either was his scanty pocket money .
101.2923	As Herbert was walking up the street in perplexity , he fell in with Tom , who was smoking a cheap cigar with the air of an old smoker .
13.3195	`` Where are you bound , Herbert ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
11.2474	`` Nowhere in particular .
6.5501	I wish I knew where to go . ''
7.6793	`` Come fishing with me . ''
7.1443	`` I have n't time . ''
3.9676	`` You said you were not going anywhere in particular . ''
4.5503	`` Because I do n't know where to go . ''
6.4013	`` Then , why not go with me ? ''
6.7110	`` I want to find work somewhere . ''
20.0331	Tom shrugged his shoulders .
1.4153	`` That 's just what I am not anxious to find , '' he said .
37.2791	`` My father keeps thinking every day that I ought to be at work , but I do n't see it . ''
0.4690	Tom winked here , and looked , or thought he looked , uncommonly sly .
17.5528	`` Then , your father has work for a boy to do , '' said Herbert , getting interested .
6.6542	`` Oh , yes , it is spring now , and the busy season is beginning .
5.7451	But that sort of work do n't suit me .
8.1301	I will never be a farmer .
9.9894	When I get a little older , I should like to go to the city , and enter a store .
8.7376	That would be jolly . ''
6.3564	`` You might get tired of it . ''
4.5926	`` No , I would n't ; I 'm sick of this stupid old town , though .
7.9606	There 's nothing going on . ''
39.7392	`` I say , Tom , as you do n't want to work , do you think your father would give me a chance ? ''
11.1853	`` I do n't know , '' said Tom .
2.3103	`` I 'll speak to him if you want me to . ''
7.3321	`` I wish you would . ''
12.4418	`` There 'll be one advantage about it .
2.6098	If he hires you , he wo n't be at me to work all the time .
9.0479	I 'll do it .
6.2589	Come along , and I 'll speak to him now . ''
14.1829	`` Thank you , Tom . ''
6.0594	`` Oh , you need n't thank me .
70.4330	It 's for my own sake I 'm doing it as much as yours , '' said Tom , who was at least frank in his selfishness .
8.7594	They went to the small house occupied , much against his will , by Amos Banks .
93.1473	He was in the field , with one of his men , when Tom and Herbert came up , and , jumping over the stone wall , approached him .
7.6996	`` Well , Tom , '' said his father , `` you have come just in time .
4.9310	I want you to ride the horse to plow . ''
0.2160	`` I ca n't , father ; I do n't feel well to-day . ''
7.6974	`` What 's the matter ? ''
4.9372	`` Oh , I 've got a headache . ''
7.4235	`` Riding will do you good . ''
45.9832	`` No , it wo n't , '' said Tom , confidently ; `` but if you want a boy to help you , here he is . ''
25.6207	Mr. Banks turned to Herbert .
12.8830	`` You are Herbert Carter , '' he said .
8.7962	`` Yes , sir .
2.9598	I would like very much to get a chance to work . ''
9.7767	`` You 're the widow Carter 's son ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
4.7247	`` Has your mother decided to sell her cottage ? ''
6.6879	`` I do n't think she has , Mr. Banks . ''
4.0819	`` Of course you know that Squire Leech wants to buy it . ''
8.7962	`` Yes , sir .
1.3823	He told me that he wanted to purchase it for your use . ''
63.4982	`` Just so , '' said the superintendent , stopping work : `` I 've taken a fancy to that house , and so has Mrs. Banks You had better accept the squire 's offer . ''
21.0551	`` That would be too much of a sacrifice , Mr. Banks The squire wants to get the place considerably below its value . ''
7.6541	`` Very likely you overvalue it . ''
7.5628	`` Mother is attached to it .
6.0827	She would rather have it than a nicer house .
5.5042	Father built it , and it was here they lived for nearly fifteen years . ''
16.5474	`` No doubt -- no doubt , '' said Banks , impatiently ; `` but poor folks ca n't afford to be sentimental .
15.4463	If it 's for your mother 's interest to sell , then she 'd ought to sell , that 's my opinion . ''
17.8793	`` We may have to sell some time , but as long as we can hold on to the place , we mean to . ''
43.6370	`` I may as well say , '' said the superintendent , `` that the squire has authorized me to hire you to work , in case your mother consents to sell . ''
9.8623	`` Is that the condition ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
25.2857	`` Then , '' said Herbert , turning away , `` I am afraid I must give up the chance . ''
21.1523	`` That 's an obstinate boy , '' said Banks , looking after him ; `` but he 'll come around after a while .
6.2811	The squire says he 'll have to , or be turned out for not paying the interest . ''
10.6636	To be willing to work , and yet to be unable to find an opportunity , was certainly a hardship .
146.6257	Herbert was a boy of active temperament , and , even had he not needed the wages of labor , he would still have felt it necessary to his happiness to do something .
88.4994	In the course of his walks about the village , he stopped at the house of a carpenter , who bore the rather peculiar name of Jeremiah Crane .
211.6214	Mr. Crane owned about an acre and a half of land , which might have been cultivated , but at the time Herbert called , early in April , there were no indications of this intention .
15.2072	The carpenter was at work in a small shop just beyond the house , and there Herbert found him .
37.8885	`` Well , Herbert , '' said Mr. Crane , in a friendly manner , `` what are you up to nowadays ? ''
8.8895	`` Nothing profitable , Mr. Crane ; I am wandering about in search of work . ''
6.3961	`` Ca n't you find any ? ''
9.2005	`` Not yet . ''
7.3416	`` Have you been to Squire Leech ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
1.4348	`` I should think he might find something for you to do . ''
4.3104	`` There is a little difficulty in the way . ''
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
71.4191	Then Herbert told Mr. Crane about the squire 's wish to purchase their cottage , and his vexation because they were not willing to sell .
5.0468	`` Seems to me that 's unreasonable in the squire .
2.5631	He acts as if it was your duty to oblige him . ''
25.2592	`` I do n't know but we shall have to come to his terms , '' said Herbert , rather dejectedly .
1.5730	`` We certainly shall if I do n't find anything to do . ''
236.2664	`` I wish I could help you ; but , if you were to learn my trade , you would n't be worth any wages for nigh a year , and you could n't afford to work so long without pay . ''
6.1747	`` No , I could n't . ''
15.6990	`` Besides , in a village like this , there is n't more than enough work for one man .
7.2035	Why , there is n't more than one new house built a year .
33.0315	If the squire wants to provide Mr. Banks with a house , why does n't he build him one ?
8.2173	He might just as well as not . ''
5.0374	`` It would cost him more than to buy our place at the price he offers . ''
9.2040	`` So it would .
4.9581	Your place must have cost fifteen hundred dollars , land and all . ''
2.6711	`` So I did , but the squire laughed at the idea .
18.5855	All he offers is eleven hundred . ''
6.7173	`` Do n't you sell at that price .
5.8065	It would be too much of a sacrifice . ''
4.6955	`` We wo n't unless we are obliged to . ''
5.6866	`` I hope you wo n't be obliged to .
14.9041	A man as rich as Squire Leech ought not to try to get it under price . ''
8.5744	`` I suppose he wants to make a good bargain , no matter if it is at our expense .
14.3191	I wish you had a farm , Mr. Crane , so you could give me work on it . ''
0.3958	`` I 've got more farm now than I can take care of . ''
5.9343	`` Do n't you have a garden ? ''
0.1571	`` I 've got the land , but no time to work on it .
147.0078	My wife often wishes we had our own vegetables , instead of having to buy , but you see , after working in the shop , or outside , all day , I 'm too tired to work on land . ''
8.5203	`` How much land have you ? ''
2.9896	`` About an acre that I could cultivate , I suppose . ''
6.2979	`` Engage me to take care of it .
2.6913	I 'll do all the work , and your wife can have her own vegetables . ''
1.5532	`` Really , I never thought of that , '' said the carpenter .
2.4356	`` I do n't know but it might be a good idea .
9.7791	How much pay would you want ? ''
58.0609	`` I 'll tell you , '' said Herbert , who had a business turn , and who had already matured the plan in his own mind .
76.8768	`` If you will pay for plowing , and provide seed , I will do the planting , and gather it when harvest time comes , for one-third of the crop . ''
2.4478	`` You mean , you will take your pay in vegetables ? ''
11.7106	`` Yes , '' said Herbert , promptly .
0.1988	`` If there is more than you need , I can sell the surplus .
8.5735	What do you say ? ''
9.0011	`` It strikes me as a fair offer , Herbert .
20.7562	Just wait a minute , and I 'll go and ask my wife what she thinks of it . ''
8.1886	Mr. Crane went into the house , leaving Herbert in the shop .
24.4863	He reappeared in five minutes .
13.4309	Herbert , to whom the plan seemed every minute more desirable , awaited his report eagerly .
2.1663	`` My wife is all for your plan , '' he said .
10.6892	`` She says it is the only way she knows of likely to give her the fresh vegetables she wants .
7.3764	Besides , she thinks well of you .
1.4636	So , it 's a settled thing , if you say so . ''
7.5085	`` I do say so , '' Herbert replied , promptly .
10.2261	`` Now , when will you have it plowed ? ''
5.5747	`` I shall leave all that to you .
7.5476	I have n't time to make arrangements .
6.4321	You can engage anybody you like to do the plowing , and I will pay the bill . ''
6.6174	`` Then , as to the seed ? ''
3.9066	`` There , again , I trust all to you .
5.3788	You can buy what you find to be necessary , and the bill may be sent to me .
10.0818	You may ask Mrs. Crane what vegetables she wants . ''
14.7958	`` All right , '' said Herbert .
34.5794	`` Please understand , '' said the carpenter , `` that I will do what I have said , but I do n't want to be worried about the details .
10.4221	You are a boy , but I shall trust to your judgment , as you are interested in the result . ''
7.1322	`` Thank you , '' said Herbert , rather proud of the confidence reposed in him .
3.5785	`` I will do what I can to justify your confidence .
4.3366	I 'll go right off and see about the plowing . ''
9.1812	`` Very well . ''
16.3529	Whatever Herbert did was done promptly .
194.1936	He knew of a man named Kimball , a farmer on a small scale , who was accustomed to do work for neighbors , not having enough work of his own to occupy his whole time .
13.8358	He went to see him at once .
36.4486	`` Mr. Kimball , '' he said , `` I want to know if I can engage you to do some plowing for me . ''
8.3726	`` For you ! ''
8.0672	repeated the farmer , opening his eyes .
1.3511	`` Why , you have n't taken a farm , have you ? ''
29.9379	`` Not yet , '' said Herbert , smiling ; `` but I 've agreed to cultivate a little land on shares . ''
11.4382	`` Sho !
8.8914	you do n't say so !
8.4821	What land is it ? ''
7.0286	`` It 's the field behind Mr. Crane 's house . ''
4.9338	`` So he 's engaged you , has he ?
2.9817	Well , I 've often wondered why he did n't cultivate it .
9.7071	Might as well as not . ''
7.7118	`` It 's my idea .
7.6119	I proposed it to him .
15.3624	Now , when can you come ? ''
38.7840	`` Wait a minute , '' said the farmer , cautiously ; `` who 's a-going to pay me ? ''
19.7000	`` Mr. Crane .
0.1887	He told me to engage somebody , and he would pay the bill . ''
59.8155	`` That 's all right , then , '' said the farmer , in a tone of satisfaction ; `` Crane 's a man that always pays his bills . ''
3.2546	`` I hope I shall have the same reputation , '' said Herbert .
14.5644	`` I hope you will , but you 're only a boy , you know , and I could n't collect of a minor .
7.6030	That 's the law . ''
5.5390	`` I should n't think anybody 'd be dishonest enough to bring that as an excuse . ''
19.3015	`` Plenty would do it , so I have to be careful What time do you want me to do the work for you ? ''
7.1716	`` As soon as you can . ''
4.0077	`` Let me see , I guess I can come to-morrow .
3.1768	There ai n't anything very pressing for me to do then . ''
7.6300	`` That 's good , '' said Herbert , with satisfaction .
10.3949	`` You 'll find me there , and I can ride the horse to plow if you want me to . ''
5.8571	`` I should like to have you . ''
52.0086	`` Well , '' thought Herbert , as he started for home to tell his mother what he had done , `` I 've made a beginning . ''
59.9518	`` I suppose you have n't found any work yet , Herbert , '' said his mother , in a tone of resignation , as he entered the little cottage .
5.6359	`` Yes , I have ; though I shall have to wait some time for the pay . ''
12.4456	`` What is it , Herbert ? ''
125.2163	`` I 'm going to cultivate a garden on shares , mother ; so next fall and winter you can have all the vegetables you want . ''
20.4762	`` How is that , Herbert ?
7.2544	Tell me all about it . ''
31.3866	When Herbert had detailed the contract he had entered into , he was glad to find that his mother approved of it .
91.9252	She declared that it would be very satisfactory to her to have an abundant stock of vegetables , but she said , doubtfully : `` Do you think you know enough of farming to attend to all the work ? ''
9.2081	`` If I do n't I can easily ask some farmer , '' said Herbert , confidently .
1.5308	`` I am not in the least afraid to undertake the job . ''
6.8155	He went to bed that night feeling that at last he had obtained something to do .
77.8033	The reader will perhaps recall the statement in our first chapter that there was a little land connected with the cottage , which was used for the growth of vegetables .
355.4030	This , in fact , supplied nearly all that was required by the widow and her son , and the probability was that Herbert would be able to send to market nearly all his share of vegetables obtained under his new contract , and thus obtain payment in money , of which they were so much in need .
17.1369	Herbert went to work in earnest .
10.1101	It took only part of one day to plow the field which he was to cultivate .
46.5619	He decided , after consultation with Mrs. Crane , to appropriate two-thirds of the land to potatoes , and the remainder to different kinds of vegetables .
1.7350	He was guided partly by the consideration of which would be most marketable .
0.7599	On the third day , while at work , he heard his name called .
168.0101	It must be explained that Mr. Crane 's house and land were on the corner of two streets , so that he was in full sight , while in the field , from the side street .
4.7843	Looking up , he recognized James Leech , who was surveying him with evident curiosity .
5.4969	`` Good morning , James , '' said Herbert , going on with his work .
5.3356	`` I see you 've got a job , '' said James .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
13.9308	`` Has Mr. Crane hired you ? ''
9.3205	`` Not exactly . ''
2.9731	`` Then , why are you at work in his field ? ''
3.5982	`` Because I 've agreed to work it on shares . ''
9.3632	`` How is that ? ''
7.8465	`` I am to have a third of the crops to pay me for my services . ''
6.1107	`` What can you do with it ? ''
6.2543	`` Part of the vegetables we can use at home , and the balance I shall sell . ''
4.0885	`` I should n't think you 'd like that arrangement . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
2.7460	`` Because you have so long to wait for your pay . ''
28.4984	`` That is true , but it 's better than not working at all , and I 've tried all over the village in vain to get employment . ''
2.6118	`` Do you think you 'll make much out of it ? ''
4.4131	`` I do n't think I shall make my fortune , but I shall make something . ''
6.2237	`` Do n't it tire you to work ? ''
16.0608	asked James , with some curiosity .
8.0275	`` Of course , if I work all day ; but I do n't mind that . ''
8.3574	`` I should . ''
5.6988	`` You are not used to work . ''
5.6396	`` I should say not , '' returned James , with pride .
6.0272	`` I never worked in my life . ''
17.6055	It was a strange thing to be proud of , but there are some who have nothing better to be proud of .
11.2049	`` I like to work , '' said Herbert .
8.0781	`` You do ? ''
2.6802	`` Yes , only I like to get something for my labor .
3.7645	You expect to work some time , do n't you ? ''
11.9838	`` Not with my hands , '' said James .
5.1918	`` I shall never be reduced to that . ''
2.3877	`` Do you think it so very bad to work with your hands ?
9.7919	Is n't it respectable ? ''
22.7154	`` Oh , I suppose it 's respectable , '' said James ; `` but only the lower classes do it . ''
11.0535	`` Am I one of the lower classes ? ''
20.0620	asked Herbert , amused .
7.1072	`` Of course you are . ''
5.3931	`` But suppose I should get rich some day , '' said Herbert .
8.1392	`` That is n't very likely .
7.5138	You ca n't get rich raising vegetables . ''
5.7080	`` No , I do n't expect to .
6.2082	Still , I may in some other way .
2.9641	Did n't you ever know any poor boys that got rich ? ''
7.1275	`` I suppose there have been some , '' admitted James .
5.9594	`` Have n't you ever heard of Vanderbilt ? ''
8.0957	`` Of course I have .
19.6919	Father says he 's worth forty millions . ''
5.2210	`` Do n't you consider him a gentleman ? ''
7.3456	`` Of course I do . ''
79.8475	`` Well , he was a poor boy once , and used to ferry passengers across from Staten Island to New York . ''
8.8740	`` Did he ?
7.2695	I did n't know that . ''
75.8567	`` Suppose my uncle had left me all his fortune -- a hundred thousand dollars -- would I have been a gentleman , then ? ''
5.2571	`` Yes , but it is n't the same as , if you had always been rich . ''
8.6233	`` I do n't agree with your ideas , James .
186.2437	It seems to me something besides money is needed to make a gentleman ; still , I hope to get on in the world , and I should n't object to being rich , though I do n't see any prospect of it just at present . ''
14.0961	`` No , '' said James .
6.7734	`` You will probably always be poor . ''
8.1769	`` That 's very encouraging , '' said Herbert , laughing .
9.2770	`` How about yourself ? ''
2.5070	`` Oh , I shall be a rich man like father . ''
7.2580	`` That 's very encouraging for you .
4.8033	I hope when you are a man you 'll give me work if I need it . ''
6.2863	`` I will bear it in mind , '' said James , with an important air .
12.9236	`` Now I must be going . ''
37.6464	That day , at dinner , James said to his father : `` That Carter boy has got a job . ''
8.2832	`` Has he ? ''
8.5519	asked the squire , not very well pleased .
6.0827	`` Yes , he 's working at Mr. Crane 's . ''
7.2849	`` What is he doing ? ''
8.4422	`` Working in the garden . ''
7.7728	`` What wages does Crane pay him ? ''
9.3250	`` None at all .
0.3776	He says he has agreed to work for the third of the crops . ''
8.3094	`` Did he say that ? ''
8.9516	asked the squire , with satisfaction .
17.2932	`` Yes , he told me so this morning . ''
5.6484	`` You are sure he gets no money ? ''
5.5547	`` Yes ; he is paid wholly in vegetables .
12.3883	He said he could n't find employment anywhere else in the village , so he had to work that way . ''
1.9742	`` That boy stands very much in his own light , '' said the squire .
9.4482	`` How is that , father ? ''
20.7654	`` I told him Mr. Banks would give him work if he would agree to sell me his cottage . ''
4.4948	`` He does n't own it , does he ? ''
5.1581	`` His mother , of course , I mean .
3.4841	It 's the boy that keeps her from selling it . ''
7.5474	`` Why does he do that ? ''
39.4490	`` Oh , they 've got a silly notion that no other place would seem like home to them , and , besides , they think I do n't offer them enough . ''
7.3983	`` How much do you offer them ? ''
64.2113	`` Eleven hundred dollars ; that is , I have a mortgage on the place for seven hundred and fifty .
24.1912	I offer them three hundred and fifty dollars besides . ''
4.3824	`` Is that all the money they are worth ? ''
10.0259	`` Yes ; they are very foolish to refuse , for they 'll have to come to it some time .
63.2047	In about a week the interest comes due , and I 'm very sure they wo n't be able to meet it . ''
7.7983	`` Suppose they do n't ? ''
23.4632	`` Then , '' said the squire , with a satisfied smile , `` I shall take possession , and they 'll have to sell . ''
8.6011	`` Herbert says he hopes to be rich some time . ''
3.3196	`` I dare say , '' said the squire , laughing heartily .
4.7813	`` Everybody does , so far as I know . ''
3.1426	`` Do you think there is any chance of it ? ''
19.5616	`` About one in a thousand . ''
9.8617	`` I should n't want the lower classes to get rich , '' said James , thoughtfully .
5.1966	`` They 'd think they were our equals . ''
7.1476	`` Yes , no doubt . ''
24.6198	James was not aware that his grandfather had once been a poor mechanic , or rather he ignored it .
1.9355	He chose to consider that he had sprung from a long line of wealthy ancestors .
27.3347	His father heard with pleasure that Herbert was not likely to realize any money at present for his services .
3.0660	Already he felt that the little cottage was as good as his .
136.5628	It was only a week now to the time of paying interest , and he was very sure that Mrs. Carter would be unprepared to meet it .
0.1867	`` In that case , '' he decided , `` I will certainly foreclose .
4.0671	There will be no sense in granting them any further indulgence .
13.2138	It will be for their interest to sell the cottage , and get rid of the burden which the interest imposes .
9.7456	Really , they ought to consider it a favor that I am willing to take it off their hands . ''
40.1124	We are very apt to think it is for the interest of others to do what we greatly desire , and I do n't suppose the squire was singular in this .
7.4627	I think , however , that there are many who are less selfish and more considerate of others .
20.2011	Herbert , too , was thinking , and thinking seriously , of the interest that was so soon coming due .
317.3210	In spite of his own and his mother 's economy , when the preceding day arrived , all they could raise toward the payment was thirteen dollars , and the sum required was twenty-two dollars and a half .
166.1285	`` Mother , '' said Herbert , at dinner the day before , `` I see only one chance for us , and that is , to borrow the money .
101.2561	If anyone would lend us ten dollars we could pay the interest , and then we should be free from anxiety for six months . ''
0.2924	`` I am afraid you will find that difficult , '' said his mother .
12.3232	`` The squire is the only rich man in the village , and of course we ca n't apply to him . ''
5.0877	`` At any rate , I can but try .
20.2393	Instead of going to work this afternoon , I shall go about and try to borrow the money .
1.5172	If I ca n't , then I suppose we must give up the house . ''
9.7038	Certainly the prospect seemed far from cheerful .
13.9345	It was with very little confidence in his ultimate success that Herbert set out on his borrowing expedition .
85.8052	The number of those who could be called capitalists in a small village like Wrayburn was very small , and it happened very remarkably that all of them were short of funds .
216.9797	One man had just bought a yoke of oxen , and so spent all his available cash ; another had been shingling his barn ; and still another confessed to having money , but it was in the savings bank , and he did n't like to disturb it .
3.2029	So , at supper time , Herbert came in , depressed and dispirited .
8.0824	`` Well , mother , it 's no use , '' he said , as her anxious look met his .
11.2812	`` I did n't much think you could borrow the money , '' she answered , trying to look cheerful .
0.6177	`` There 's only one thing remains to be done , '' said Herbert .
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
1.5195	`` To try to induce the squire to give us more time . ''
4.2822	`` I do n't think he will do that . ''
8.4583	`` Nor I .
12.0643	In that case we must come to his terms ; but it 's a pity to sacrifice the property , mother . ''
11.9009	`` Yes , Herbert ; I shall be sorry to leave the old place , '' she sighed .
2.9014	`` You were born here , and your father was always very much attached to it .
3.1292	But poor folks ca n't have everything they wish , and it might be worse . ''
32.9669	`` Yes , it might be worse , and if the squire was not so bent in getting the place into his hands , it might be better . ''
5.1073	`` I suppose we ought not to blame him for looking out for his own interest . ''
8.6097	`` Yes , we ought ; when it seems that he is ready to injure his poorer neighbors . ''
19.2173	Mrs. Carter did not reply .
20.6887	She did not wish further to incense her son against the squire , yet in her heart she could not help agreeing with him .
19.0356	The next day Herbert did not go to work as usual .
1.5811	He did not feel like it , while matters were in such uncertainty .
717.2186	He knew the squire would be at the cottage a little before twelve o'clock , and he wanted to be with his mother at that time , for he felt that , if the place must be sold , he would be more likely to get good terms for it than his mother , who was of an easy and yielding disposition .
30.9549	He took a little walk in the course of the forenoon , not with any particular object in view , but in order to pass the time .
14.4574	As he was passing the hotel -- for there was a small hotel in the village -- he heard his name called .
0.1925	Turning round , he found that it was the landlord who had called him .
12.4255	`` Come here a minute , Herbert , '' he said .
19.9070	Herbert obeyed the summons .
7.5010	`` What are you doing nowadays ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
5.0946	`` I have turned farmer , '' said our hero .
7.0313	`` Whom are you working for ? ''
8.3726	`` For myself . ''
10.3865	`` How is that ?
8.4919	I do n't understand . ''
7.3765	`` I am cultivating Mr. Crane 's land on shares . ''
5.0735	`` Does it take up all jour time ? ''
21.8391	`` No ; I would only work part of the day if I had anything else to do . ''
3.4091	`` I 'll tell you what I have been thinking of .
3.0825	There 's a young man boarding with me from the city , a Mr. Cameron .
15.5218	He was a college student , but his eyes gave out , and the doctor sent him out of the city to get well .
17.5580	He wants some one to read to him part of the time , and go about with him for company .
20.7458	He is from a rich family -- the son of a wealthy manufacturer -- and he will be willing to pay a fair price . ''
5.2335	`` Do you think I would suit him ? ''
19.6732	asked Herbert , eagerly .
6.2848	`` Yes , I think you would .
11.2415	You are a good scholar , and when I mentioned you to him , he said he would like to see you .
12.1454	He said he would prefer a boy , as he would be more ready to adapt himself to his wishes . ''
14.7669	`` When can I see Mr. Cameron ? ''
10.3327	asked our hero .
17.5701	`` Come in now .
6.9012	You will find him in his room .
14.0696	Here , John , show Herbert up to number six . ''
8.5843	Herbert was ushered into one of the best rooms the hotel afforded .
12.5563	A young man , of pleasant appearance , was sitting at the window , with a green shade over his eyes .
8.7749	He pushed up this , that he might see Herbert .
0.8277	`` This is Herbert Carter , Mr. Cameron , '' said John , unceremoniously .
29.1375	`` I am glad to see you , Herbert , '' said the young man , smiling as he extended his hand .
8.5451	He was secretly pleased with Herbert 's open and manly face .
2.8964	`` Did the landlord say why I might need your assistance ? ''
6.2718	`` He said your eyes were affected . ''
14.5703	`` Yes , they broke down a month since .
6.9196	I am a student of Yale College , in the junior class .
7.8919	I suppose I tasked my eyes too severely .
4.7554	At any rate , they gave out , and I am forbidden to use them at all . ''
6.0295	`` That must be a great loss to you , '' said Herbert , with sympathy .
8.5478	`` It is .
16.6168	I am very fond of reading and study , and the time passes very heavily in the absence of my usual employment . ''
4.4380	`` I do n't know what I should do if I could not use my eyes . ''
6.3841	`` You would find it a great hardship .
12.2960	Now I must tell you why I came here .
3.0894	The doctor told me I should be better off in the country than in the city .
38.1156	He said that the sight of the green grass would be good for me , and the fresh air , in improving my general health , would help my eyes also .
32.8435	I had n't much choice as to a place , but some one mentioned Wrayburn , and so I came here .
47.8373	But I soon found that , unless I got some pleasant company and some one who could read to me , I should die of weariness .
1.4297	That brings me to my object in asking you to call upon me .
9.5109	How is your time occupied ? ''
6.2690	`` I have taken an acre of land to cultivate on shares , '' answered Herbert .
4.8505	`` It was because I could find nothing else to do , and must do something . ''
6.9784	`` Does that keep you pretty busy ? ''
33.2168	`` It is planting time now , but I could get along with working there half a day . ''
1.4039	`` And could you place yourself at my disposal the other half ? ''
5.2384	`` I should be glad to do it , '' answered Herbert .
29.7856	`` Suppose , then , that you work in the field in the forenoon , and give me every afternoon . ''
10.9395	`` All right , '' said Herbert , promptly .
16.9257	`` Now comes another question .
0.3430	What pay would you expect for giving me so much of your time ? ''
7.1254	`` I should n't know what to charge , Mr. Cameron .
6.9650	I leave that matter entirely with you . ''
22.4207	`` Would you be satisfied with five dollars a week ? ''
40.2595	Five dollars a week !
17.8587	Herbert could hardly believe his ears .
23.5100	Why , he would have been well paid if this had been given him for the whole of his time , but for half it seemed munificent .
0.2157	`` I am afraid I ca n't earn that much , '' he answered .
5.6601	`` I would be willing to take less . ''
13.4134	`` You do n't know how hard I shall make you work , '' said the young man , smiling .
16.8791	`` I insist upon paying you five dollars a week . ''
228.5306	`` I do n't seriously object , '' said Herbert , smiling ; `` but if you think , after the first week , that it is too much , you can pay me less . ''
3.5275	`` I see that we are not likely to quarrel on the subject of salary then .
9.2965	When can you begin ? ''
18.6756	`` This afternoon , if you wish . ''
5.4920	`` I do wish it , otherwise the afternoon would pass very slowly to me . ''
9.8846	`` Then , I will be here at one o'clock . ''
24.7553	`` Half past one will do . ''
7.5444	`` I will be on hand .
6.8559	Till then I will bid you good morning , as I shall be wanted at home . ''
15.6866	`` Very well , Herbert . ''
4.4651	Herbert left the room and hurried home , for it was nearly twelve .
6.1173	On the way he stopped at the post office , and found a letter addressed to his mother .
11.7166	He did not recognize the handwriting , nor , such was his hurry , did he notice where it was postmarked .
0.5964	He had no watch , but thought it must be close upon twelve o'clock .
7.0013	So he thrust the letter into his pocket , and continued his way homeward on a half run .
38.0348	He was in time , for , just as he reached the front gate from one direction , the squire reached it from the other .
4.2747	`` Good morning , '' said the squire , a little stiffly .
7.8038	`` Is your mother at home ? ''
8.0608	`` I presume she is .
7.6384	Wo n't you come in ? ''
52.3729	`` I wonder if they 've got the money ready , '' thought the squire , as he followed Herbert into the modest sitting room .
3.3553	Leaving the squire in the sitting room , Herbert went in quest of his mother .
10.6726	`` Squire Leech is here , '' he said .
6.0906	`` What shall we say to him ? ''
9.6643	asked his mother , soberly .
18.4805	`` Wait a minute and I will tell you , '' said Herbert , his face brightening .
4.6002	`` I 've had a stroke of luck , mother .
0.9439	I 've been engaged to work afternoons , at five dollars a week . ''
4.5703	`` Who has engaged to pay you such high wages ? ''
19.9834	asked Mrs. Carter , astonished .
1.6005	`` A young man staying at the hotel , whose eyes are weak .
1.2657	I am to read to him , and do whatever else he requires .
6.6925	I got the chance through the landlord . ''
3.0503	`` You are certainly fortunate , '' said his mother , gratified .
234.2878	`` Now , what I am going to propose to the squire is to wait two or three weeks for the balance of the interest till I can make it up out of my wages . ''
43.6045	`` If he were n't so anxious to get possession of the place he would ; but I am afraid on that account he will refuse But we ought to go in . ''
42.2029	Mrs. Carter removed the apron which she had worn about her work , and entered the sitting room , followed by Herbert .
12.7253	`` I hope you will excuse my keeping you waiting , Squire Leech , '' she said .
1.5530	`` Certainly , ma'am , though I am rather in a hurry . ''
4.5991	`` I suppose you have come about the interest ? ''
0.1822	`` It is due to-day , as , of course , you know . ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
3.5191	`` I suppose you have it ready , '' said the squire , eyeing her shrewdly .
7.6460	`` I can pay you fifteen dollars of it , '' said the widow , nervously .
18.0334	Squire Leech felt exultant , but he only frowned .
3.8499	`` It amounts to twenty-two dollars and a half , '' he said , sharply .
106.1071	`` I know that , and I shall be able to pay the remainder if you will be kind enough to wait two or three weeks . ''
0.8589	Not knowing anything of Herbert 's good fortune , Squire Leech utterly disbelieved this .
2.8651	He knew no source from which the widow could get the money .
16.8477	`` It is easy enough to make promises , '' he said , with a sneer , `` but that does n't satisfy me .
8.3752	I want my money . ''
4.9618	Now Herbert felt it time for him to take part in the conversation .
3.4346	`` My mother can keep her promise , '' he said .
8.8316	`` Can she ?
2.8849	Perhaps you will explain where you expect to get the money . ''
9.6137	`` From my wages , '' answered Herbert , proudly .
0.2230	`` I was n't aware that you received any , '' sneered the squire .
155.7533	`` I have just made an engagement to work for five dollars a week , '' said our hero , enjoying the squire 's look of surprise .
11.0629	`` Indeed !
8.9635	Who pays you that ? ''
10.2256	`` A gentleman boarding at the hotel has engaged me to read to him as his eyes are weak . ''
0.6432	`` A fool and his money are soon parted , '' said Squire Leech .
18.6257	`` You may retain the position a week . ''
7.5954	`` I hope to keep it .
8.1537	I feel sure that I shall . ''
3.6404	`` I do n't , '' said the squire , emphatically .
25.4476	`` Then are you willing to wait -- say two weeks -- for the rest of the interest ? ''
3.8158	`` No , I am not , and you ought to have known I should n't be .
4.9305	There is a way of arranging the whole matter . ''
5.3585	`` By selling the place , you mean ? ''
6.5341	`` Yes ; I mean just that .
37.1322	It is folly for you to think of keeping the property with such a heavy mortgage upon it on which you are unable to pay the interest .
4.4517	I have offered you a fair price for it . ''
14.8401	`` You offered four hundred dollars less than it cost . ''
8.9490	`` That is nonsense !
27.0511	It never cost fifteen hundred dollars . ''
0.1920	`` I have my husband 's word for it , '' said the widow .
1.3615	`` Then , he made some mistake , you may be sure . ''
10.0040	`` I am sure father was right , '' said Herbert .
3.4751	`` Besides , we have his bills to prove it . ''
0.5642	`` That 's neither here nor there , '' said Squire Leech , impatiently .
379.4542	`` Even if it cost ten thousand dollars , it 's only worth eleven hundred now ; that is to say , three hundred and fifty dollars over and above the mortgage . ''
11.4711	`` You are hard upon me , Squire Leech , '' said Mrs. Carter , despondently .
1.4715	`` You are a woman , ma'am , and women never understand business .
6.2468	I make allowance for you ; but your son ought to know better than to encourage you . ''
2.8776	`` I want my mother to be treated fairly and justly . ''
3.0555	`` Do you mean to imply that I would treat her otherwise , young man ? ''
10.0359	demanded the squire , angrily .
2.3582	`` I advise you not to make an enemy of me . ''
21.6114	Herbert looked sober .
18.4131	The squire might not be right but certainly he had the power to carry his point and that power he was certain to exercise .
6.5558	`` Will you give my mother and myself a little time to consult what is to be done ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
1.6492	`` Yes , '' said the squire , feeling that he had carried his point .
78.0981	`` I might refuse , of course , but I wish to be easy with you and therefore I will give you till half past twelve .
6.0134	I will be back at that time . ''
6.3947	He took his cane and left the house .
16.3947	His reference to the post office reminded Herbert of the letter he had in his pocket for his mother .
1.2837	`` Here 's a letter for you , mother , '' he said .
9.4168	`` A letter !
7.8806	Who can it be from ? ''
14.4500	`` It 's postmarked at Randolph , '' said Herbert .
5.8931	`` Perhaps it 's from Aunt Nancy , '' suggested the widow .
11.9238	`` I do n't know anyone else in Randolph that would be likely to write to me . ''
22.3220	She opened the envelope and uttered a cry of surprise as two bills dropped out and fluttered to the floor .
10.1281	Herbert picked them up eagerly and cried : `` Why , mother , they are ten-dollar bills .
22.9551	Twenty dollars in all ! ''
23.3437	`` Twenty dollars ! ''
18.0428	repeated Mrs. Carter , in amazement .
11.4566	`` Hurrah !
13.7540	now we can pay the interest ! ''
21.2871	exclaimed Herbert .
7.0445	`` Wo n't the squire be mad ! ''
10.2180	and he laughed joyously .
6.8740	`` Read the letter aloud , mother . ''
80.3799	Mrs. Carter read as follows : `` MY DEAR NIECE : I have thought of you often , and wish we were not so far distant from each other .
2.7183	I should enjoy seeing you and that good son of yours often .
5.1353	I am afraid you have had a hard time getting along .
1.4947	My wants are few and I have more than enough to supply them .
21.5223	I inclose twenty dollars in this letter .
5.2551	I shall not need them , for an old woman like me can live on very little .
2.6564	`` I wish you would write to me sometimes or ask Herbert to .
2.5491	I feel lonely and it would be a great favor to me .
80.3912	If it were not so far , I would ask you and Herbert to come over and spend a day or two with me .
6.7539	Perhaps you can manage to do it some time .
39.3693	Only do n't delay too long , for I am getting old and ca n't expect to live much longer , `` Your affectionate aunt , `` NANCY CARTER . ''
20.9389	`` How good of Aunt Nancy !
3.4185	If her brother had possessed her kind heart , we should be better off to-day . ''
3.7262	`` It came just in the nick of time , mother .
10.8472	How lucky ! ''
5.3351	`` Say , rather , how providential , my son .
7.5583	We owe to the kindness of God .
7.1438	He will not see us want . ''
9.4463	`` Of course you are right , mother ; but the squire wo n't regard it in the same light .
4.6373	He will be terribly disappointed , for he thinks he has got us in his power . ''
9.2817	`` I am thankful that this is to be our home for six months more . ''
8.1130	`` Longer than that , mother .
12.0354	I am earning something now , and I will save up money to pay our next interest . ''
16.1660	`` Squire Leech is coming back , '' said Mrs. Carter .
8.2316	`` See how briskly he walks ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
3.2799	`` I do n't think he 'll be so cheerful when he leaves the house . ''
5.1449	`` I do n't think we ought to exult , Herbert . ''
3.8023	`` I ca n't help it , mother and I 'm not ashamed of it , either .
8.1224	You are carrying benevolence too far . ''
0.4072	Here the squire 's knock was heard , and Herbert went to admit him .
8.4348	The squire was in very good spirits .
23.8854	All the way back from the post office he had been congratulating himself on the elegant bargain he was about to make .
4.8206	The widow and her son had been obliged to yield .
225.1102	Squire Leech thought more of Herbert than of his mother , for he was convinced that but for him he could have talked over Mrs. Carter six months before .
3.6116	`` Serves the boy right , '' he said to himself .
4.7728	`` It was preposterous in him to oppose my wishes .
3.7458	He might have known I would advise what was best . ''
6.7479	The squire meant what was best for him .
3.3236	He had not given much thought what would be best for Mrs. Carter .
37.4049	`` Some men would take advantage of their situation and reduce their offer , '' thought the squire , virtuously , `` but I wo n't be hard on them .
21.8623	They shall have the three hundred and fifty dollars . ''
50.4829	`` Well , '' said he cheerfully , as Herbert opened the door , `` I believe I have given you the time I agreed upon . ''
11.5157	`` Yes , sir , '' said Herbert .
8.8285	`` Please walk in . ''
36.0783	The squire expected to find him sober and depressed , but in spite of himself Herbert could not help looking in good spirits .
69.9819	This puzzled the squire a little , but he said to himself : `` Probably they have decided that my offer was n't so bad a one , after all . ''
134.9004	`` Well , '' said the village magnate , `` well , Mrs. Carter , now that you have had time to think over my proposal , you have probably seen its advantages . ''
1.4763	`` I should not be willing to give up the house , sir .
1.4399	My husband built it , and -- '' The squire 's brow darkened .
7.7663	What a perverse , obstinate woman she was !
4.4527	`` That ai n't the question , '' he exclaimed , pounding his cane on the floor .
4.7992	`` There are many things we do n't want to do that we 've got to do .
7.0579	You stand in your own light , ma'am .
7.8487	I have my rights . ''
49.9141	`` We do n't deny that , sir , '' said Herbert , who enjoyed the squire 's excitement , knowing how it must end .
43.1998	`` I am glad to hear it , '' said the squire ; `` but it appears to me you think you and your mother are the only persons to be considered in this matter . ''
3.6129	`` I think my mother is entitled to some consideration . ''
7.4015	`` Have n't I considered her ?
1.8801	Have n't I offered her a most liberal price for the place ? ''
6.2232	`` We do n't call it liberal . ''
8.7927	`` Then you are unreasonable .
7.1655	Many men in my position would offer less .
12.5433	Indeed , I do n't think I ought to offer more than three hundred dollars . ''
240.7074	`` We would thank you , Squire Leech , if we could see any favor in offering three or four hundred dollars less than the house is worth . ''
1.5489	`` We have had enough of this nonsense , '' said the squire , angrily .
3.9290	`` It is not too late to withdraw my offer . ''
39.7268	`` You had better withdraw it , '' said Herbert , composedly , `` for mother and I have decided to refuse it . ''
8.4932	`` Refuse it ! ''
11.1823	gasped the squire .
6.0347	`` What do you mean by such outrageous impudence ? ''
4.0113	`` I do n't see how it can be considered impudence .
3.9616	We are not obliged to accept every offer made us . ''
34.7619	`` You are obliged to accept this , '' cried Squire Leech , stamping his cane upon the floor again .
4.0359	`` You know there is no help for it . ''
4.8487	`` How do you make that out , sir ? ''
10.7292	inquired our hero .
6.1354	`` You ca n't pay the interest . ''
0.1931	`` I beg your pardon , sir ; we are ready to pay . ''
5.2189	`` I mean the whole of the interest . ''
2.9250	`` So do I. '' `` It must be paid at once . ''
16.8391	`` It shall be paid at once , Squire Leech .
8.1927	Please make out a receipt . ''
18.2374	Squire Leech was never more astonished in his life .
34.4700	He was not convinced till Herbert produced what he could distinguish as two ten-dollar bills and one five .
26.4014	`` There will be two dollars and a half change , '' said Herbert in a business-like manner .
79.6812	`` What did you mean by telling me you could not pay the interest when I was here at twelve o'clock ? ''
1.2946	`` We could not , then , or thought we could not . ''
12.7357	`` Then how can you pay me now ? ''
15.5763	`` We received some money in a letter this morning .
14.5276	The letter had not been opened when you were here , so we did n't know we could meet your claims . ''
26.7539	Squire Leech was very angry .
6.3980	He felt that he had been defeated , and that triumph had slipped over to the other side .
13.0672	But he resolved to make one more attempt .
1.2911	`` I have the right to refuse this money , '' he said .
9.1602	`` It comes too late .
11.8613	It should have been paid at twelve . ''
8.9090	`` I beg your pardon .
0.1899	Squire Leech ; you yourself gave us time to consult what to do . ''
13.1784	`` Because , '' said the squire , unguardedly , `` I thought you could not pay the interest . ''
19.6163	Herbert could not help smiling .
3.4897	`` We have nothing to do with what you thought . ''
7.0523	The squire frowned and bit his lips with vexation .
3.3139	He tried to think of some way of getting over the difficulty but none presented itself .
24.5578	As he dashed off the signature and took the money , he said , angrily : `` The time will come when I will have this place .
0.2216	Your convenient letters wo n't always come just in the nick of time . ''
8.1059	`` I hope to be prepared for you next time , without having to depend on that . ''
9.7017	Still , the squire lingered .
52.4681	The fact was , that , though very angry , he was anxious to know from whom Mrs. Carter had received this opportune help .
7.0575	`` Who sent you this letter ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
3.7419	`` I do n't think we need to tell you that , '' said Herbert .
5.5749	`` I have no objection to tell , '' said Mrs. Carter .
20.9997	`` It was my aunt , Nancy Carter , of Randolph , who so kindly remembered us . ''
29.6536	`` I wish she 'd kept back her letter a day or two , '' thought the squire .
8.6064	`` Is she rich ? ''
9.6828	he asked , abruptly .
29.4161	`` No ; she has a very modest income left by her brother ; but her wants are few , and she thought we might need help .
7.7567	She has a good heart . ''
13.1848	`` Well , ma'am , as my business is over , I will leave you , '' said the squire , sulkily .
34.5082	`` As for that boy of yours , '' pointing his finger at Herbert , `` I advise you to teach him better manners .
7.3949	He wo n't gain anything by his impertinence .
9.8981	If he had acted differently I would have given him employment , or got my superintendent to do so . ''
5.4395	`` I should have been unable to accept it .
19.5027	Squire Leech , '' said Herbert .
6.2115	`` I have made an engagement already . ''
20.3619	The squire had forgotten this , and it was mortifying to expect that his patronage was of no importance to the boy whom he detested .
10.9574	`` Good morning ! ''
67.0146	he said abruptly and left the room `` I am afraid , Herbert , you treated the squire disrespectfully , '' said Mrs. Carter .
8.2122	`` I do n't think so , mother , unless to oppose his wishes is to be disrespectful . ''
4.4459	`` He spoke as if he thought you did . ''
1.4681	`` I know that , but he would n't if he had n't been unreasonable .
7.0021	But I 've got to go to the hotel in fifteen minutes .
2.8678	Just give me a bite , for I 'm awful hungry . ''
48.1974	So the day which Herbert had so much dreaded in advance was marked by two pieces of good luck .
6.8472	When Herbert reached the hotel he went up at once to Mr. Cameron 's room .
24.7449	`` I believe I am a little late , '' he said , apologetically ; `` but I was detained at home by a matter of business . ''
22.9927	`` You are young to have your time occupied by matters of business , '' said the young man , smiling .
14.9465	`` Yes , if my father were alive it would not devolve upon me , but my mother generally consults with me . ''
6.1608	`` I hope your business was arranged satisfactorily . ''
4.5756	`` Yes , but it came near turning out otherwise .
5.3741	I would like to tell you about it . ''
10.8725	`` Do so , '' said Mr. Cameron , kindly .
4.6623	`` I shall be interested in whatever affects you . ''
6.5845	Herbert gave an account of Squire Leech 's attempts to get possession of their cottage .
36.4437	`` But for that letter of Aunt Nancy 's , '' he concluded , `` we should have been obliged to part with our house . ''
8.9014	`` For the paltry sum of twenty-two dollars and a half ? ''
5.9325	`` It was n't paltry to us . ''
7.1911	`` No , to be sure .
23.0393	Why did n't you tell me this morning ?
6.1414	I would have lent you the money . ''
8.0956	`` You would ? ''
21.2871	exclaimed Herbert .
9.4765	`` With pleasure . ''
48.2488	`` Thank you , Mr. Cameron , '' said our hero ; `` but I should n't have dared to ask such a favor of a stranger . ''
13.8706	`` I must tell you that this Squire Leech has probably taken advantage of your ignorance of business .
421.4728	I do n't know exactly how the law is in this State , but I presume that , so far from the squire being authorized to take immediate possession of your place , he would be obliged to give legal notice of sale , on foreclosure of mortgage , by advertisement in some weekly paper .
2.8232	This would allow of sale at auction to the highest bidder . ''
10.4525	`` I did n't know that ; I supposed the squire could order us out immediately and take possession . ''
23.0108	`` Squire Leech certainly knew better than that , but he evidently wanted to frighten your mother into selling to him at a sacrifice . ''
17.2094	`` That was mean , '' said Herbert , indignantly , `` and he a rich man , too . ''
8.0307	`` I quite agree with you , '' said Mr. Cameron .
22.9420	`` If you have any further difficulty with this grasping capitalist , come to me and I will give you the best advice I can . ''
2.7463	`` I will , Mr. Cameron , and thank you for your advice .
8.8463	You have relieved my mind .
7.3635	I will tell mother what you say .
12.0123	What would you like to have me read first ? ''
3.5988	`` We will put off the reading for a short time .
67.5296	I want to ask you a few more questions about yourself , not out of curiosity , but because I may , if I understand your circumstances , some time have it in my power to serve you . ''
8.7205	`` Thank you , sir .
6.6259	I shall be very glad to tell you anything .
6.6138	I was afraid you would not feel interested . ''
7.1214	`` You are my private secretary now and that insures my interest .
8.7606	How long since did your father die ? ''
21.4152	`` A little over a year . ''
7.6614	`` What was his business ? ''
62.2125	`` When he was a young man he was employed in a manufactory near Providence , but the confinement injured his health and he learned the carpenter 's trade . ''
13.1003	`` I should n't think there would be much for a carpenter to do in a small village like this . ''
1.3671	`` My father managed to make a comfortable living but that was all .
55.9397	At the time he died , he considered that our house was mortgaged for only half its value , but Squire Leech thinks otherwise . ''
10.3638	`` Squire Leech wants to get possession of your place .
2.5827	So that was all your father was able to leave you ? ''
41.7488	`` No , not quite all ; there was something else which father seemed to think was worth something , but I am afraid it will never do us any good . ''
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
20.9286	asked Mr. Cameron .
42.0084	`` He was at work in his leisure for the last two years of his life on an invention . ''
9.6477	`` An invention !
9.3577	Of what nature ? ''
5.5959	`` You know I told you he was employed in a cotton manufactory when a young man .
7.7698	This made him familiar with spinning and weaving .
16.6270	He thought he could make an improvement in some of the machinery used and he worked out his idea in a wooden model . ''
7.6365	`` Have you the model ? ''
17.3781	asked Cameron , with interest .
1.4238	`` Yes , sir , and also a written paper describing the invention .
223.3709	A few days before he died father called me to his bedside and told me that he wanted me some day to show his invention to a manufacturer and get his opinion of it .
8.7605	He said that he hoped some time it would be a source of profit to mother and myself . ''
5.2884	`` Have you ever done as he advised ? ''
20.4206	asked Cameron .
7.9523	`` I have never had opportunity .
1.6190	There is no manufacturing town near here and I can not afford to travel . ''
120.7176	`` I am myself the son of a cotton manufacturer , '' said Cameron , `` and , though I have never been employed in the business , I have from my boyhood been accustomed to visit my father 's factory .
7.2841	My opinion may be worth something , therefore .
124.6704	If you are willing to show me your father 's model -- '' `` I shall be very much obliged to you if you will look at it , '' said Herbert .
20.4127	`` I have been afraid that father exaggerated its value and that it might have defects which would prevent its being adopted anywhere . ''
2.4137	`` I will give you my opinion when I have seen it .
14.8789	And now suppose we set to work .
9.0820	Here is a treatise on logic .
19.2335	You may begin and read it very slowly , pausing at the end of every paragraph till I tell you to go on . ''
11.8203	Herbert began to read as he had been requested .
39.0003	For the first two or three times he took very little interest in his subject and thought it very dry .
13.5490	In fact , it was not all he began to re-read the earlier portions that he could comprehend much of it .
91.4241	`` Now , '' said Cameron , after he had read half an hour , `` I have something else for you to do .
3.9607	You are not only my reader , but I must make you my teacher , too . ''
117.9515	Herbert laughed , saying : `` I think you 'll have to get somebody that knows more than I , then ; I would n't venture to teach a college student . ''
6.0786	`` I mean that you shall hear my lessons .
10.3947	I want you to imagine yourself a college professor and ask me questions on what you have just read . ''
6.5362	`` Do you think I can ? ''
2.8730	`` You may bungle a little at first , but you 'll improve .
21.3972	If you do well , when I get through with you I will try to get you a professor 's chair at some college . ''
3.0415	`` I should like that , if professors get well paid . ''
109.5655	`` They generally get more than five dollars a week ; but that is all that I can afford to pay at present . ''
14.1836	`` I 'm only an apprentice , '' said Herbert smiling , `` and am quite satisfied . ''
11.6257	Herbert began to question Cameron on what he had been reading .
54.7915	He did not find it altogether easy , partly from want of practice , partly because the subject was one he knew nothing about .
7.5755	But whenever blunders were made Cameron laughed good-naturedly and the young professor joined in the merriment .
3.1782	`` We 'll take political economy next , '' said the student .
4.0651	`` You wo n't find that so dry as logic . ''
140.5300	Though political economy is generally studied in the junior or senior year at college , its principles , if familiarly illustrated , are not beyond the comprehension of a boy of fifteen .
23.1569	He found himself reading with interest , and when he came to act the role of professor he acquitted himself more creditably than with logic .
20.2337	`` I think , '' said Cameron , `` I shall recommend you for the chair of political economy . ''
10.5198	`` I like it much better , '' said Herbert .
3.0948	`` So do I. Still , logic is important in its way .
15.6066	Tomorrow I must try you on Latin . ''
2.1253	`` I am afraid it wo n't be much use , '' said our hero .
40.7149	`` I have studied it a little two winters when we had a college student keeping our winter school . ''
7.5253	`` If you know as much as that you will answer my purpose better than I anticipated .
16.6977	Now we 'll take a walk .
8.0344	You shall show me the houses of Wrayburn . ''
140.4365	`` The houses of Wrayburn are four in number , '' said Herbert ; `` the two churches , the town hall , and Squire Leech 's house . ''
0.1892	`` There 's another walk which I prefer ; I mean to Prospect Pond .
7.2174	Suppose we walk over to it . ''
9.8086	`` I shall be glad to , '' said Herbert .
7.6596	`` You are a very accommodating professor .
3.8886	You let me off from study when I feel lazy . ''
27.9241	It was a beautiful afternoon and Herbert was satisfied to lay books aside and walk over to Prospect Pond .
9.8928	This pond was about a mile from the village and probably about a mile and a half in circuit .
4.2171	At the farther end was a small hill crowned with forest trees .
3.4818	`` That would be a fine situation for a house . ''
8.2746	`` Yes , '' said Herbert , `` but it would be hard to get at . ''
2.9555	`` Oh , of course a road would have to be built connecting with the highway .
0.2104	Perhaps you will build a house there when you are a rich man . ''
1.0161	`` Then I shall have to wait a few years , '' said Herbert .
3.0266	`` You would n't be the first poor boy that has grown rich .
169.1925	My own father is rich now , but when he was of your age he was only a poor ` bobbin boy ' working at scanty pay in the factory of which he is now owner . ''
7.1623	`` I should like to be rich for my mother 's sake , '' said Herbert .
40.9544	`` With money one can do a great deal of good , though not all rich men choose to apply their riches worthily .
9.8759	How smooth the water is to-day !
5.5054	Is n't there a boat somewhere that we can use ? ''
15.1548	`` There 's one a few rods from here , but it belongs to James Leech . ''
2.2405	`` Would it do to take it , do you think ? ''
3.1164	`` It might do for you but not for me . ''
8.6589	`` Why not for you ? ''
8.9760	`` James and I are not very good friends . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
3.4925	`` He looks down upon me because I am poor . ''
5.1730	`` So he is inclined to put on airs on account of his father 's money ? ''
6.4059	`` I should say he is . ''
2.6042	`` Let us go and see the boat at any rate . ''
26.3629	Herbert led the way through a meadow to a clump of trees , where a small rowboat floated upon the water .
9.7552	`` Does Leech often go out in it ? ''
25.9533	`` Two or three times a week . ''
20.0638	`` It is just about large enough for two , though it would easily accommodate one more . ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
42.0756	`` If I thought your friend would not be round I should be tempted to try it for half an hour . ''
7.3846	`` I think you might venture . ''
2.4625	`` Jump in , then , and we 'll push out . ''
19.0658	Herbert shook his head .
110.0056	`` If the boat belonged to anyone but James Leech I would go ; but I do n't like him well enough to take any liberty with anything of his . ''
9.0102	`` Perhaps you are right .
19.6547	Would you mind sitting down and waiting for me twenty minutes or half an hour ? ''
3.9034	`` Oh , no ; it will be pleasant . ''
9.0095	`` Then here goes . ''
33.2232	Cameron jumped into the boat , pushed off and began to row in a style that showed he was accustomed to the exercise .
5.3170	The pond was so small that it was not easy for him to get out of sight .
89.1457	Herbert sat down , not without a secret longing to be in the boat also ; but he did not care to place himself under any obligations to James .
7.7462	Suddenly he heard a hasty step behind him .
1.5551	Looking up , he saw the owner of the boat close at hand .
7.3775	James Leech looked for his boat and saw that it was gone .
9.0755	Then his gaze fell upon our hero .
7.3301	`` What have you done with my boat , Carter ? ''
10.0972	he demanded , peremptorily .
7.1376	`` What makes you ask such a question , Leech ? ''
20.8872	answered Herbert .
13.7136	`` Why do you call me Leech ? ''
19.1951	said James , angrily .
2.5434	`` For the same reason you call me Carter , I suppose . ''
5.1530	`` There 's a great difference between us , '' said James .
13.4496	`` That 's true , '' assented Herbert .
3.8324	`` And you ought to treat me with proper respect . ''
3.4300	`` I treat you with all the respect you deserve . ''
7.7549	`` You have n't answered my question , '' said James .
9.1707	`` What question ? ''
8.4580	`` Where is my boat ? ''
9.2858	`` Out on the pond .
6.6616	Look and you will see it . ''
28.1707	James looked where Herbert pointed .
8.0709	`` Who is that in that boat ? ''
9.8813	he demanded , angrily .
18.0153	`` Mr. Cameron . ''
7.4882	`` Who 's he ? ''
7.5542	`` A boarder at the hotel . ''
15.1006	`` Is it the young man from Yale College ?
31.1926	My father was speaking of him this morning , '' said James , moderating his tone very considerably .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
8.3144	`` Then I do n't mind .
7.8851	My father says he is very rich .
3.1855	I suppose I shall be introduced to him soon , '' said James , complacently .
58.3758	`` If you will wait a few minutes till he comes ashore I will introduce you , '' said Herbert .
9.2169	`` You !
6.9940	What do you know of him ? ''
21.7349	sneered James .
9.9926	`` I passed the afternoon with him , '' said Herbert .
5.5451	`` He must be hard up for company , '' said James .
94.0161	`` Look here , James Leech , '' said Herbert his eyes flashing ; `` I 've had enough of that kind of talk .
6.0837	I do n't intend to submit to your impudence .
1.8320	When you speak to me keep a civil tongue in your head . ''
9.0392	`` I never heard such impudence .
4.3767	What do you mean by addressing me in that style ? ''
8.6724	`` What do I mean ?
5.5899	I mean to warn you to be civil . ''
17.0917	`` Look here , Carter !
24.8576	I 'll tell my father and he 'll turn you out of house and home , '' exclaimed James , furiously .
5.2540	`` He has n't the power , fortunately . ''
3.5108	`` Has n't he got a mortgage on your place ? ''
20.8874	`` Yes ; but the interest was paid to-day and no more will be due for six months . ''
3.1279	`` Where did you get the money to pay the interest ? ''
6.1366	`` That is no business of yours .
23.3837	It is enough for you to know that it is paid and that your father has no more control over us than we have over him . ''
19.5367	James was disappointed .
47.7046	He had expected that the interest would not be paid and that Mrs. Carter and Herbert would be at his father 's mercy .
5.2373	It was certainly surprising that they had raised the money .
13.5977	`` Are you waiting here for Mr. Cameron ? ''
20.4206	asked James .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
5.1699	`` I do n't think you need to . ''
15.0447	`` As you do n't even know him , I do n't think your opinions as to his wishes of much importance . ''
0.1655	`` I would n't thrust myself on him , if I were you . ''
4.2820	`` Thank you , I do n't intend to . ''
4.8054	`` I suppose you fell in with him by accident .
5.1965	He probably do n't know who you are . ''
5.6905	`` Oh , yes , he does .
7.8802	He knows all about me .
50.3338	I am going to spend to-morrow afternoon with him also , '' said Herbert , delighting to mystify his companion .
4.0753	`` He wo n't care to have you call much longer .
11.5928	My aunt has written to my father about him and he will invite Mr. Cameron to call . ''
34.4969	`` I have no objection but I do n't think it will make any difference as I am Mr. Cameron 's private secretary . ''
11.6824	`` Private secretary !
8.4464	What do you do ? ''
17.3471	`` I read to him , as his eyes are poor , and I suppose I shall write for him when he needs it . ''
6.8632	`` What does he pay you ? ''
4.5324	`` I do n't know as that concerns you particularly .
6.8852	Still , I do n't mind telling you .
26.0980	He pays me five dollars a week . ''
2.7415	`` That 's a good deal more than you 're worth . ''
5.4242	`` I think so myself , especially as I only spend the afternoon with him . ''
4.2055	James was quite annoyed to find that the boy he disliked was prospering so well .
18.6215	He was about to make another unpleasant remark when Herbert suddenly exclaimed : `` He 's turned the boat .
9.9949	Does n't he row beautifully ? ''
11.3795	The same thought sprang up in the minds of both boys : `` I wish I could row like that . ''
9.3533	The little boat touched its moorings .
84.1088	`` Mr. Cameron , '' said Herbert , `` allow me to introduce to you the owner of the boat , Mr. James Leech . ''
35.9297	`` Mr. Leech , '' said Cameron , `` I have to apologize for taking your boat without leave .
3.7367	I hope I have n't kept you waiting for it . ''
98.3953	If the young collegian had not been the son of a wealthy man , whose social position was higher than his own , James would not so readily have accepted the apology .
1.2700	As it was , he said , graciously : `` Oh it 's no matter .
7.8207	I 'm glad you took the boat .
12.9824	How beautifully you row ! ''
8.2356	`` Thank you for the compliment .
20.1594	Last year I belonged to the Sophomore crew at Yale . ''
4.2581	`` I wish I could row as well as you . ''
6.7437	`` It is a matter of practice .
1.6864	If I can give you any hints I shall be glad to do so . ''
10.8156	`` Thank you , '' said James , eagerly .
23.0867	`` Would you have time this afternoon ? ''
14.1570	`` Yes , I have an hour to spare .
64.7288	If you and my friend Herbert will get into the boat and row out a little way , I shall get an idea of your style of rowing . ''
36.2330	`` I would rather row out alone , '' said James , haughtily , with a disparaging look at Herbert .
7.3210	`` Unfortunately that wo n't do as well .
15.3549	You must learn to row with one oar first . ''
3.7890	`` Then suppose you get into the boat with me . ''
7.3712	`` That wo n't do as well .
8.5181	I am much heavier than you .
12.4473	Now you and Herbert are about the same weight . ''
96.4395	`` Very well , then , '' said James , and turning to Herbert , he said , ungraciously : `` Will you row with me ? ''
10.2326	`` If you desire it , '' said Herbert .
7.4203	`` Get in , then . ''
10.8113	When they returned Cameron made some criticisms Upon their rowing .
34.0285	They started out again but Herbert profited better by the instructions he had received and the young collegian said so when they returned .
130.4980	James was far from liking this and when Cameron asked him if he would try another row he answered : `` No , I am tired of it . ''
17.7918	`` If you get tired so soon , I am afraid you will have to strengthen your arms by gymnastic exercises . ''
6.8700	`` Oh , I am not tired .
7.8813	I do n't feel like rowing . ''
6.2744	`` Then suppose we walk back to the village .
8.0930	Does your way lie with ours ? ''
10.1536	`` Nearly all the way , '' said James .
42.3555	He enjoyed the idea of walking with the collegian , but it was rather a drawback that Herbert was to share that pleasure with him .
5.8058	Still he could not very well suggest that Herbert should leave them .
5.0111	`` Have you seen my father 's house ? ''
20.4206	asked James .
5.9542	`` Perhaps , without knowing whose it was . ''
7.0783	`` You could n't help knowing it .
2.7643	It is the best in the village , '' said James , pompously .
18.4294	Cameron looked at him curiously .
38.5615	`` If he comes to Yale , '' he thought , `` and puts on these airs , he 'll be taken down without ceremony . ''
8.0656	`` Oh , indeed ! ''
9.9164	he said aloud , dryly .
6.9437	`` Are you going to stay here long ? ''
20.4206	asked James .
9.5742	`` I ca n't say how long .
6.9396	I am here for my health . ''
6.5941	`` You must come and see us .
6.0371	My father will be very glad to see you .
6.0631	My aunt has written us about you . ''
11.0629	`` Indeed !
18.4632	May I ask your aunt 's name ? ''
19.5489	`` Her name is Davenport -- Mrs. John Davenport .
20.8864	She lives in New Haven . ''
3.5146	`` Oh , yes , I have met her . ''
17.6782	Cameron smiled to himself .
57.1852	The lady referred to was not unlike her brother and nephew , being pompous and presuming -- one , indeed , whom he secretly disliked .
7.7760	`` She wants me to prepare for Yale , '' said James .
45.1719	`` Of course we Yale men are biased , but we think no student can do better than to come to Yale . ''
0.1815	`` My father wants me to be a professional man -- a lawyer . ''
9.8221	`` A good profession .
7.4716	Do you think you should like it ? ''
12.2038	`` Yes , '' said James , complacently .
7.8438	`` It 's a very genteel profession .
6.3061	Besides , most of our public men are lawyers .
4.2474	I might stand a chance to get into public life . ''
8.2375	`` Should you like it ? ''
4.5338	`` Yes , I should like to be a member of Congress .
32.5421	My father has a good deal of influence and I am his only son , so I should have a very good chance ; do n't you think so ? ''
0.4415	`` It would seem so , '' said Cameron , with a quiet smile .
10.9405	`` I think you had better come to Yale .
6.2761	You would be improved in many ways . ''
71.8646	He referred to the possibility of James having some of the self-conceit taken out of him ; but then the squire 's son interpreted the remark as a compliment .
4.9811	`` Have you ever thought of going to college , Herbert ? ''
14.7623	asked Cameron , turning to our hero .
39.9534	`` I always thought I should like to go , '' answered Herbert , `` but I never thought there was any chance of it . ''
22.5452	James laughed scornfully .
3.1166	`` No , I should think not , '' he said .
9.9607	`` Why ? ''
12.5458	asked Cameron , meaning to draw him out .
11.8897	`` He 's too poor , '' said James .
1.2564	`` You , I suppose , have no trouble in that way ? ''
8.7292	`` My father is the richest man in Wrayburn . ''
3.9632	`` That is lucky for you , '' said the collegian .
5.4478	`` I should n't like to be as poor as Carter . ''
6.1184	`` It is n't pleasant or convenient to be poor , '' said Herbert , quietly .
4.7290	`` I do n't mean always to be poor . ''
11.3997	`` You probably will be , '' said James .
6.8023	`` Poor boys do n't always stay poor . ''
3.5369	`` There is n't much chance for you to rise . ''
10.2978	`` I do n't know why , '' said Herbert .
83.4074	`` Then it seems , Herbert , '' said Cameron , smiling , `` there is not much chance of my welcoming you at Yale . ''
7.0797	`` I wish there was . ''
1.8369	`` So you will have to be content with serving as my professor here . ''
102.7513	James did not understand this allusion , but privately wondered how Cameron could talk so intimately with a boy in Herbert 's low social position .
5.0218	`` I turn off here , '' he said .
6.8479	`` That is our house . ''
8.1541	`` Is it ? ''
19.4157	said Cameron , indifferently .
75.9729	`` Your friend seems to have a very vain idea of his high position , '' said Cameron , when James was out of hearing .
5.1739	`` And a very low idea of mine , '' added Herbert .
7.3227	`` Does that disturb you ? ''
9.5389	`` A little .
5.2071	He carries it so far as to be annoying . ''
6.0995	`` Circumstances may change with you both . ''
7.1696	`` I hope they may with me , '' said Herbert .
13.3590	`` I do n't want James to come down in the world , but I hope to rise . ''
373.8909	The next day Cameron was honored by a special call from Squire Leech , who left an invitation for the young collegian to take tea with him the following afternoon .
19.0180	This invitation Cameron accepted .
171.9319	About half-past four o'clock one afternoon a tall , dark-complexioned man , wearing a white hat , inscribed his name in the register of the Wrayburn hotel .
12.1892	`` Can you tell here Mr. Leech lives ? ''
9.0438	he inquired of the landlord .
13.6910	`` He lives about a quarter of a mile from here .
2.4423	I can send some one with you to show you the house . ''
23.1378	Just then Herbert came downstairs from Mr. Cameron .
48.4597	`` Herbert , '' said the landlord , `` here is a gentleman wants to go to Squire Leech 's .
7.5153	Would you mind showing him the way ? ''
0.1997	`` I will do so with pleasure , '' said our hero , politely .
10.8827	`` Are you ready to go now , sir ? ''
6.9078	`` Yes , '' said the stranger .
1.6000	`` Landlord , please assign me a room and have my bag carried up . ''
8.5848	`` All right , sir . ''
10.4344	`` Now , my lad , I am ready .
6.3204	It is n't far , is it ? ''
5.2053	`` About five minutes ' walk -- that is all , sir . ''
5.0944	`` I never was in Wrayburn -- much going on here ? ''
9.4915	`` Not much , sir .
7.7581	It is a quiet town . ''
29.6085	`` Mr. Leech -- Squire Leech , I think you call him -- was an old schoolmate of mine .
19.5247	We went to the Brandon Academy together .
6.0421	I suppose he is rich , eh ? ''
10.1196	`` He is the richest man in Wrayburn . ''
6.5672	`` I am glad to hear it , '' said the other , in a tone of satisfaction .
6.0346	`` What do you think he is worth ? ''
20.1178	`` Some say a hundred thousand dollars . ''
9.4141	`` Very good ! ''
36.3001	commented Andrew Temple , for this was his name in the hotel register -- `` for the country , I mean .
3.5773	In the city that would n't make a rich man . ''
7.9499	`` Would n't it ? ''
8.5906	asked Herbert , who had supposed a man worth a hundred thousand dollars rich anywhere .
6.6999	`` No , to be sure not .
7.1562	It costs a great deal more to live .
29.0409	Why , I myself am worth something like that ; but in New York nobody regards me as rich . ''
10.8468	`` I should feel rich with ten thousand , '' said Herbert .
10.4946	`` That would about pay my expenses for a year . ''
6.9915	`` Squire Leech does n't spend anywhere near that .
7.3081	I do n't believe it costs him two thousand dollars a year . ''
10.9181	`` Very likely .
0.1838	There 's a great deal of difference between the country and the city . ''
4.2393	`` Is it easy to make money in the city ? ''
20.4206	asked Herbert .
1.4464	`` Yes , if a man is sharp and has some money to start with .
7.9350	Do you think of going there ? ''
4.6929	`` I am afraid it would be of no use .
4.4266	I have no money to start with , and I am afraid I am not smart . ''
5.5545	`` Wait and I may give you a lift .
8.7063	Here 's my card . ''
17.6321	`` Thank you , sir , '' said Herbert , as he read : `` Andrew Temple , No .
28.4476	-- Nassau Street , Room 12 . ''
3.3170	`` That 's my office ; I speculate in stocks . ''
9.5532	`` Is that a good business ? ''
7.0295	`` Capital , if you know the ropes .
1.7594	If you ever come to the city , call at my office . ''
8.7205	`` Thank you , sir .
20.6709	Here is Squire Leech 's house . ''
6.9010	`` I am much obliged to you .
29.0913	Allow me to compensate you for your trouble '' ; and Mr. Temple thrust his thumb and forefinger into his vest pocket .
10.9848	`` Oh , no , sir , I do n't want pay , '' said Herbert , hurriedly .
12.2786	Mr. Temple had made the offer as a matter of form and was relieved to find it declined .
3.7956	He said `` good-night '' graciously and advanced to the front door .
9.2481	`` Is Squire Leech at home ? ''
8.9381	he inquired of the servant .
6.2429	`` Yes , sir ; I believe so .
7.9082	Wo n't you walk in ? ''
9.6123	`` Thank you .
8.2463	Please hand your master that card . ''
0.8036	Squire Leech did not recall Mr. Temple 's name , and greeted him distantly .
22.1438	Not so Mr. Temple .
4.3499	He rose , and shook the squire 's passive hand energetically .
0.4037	`` Why , Leech , it seems like old times seeing you again . ''
2.5538	`` You have the advantage of me , '' said the squire .
0.5944	`` You do n't mean to say you 've forgotten Temple -- Andrew Temple ?
5.2610	Why , we were at the Brandon Academy together . ''
5.5440	`` I suppose I ought to remember you . ''
8.0103	`` To be sure you ought .
17.9335	We were very good friends in the old days . ''
106.1277	One reason of the squire 's distant manner was that Mr. Temple , though a rich man according to his own account , had a somewhat seedy look .
8.1962	The squire was afraid he intended to ask for help on the score of old friendship .
15.0002	It was with a hesitating voice , therefore , that he asked : `` How has the world treated you ? ''
5.5651	`` I am not rich , to be sure .
297.1135	Probably I am not worth more than a hundred thousand dollars , at the outside ; but before five years roll over my head , I see my way clear to half a million . ''
25.8047	Squire Leech 's manner changed instantaneously .
1.3414	`` I am glad to see you , '' he said , cordially .
6.6458	`` How long have you been in town ? ''
10.0115	`` Only just arrived .
3.7437	I inquired my way here as soon as I heard that you were living here . ''
7.4547	`` Are you at the hotel ? ''
9.2169	`` Yes .
8.3781	I left my luggage there . ''
6.0774	`` You must come and stop with me .
7.7307	We will talk over old times . ''
0.2569	`` Thank you ; it would be much pleasanter for me , of course .
3.0363	In fact , I came to Wrayburn on account of your being here .
17.1738	I happened to be in the neighborhood , and I said ' I must see Leech at any rate . '
9.6470	So here I am .
5.7015	Fortune has smiled on you , I hope ? ''
1.3406	`` Yes , '' said the squire , `` I am comfortable . ''
9.1770	`` The boy that guided me here said that you were the richest man in Wrayburn . ''
2.5318	`` I believe I am , '' said the squire , complacently .
3.6828	`` I am worth somewhere about the same as you . ''
1.2361	`` That 's fair ; it is more for you than for me .
0.9351	It costs me ten thousand dollars a year to live in the city . ''
8.4510	`` Does it ? ''
21.2847	inquired Leech .
43.3035	`` I 've sometimes thought of going to the country , where my expenses would be much less ; but , after all , you can make much more money in the city . ''
2.8811	`` You think there are opportunities of making money rapidly there ? ''
10.3980	asked his companion .
7.2974	`` No doubt of it . ''
1.6817	`` I should like to talk with you on that subject after supper .
7.7609	Now , I will go and tell Mrs. Leech you are here .
6.2055	We will send for your carpetbag after supper . ''
24.2707	Squire Leech was a covetous man .
7.7008	He had a passion for money-making and he had availed himself of all the opportunities which the country afforded .
6.5587	He had about as much property as his friend .
3.8619	He began to think he had been plodding along in a very slow , unsatisfactory manner .
13.2951	He would make careful inquiries and perhaps Temple would put him in the way of doubling his money .
152.3179	Upon the whole , therefore , he was very glad to see Mr. Temple , and introduced him to his wife and son as an old schoolmate with whom he had once been very intimate .
93.5733	`` This is my son , James , Mr. Temple , '' said the squire , as the young gentleman came in to supper a little late .
11.0629	`` Indeed !
16.0238	How old are you , James ? ''
128.1364	James took in at a glance the visitor 's appearance , which did not give the impression of prosperity , and answered , with haughty condescension : `` I am almost sixteen . ''
7.8627	`` I congratulate you , Mr. Leech , '' said Temple .
6.6964	`` I am not blessed with a son .
26.3119	I would gladly give twenty thousand dollars could I have a son of your boy 's age . ''
18.0026	James pricked up his ears .
9.8182	Temple spoke as if he had the twenty thousand dollars to give .
2.7117	He must be a man of property and so entitled to respect .
3.8676	`` What are you going to do with your boy ? ''
8.2875	`` I have not decided .
7.4086	Perhaps he may go to college . ''
5.5211	`` I think I shall be a lawyer , '' said James .
9.8221	`` A good profession .
13.7022	Some of our New York lawyers make great incomes . ''
19.9339	`` Do you live in New York ? ''
20.4206	asked James .
6.1718	`` Yes ; that is my residence .
0.1921	You must establish yourself in the city when you are ready to practice . ''
19.1707	`` That is just what I want to do ; I do n't want to bury myself in a one-horse country town like this . ''
3.0946	`` And be a one-horse lawyer , '' suggested Temple , laughing .
8.3173	`` Quite right , my young friend .
1.5237	In the city alone you will find a broad field of action . ''
5.2257	`` That 's just the way I think , '' said James .
17.0070	`` I need n't say I would do all in my power to push you , and I flatter myself I have some influence . ''
106.2510	`` You are very kind , Mr. Temple , '' said Mrs. Leech ; `` but I hoped that James could still continue to live with us . ''
15.1061	`` You ca n't expect me to live at home all my life , '' said James , impatiently .
5.1148	`` Perhaps your husband may be persuaded himself to remove to the city , '' said Temple .
8.9094	`` I really think he stands in his own light in staying in a small place like this . ''
64.4344	`` Just so , '' said James , who would have liked nothing better than to live in New York .
7.6650	`` There is no society here .
3.8261	I have no boys to associate with in my own position .
10.8872	Why wo n't you move to New York , father ? ''
17.1272	`` That requires consideration , '' said Squire Leech .
7.0430	`` I should like to talk with you on that subject after supper , '' said Temple .
3.5792	`` Mrs. Leech , may I ask for another cup of tea ? ''
19.9473	When supper was over Squire Leech led the way into the sitting room , and his guest followed .
35.2316	The vista of future wealth which his visitor had opened to him had not been without its effect and he began to make inquiries .
39.3464	`` I suppose , '' he said , `` there are ways of investing money to good advantage in New York ? ''
7.5496	`` Most certainly -- many ways . ''
9.7878	`` Real estate ? ''
2.3548	`` That may do , but it is too slow for me .
9.5304	I owned a house uptown .
28.1167	I sold for thirty thousand dollars .
11.0024	In six weeks I made twenty thousand more out of it . ''
8.4147	`` Is it possible ? ''
11.1869	ejaculated the squire .
15.9369	`` Twenty thousand , did you say ? ''
9.6500	`` To be sure .
8.3624	Of course that was extra good luck .
9.7627	You ca n't expect to do as well often , but there are always ways of turning over capital . ''
3.8696	`` May I ask in what way you made this large sum ? ''
9.6500	`` To be sure .
10.0551	I speculated in Erie .
7.6515	It is all the time fluctuating .
5.8127	I became convinced that it was on the rise .
4.5652	I went in and the event justified my action . ''
0.2121	Temple spoke quietly , as if it were no great matter , after all .
7.0606	His host was very much impressed , and felt like a man who has discovered a gold mine .
268.0265	He had succeeded in saving up about two thousand dollars a year for some years ; but what was that to twenty thousand dollars made in six weeks ?
10.1835	Still , prudence led him to suggest : `` But is n't there danger of losing heavily ? ''
5.3227	`` Not if you are acquainted with the stock market .
6.7487	It is the ignoramuses that get bit . ''
5.3035	`` I know very little of the stock market myself , '' confessed Squire Leech .
7.2847	`` I own some bank stocks . ''
5.3729	`` No money to be made in bank stocks . ''
8.4045	`` They pay good dividends . ''
1.3700	`` No doubt ; but there is little or no variation in value .
4.6865	It 's fluctuation that gives a man a chance . ''
13.8573	`` I should be as likely to lose as gain , knowing as little as I do of the market . ''
1.6825	`` True ; but I should be happy to place my knowledge at your disposal .
0.2286	As an old friend and schoolmate I naturally feel interested in your prosperity . ''
15.9305	`` You are very kind , '' said the squire ; `` but would n't it be too much trouble ? ''
9.2118	`` Not at all .
3.1563	In fact , it 's my business , and would n't inconvenience me in the least .
5.7164	By the way , how is your property invested ? ''
10.7706	asked Temple , carelessly .
9.3908	`` Mostly in real estate . ''
6.8953	`` It must pay you very little . ''
8.7393	`` That is true .
3.1701	After deducting taxes and repairs , there is very little left . ''
9.7009	`` So I supposed .
11.1042	It would pay you to mortgage your property , or sell it , and use the money in Wall Street . ''
13.1162	`` I have about twenty thousand dollars in bank stock . ''
7.1442	`` That could readily be sold . ''
7.8073	`` What investments would you suggest ? ''
16.8272	`` I could n't tell you on the moment ; but I think favorably of a mining stock lately put on the market .
47.2011	I have private advices that it is likely to develop extraordinary richness and the stock may even treble in three months . ''
8.4916	`` Where is the mine ? ''
9.9221	asked the squire , eagerly .
18.2527	`` Out in Nevada .
11.9742	A friend of mine has just returned from there and he has given me strictly confidential information in regard to it .
31.1383	He has so much faith in it that he has bought fifteen thousand dollars ' worth of shares . ''
7.9259	`` Could I get any ? ''
28.3784	asked Squire Leech .
4.0733	`` I think you could if you go to work quietly .
8.2611	If you went into the market openly , they would suspect something and raise the price on you . ''
7.3696	`` Yes , I see .
17.5741	Do you think that is better than Erie ? ''
10.0733	`` At present , nothing is to be made in Erie .
5.2228	It is likely to go down before it goes up .
0.3943	The time may come when you can buy to advantage but not now . ''
18.4426	`` I have a great mind to go up to the city with you , and investigate the matter , '' said the squire .
7.0413	`` Do so , by all means .
3.2220	I shall be delighted , and will cheerfully render you all the assistance in my power .
0.3632	But , my friend , let me give you one piece of advice . ''
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
3.2309	`` Say as little as possible to your wife on the subject .
9.7984	Women do n't understand business .
4.2053	They are frightened at risks and do n't understand speculation . ''
3.9060	`` I think you are correct , '' said his host .
8.1829	`` Men must judge for themselves .
1.4635	It is a weak man who would be guided by his wife . ''
9.3276	`` So I say .
14.3535	Why , my wife happened to learn that I had gone into Erie on the occasion I mentioned .
76.2287	She remonstrated in great alarm ; but when I announced that I had cleared twenty thousand dollars , she had no more to say . ''
142.2856	The next day they went to New York together and within a week the squire had bought largely in the Nevada mine .
5.0099	He subscribed to a financial paper , and was fully embarked on the dangerous sea of speculation .
6.0318	In accordance with the invitation , Cameron walked to supper with Squire Leech .
17.2981	His social position as the son of a rich manufacturer insured him a cordial welcome and great attention from the whole family .
7.1405	`` You must find our village very dull , Mr. Cameron , '' said his host .
2.7348	`` Oh , no , sir ; I think I shall enjoy it very well . ''
0.2003	`` We have very little good society , I am sorry to say . ''
6.3500	`` That 's so , father , '' broke in James .
4.2854	`` I wish you would move to the city . ''
23.6275	`` That may come some day , '' said his father , thinking of Mr. Temple and his operations .
8.5265	`` How do you occupy your time , Mr. Cameron ? ''
21.1058	asked Mrs. Leech .
7.8736	`` I walk about in the forenoon .
3.5554	In the afternoon I am occupied with my professor , '' answered the young man .
8.6211	`` Your professor ! ''
8.6985	repeated the lady , in surprise .
11.9524	`` Is one of your college professors staying here ? ''
4.7001	`` No ; they are too busy to leave New Haven .
12.6002	I refer to my young reader , Herbert Carter . ''
24.2788	`` Herbert Carter ! ''
20.2315	repeated James , scornfully .
40.6066	`` Yes , '' said Cameron , ignoring the scorn ; `` he reads my lessons to me and then questions me upon them .
5.4114	That is why I call him my professor . ''
1.9067	`` I should hardly think you would find him competent , '' said the squire .
5.1756	`` He do n't know much , '' said James , contemptuously .
4.9098	`` On the contrary , I find him very intelligent .
5.2645	He reads clearly and distinctly , and I congratulate myself on obtaining so satisfactory an assistant . ''
162.1436	Squire Leech shrugged his shoulders and had too much wisdom to continue detracting from Herbert 's merits , seeing that his guest seemed determined to think well of him .
20.9865	Not so James .
1.3213	`` He is from a low family , '' he said , spitefully .
9.6805	`` Low ? ''
19.8359	interrogated Cameron , significantly .
7.3160	`` His mother is very poor . ''
7.0697	`` That 's a very different thing , '' observed Cameron .
3.4241	`` Mrs. Carter is a very respectable person , '' said the squire , condescendingly .
44.8370	`` Indeed , I have offered to relieve her by taking her house at a high valuation ; but , under a mistaken idea of her own interest , she refuses to sell . ''
2.6709	`` But you 'll get it finally , father , '' asked James .
17.4424	`` I shall probably have to take it in the end , as I have a mortgage on it for nearly its value . ''
11.8617	Cameron looked down upon his plate and said nothing .
45.4293	`` My son will be happy to accompany you about the neighborhood , Mr. Cameron , '' said Squire Leech .
3.6593	`` I can go round with you ` most any time , '' said James .
8.7502	`` Thank you both .
7.1832	You are very kind , '' said Cameron , politely , but without expressing any pleasure .
109.3220	`` I think I may send James to Yale , '' observed his host , `` I have a high idea of your college , Mr. Cameron . ''
9.6123	`` Thank you .
7.4850	I think your son could hardly fail of deriving benefit from a residence at Yale . ''
6.0829	`` James is my only child and I intend him to enjoy the greatest educational advantages .
3.8295	I should like to have him become a professional man . ''
17.7091	`` I should like to be a lawyer ; that 's a very gentlemanly profession , '' said James .
6.2407	`` You might rise to be a judge , '' said Cameron , with a smile .
20.7761	`` Very likely , '' said James , in a matter-of-course way , that amused the young man exceedingly .
7.8475	`` What an odious young cub ! ''
12.8501	he said to himself , as he wended his way back to the hotel at ten o'clock .
2.7215	`` I never met such a combination of pride and self-conceit . ''
16.5968	James thought Cameron had taken a fancy to him .
16.6490	`` He must get awfully tired of that low-bred Herbert Carter , '' he said to himself .
9.1902	`` I guess I 'll go round tomorrow morning and take a walk with him . ''
11.0303	He met Cameron on the steps of the hotel .
0.1709	`` I thought I 'd come and walk with you , '' he said .
14.4795	`` Very well , '' said Cameron .
7.6041	`` Do you know the way to Mr. Crane 's ? ''
7.9581	`` The carpenter 's ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
7.9330	`` There 's nothing to see there , '' said James .
8.9090	`` I beg your pardon .
10.6749	I want to see Herbert at his work . ''
2.9851	`` Oh , well , I 'll show you the way , '' said James .
15.1508	Herbert was hard at work when the two came up .
7.5670	`` How are you , professor ? ''
20.4206	asked Cameron .
17.5643	`` Very well , Mr. Cameron .
15.9019	How are you , James ? ''
40.7810	`` I 'm well enough , '' answered James , who always found it hard to be decently civil to our hero .
7.0603	`` Do n't you get tired working ? ''
17.3585	`` I have n't worked long enough this morning for that .
11.4547	I dare say I shall be tired before noon . ''
8.0061	`` Then your other work will begin , '' said Cameron .
3.8496	`` That kind of work will be a rest to me , it 's so different . ''
1.5259	`` If you had an extra hoe I would help you a little .
3.9556	It would be as good as exercise in the gymnasium . ''
245.5355	`` Perhaps I could borrow two and so employ both of you , '' remarked Herbert , with a glance at James , who was sprucely dressed and wore a flower in his buttonhole .
8.3152	`` None for me , thank you , '' said James , with a look of disgust .
4.5848	`` I do n't intend to become a laborer . ''
0.4462	`` You 'll have to labor if you study law , '' said Cameron .
2.6710	`` That 's genteel ; besides I do n't call it labor .
15.7561	Shall we go on , Mr. Cameron ? ''
10.5542	`` Not just yet .
12.5351	I want to watch Herbert a little longer . ''
10.5121	So he lingered , much to the dissatisfaction of James .
6.3348	`` Wo n't you go out rowing ? ''
6.8643	he asked , when they were walking away .
19.4656	`` I have no objection , '' said Cameron ; and they spent an hour on the pond .
2.9886	`` Do you think I can get into the crew if I go to Yale ? ''
20.3037	asked James , complacently .
2.7387	`` I should say not , unless you improve in rowing . ''
7.3713	`` Do n't I row well ? ''
7.7531	`` There is considerable room for improvement .
5.2963	However , you have time enough for that . ''
22.3838	They were cruising near the shore when a boy of ten came down to the bank and called out to them .
22.2262	`` James , '' he said , `` will you let me go across in the boat with you ? ''
9.1674	`` Why should I ? ''
14.2490	demanded James , not very amicably , for the boy belonged to what he termed the lower classes .
6.0318	`` Do let me , '' urged the boy .
4.1011	`` I left mother very sick and went for the doctor .
3.0837	She was all alone and I want to get back as soon as I can . ''
169.6500	By the road the boy would have to walk about a mile and a quarter , while he could be rowed across the pond in six or seven minutes .
9.1615	`` I ca n't take anybody and everybody in my boat , '' said James , disagreeably .
8.2212	`` Go ahead and walk . ''
11.3715	`` How can you refuse the boy , when he wants to get home to his sick mother ? ''
19.4747	said Cameron , indignantly .
0.1746	`` Jump in , my boy , and we 'll take you over . ''
2.7105	`` I do n't know about that , '' said James , sullenly .
9.4391	`` Look here ! ''
18.6404	said Cameron , shortly .
16.7713	`` Refuse this boy and I shall get out of the boat immediately and refuse hereafter to be seen in your company . ''
21.6412	James was disagreeably surprised .
5.0089	`` Jump in , my boy , '' said Cameron , kindly .
2.6593	`` Thank you , sir , '' said the boy , gratefully .
22.0032	James was not a little mortified at the snubbing he had received , but he did not venture to expostulate .
37.4008	Cameron was fond of boating , but did not care to be indebted to James for the loan of his boat .
65.8875	`` I 'll have a boat sent on to me , '' he secretly determined , `` and when I leave Wrayburn I 'll give it to Herbert . ''
14.9589	Herbert worked steadily every forenoon on his farm .
55.5989	Cameron then proposed that they should take the forenoon for their studies and walk out or exercise in some other way in the afternoon .
87.6321	One afternoon Cameron said : `` Let us take a walk to Prospect Pond ; I think I should enjoy a little rowing . ''
98.1549	`` I will accompany you with pleasure , Mr. Cameron , '' said Herbert , `` but do n't ask me to go out in the boat with you . ''
10.9579	`` Why not ?
7.6816	Are you afraid I will upset you ? ''
0.3485	`` No , '' answered Herbert ; `` I have confidence in your skill .
8.3082	Besides , I can swim . ''
6.6480	`` What is your objection , then ? ''
4.8811	`` If the boat belonged to anyone but James Leech I would not mind . ''
8.9143	`` Why should you mind that ? ''
17.1102	`` I met him last evening and he told me not to get into his boat again .
9.0054	He said he was perfectly willing you should use it , but he did n't choose to have me . ''
58.8484	`` It appears that I am a greater favorite with James Leech than you are , '' said Cameron , smiling .
3.5386	`` He looks down upon me as a poor boy . ''
34.7633	`` Well , I suppose James is entitled to his prejudice ; but if you ca n't use the boat , I wo n't . ''
20.7437	`` Do n't let that interfere with your pleasure , Mr. Cameron , '' said Herbert , eagerly .
6.2361	`` I do n't trouble myself in the least about the way James treats me . ''
2.5345	`` Let us go down to the pond , at any rate .
2.8059	We can sit down on the bank , if nothing better . ''
8.7131	`` All right . ''
3.9460	An easy walk brought them to the edge of the pond .
26.5480	Herbert naturally looked for James Leech 's boat .
70.3426	He thought something was the matter with his eyes , for where there should be but one boat there were now two .
6.1498	`` Why , there 's another boat ! ''
10.5460	he exclaimed .
8.1541	`` Is there ? ''
19.8736	asked Cameron , indifferently .
4.6178	`` Yes , do n't you see it ? ''
2.3948	`` Well , it does look like a boat , I admit .
4.8454	I should say it was nicer than the other . ''
7.3018	`` I should say it was .
8.1643	Is n't she a regular beauty ? ''
20.3462	exclaimed Herbert , enthusiastically .
7.2157	`` I wonder whose it is ?
22.7039	James would n't want two . ''
4.5793	There was a smile on Cameron 's face that attracted Herbert 's attention .
7.4392	`` Is it yours ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
3.1934	`` No ; I know who owns it , though . ''
3.9880	`` It is n't the landlord , is it ? ''
8.4583	`` No . ''
2.9376	`` Then I ca n't imagine whose it is , '' said Herbert .
7.8993	`` Ca n't you ? ''
14.0961	`` No , '' said Herbert .
7.9499	`` Will you tell me ? ''
7.0146	`` It is yours ! ''
9.9167	`` Mine ! ''
386.5473	exclaimed our hero , in the utmost surprise , `` Yes ; I intended at first not to give it to you till I went away ; but I may as well give it now , on one condition -- that you let me use it whenever I please . ''
8.5852	`` How kind you are ! ''
19.4751	said Herbert , gratefully .
10.7170	`` I never received such a splendid present in my life .
6.3242	I have done nothing to deserve it . ''
6.0958	`` Let me be the judge of that .
6.5968	Now , with your consent , we will try her . ''
10.0384	With the utmost alacrity Herbert followed Cameron aboard the new craft , and took the oars .
1.6347	Smoothly and easily the boat glided off on the surface of the pond .
6.2496	`` I like it much better than James ' , '' said Herbert .
7.6017	`` It 's a better model .
10.0254	His is rather clumsy .
1.3049	Besides , this is new and he must have had his for some time . ''
19.4272	`` He has had it three years . ''
8.3980	`` It needs painting . ''
0.1801	`` Even if it were painted it would n't come up to this . ''
10.6142	`` I agree with you , '' said Cameron .
6.9790	`` I am afraid James will be stirred with envy when he sees your boat . ''
7.5563	`` I am afraid so , too .
6.6680	He wo n't believe it is mine . ''
51.4087	`` It may be your duty , out of a delicate regard to his feelings , to give it up , or exchange , '' suggested Cameron .
18.7711	`` That 's a little further than I carry my delicate regard to his feelings , '' responded Herbert .
37.4730	After half an hour 's rowing , Cameron said , suddenly : `` I must go back to the hotel .
25.9663	I came near forgetting an important letter , which must be sent off by this afternoon 's mail . ''
23.3199	Herbert was a little disappointed , still he said , cheerfully : `` All right , Mr. Cameron . ''
3.0753	`` Do n't you cease your rowing , '' said the collegian .
3.0286	`` I thought you might not like to walk back alone . ''
7.7935	`` I do n't mind that .
5.2995	I shall hurry back , and should be poor company .
16.6896	We will meet to-morrow morning . ''
14.4177	Cameron set out on his return home .
1.1161	He had gone less than quarter of a mile when he met James Leech .
42.7687	`` Good afternoon , Mr. Cameron , '' said James , who was always polite to the rich manufacturer 's son .
17.1629	`` Good afternoon , James . ''
2.6052	`` Wo n't you go out in my boat , Mr. Cameron ? ''
3.6950	`` Thank you , I have just returned from the pond .
0.2105	I am obliged to go back to the hotel to write a letter . ''
4.3874	`` I should have been glad of your company . ''
5.1473	`` You wo n't be alone , '' said Cameron , mischievously .
15.2630	`` I left Herbert Carter at the pond . ''
6.0501	`` Was he out in the boat ? ''
19.6017	asked James , hastily .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
17.3077	Without a word James walked abruptly away .
15.6777	He was very angry with Herbert , who , he naturally concluded , was out in his boat .
1.6435	`` He 's the most impudent and cheeky boy I ever met ! ''
8.2192	he said to himself .
51.2877	`` Last evening , I positively forbade his getting into my boat and he do n't take the slightest notice of it .
5.0688	He need n't think he can take such liberties . ''
8.1119	Cameron smiled , as he read James ' feelings in his face .
26.9803	Just before reaching the pond there was rising ground , from which James could take a general survey of the lake .
14.9145	Herbert was cruising about and had not yet seen James .
3.3792	`` He do n't think I 'm so near , '' thought James .
4.1760	`` He thinks I wo n't know anything about his impudence .
5.0441	I 'll soon make him draw in his horns . ''
8.0569	In his excitement , James did not notice the boat particularly .
1.3861	If he had he would have seen that it was not his boat .
2.9415	But , so far as he knew , there was no other boat on the pond .
209.9702	Indeed , there was no boy whose father could afford to buy him one , and James had come to think himself sole proprietor of the pond , as well as of the only craft that plied on its surface .
94.7724	`` I wonder , '' he thought , `` whether I could n't have Herbert fined for taking my property without leave , especially after I have expressly forbidden him to do it .
26.2260	I must ask my father this evening .
1.5052	It would bring down his pride a little to be taken before a justice . ''
24.7753	Herbert had got tired of cruising , and made a vigorous stroke , as if to cross the pond .
74.2188	James put up his hand to his mouth and shouted at the top of his voice : `` Come right back , Herbert Carter ! ''
116.1897	Herbert , bending over his oars , heard the peremptory order of James to come back and smiled to himself as he instantly comprehended the mistake which the latter had made .
52.1180	From James ' standpoint his own boat was not visible and it was not surprising that he should suspect our hero of having appropriated his boat .
4.4405	`` I wo n't undeceive him , '' he thought .
7.8145	`` What do you want ? ''
3.1504	he asked , resting on his oars , and looking back at James .
5.0797	`` You know what I want , '' said James , provoked .
8.7182	`` How should I know ? ''
5.2161	`` I want you to come right back , at once . ''
9.5325	`` What 's happened ?
8.5222	What am I wanted for ? ''
5.5647	`` You 'll be wanted by the constable . ''
0.4211	`` I do n't understand you , '' said Herbert , shrugging his shoulders .
6.0754	`` You appear to be mad about something . ''
1.1668	`` So I am , and I have a right to be . ''
2.6311	`` Well , I 'm sure I have no objection , if you like it . ''
19.5514	James was pale with rage .
4.0712	`` Bring that boat right back here , '' he said .
22.7348	`` If you 'll give me a good reason , perhaps I will ; but I do n't think it necessary to obey you without . ''
7.1459	`` You are a thief . ''
27.3694	`` Say that again , '' said Herbert , sternly , `` and I will come ashore and give you a whipping . ''
6.3157	`` You ca n't do it . ''
7.8999	`` I can try . ''
6.4825	`` Do n't you know I can have you arrested for stealing my boat , you loafer ? ''
4.1154	`` Who 's been stealing your boat , you loafer ? ''
7.9104	`` You have . ''
7.0944	`` Are you sure of it ? ''
4.9945	`` Why , you are in my boat this very minute . ''
5.0573	`` I think you are mistaken , '' said Herbert , quietly .
2.3568	`` Do n't you call that a boat you are in ? ''
26.4175	`` Yes , I do ; but there 's more than one boat in the world , and this is n't your boat . ''
36.4572	He rowed near the shore as he spoke , and James , his attention drawn to the boat , saw that it was n't his .
25.4435	At the same time , walking nearer the edge of the pond , he caught sight of his own boat moored at its usual place .
7.6799	`` I guess I made a mistake , '' said James .
6.7576	`` I think you have , '' returned Herbert , quietly .
7.6289	`` Where did that boat come from ? ''
20.7468	demanded James .
7.2695	`` I do n't know . ''
8.6259	`` You do n't ?
6.6492	Then you 've taken it without leave . ''
20.4212	`` Oh , the owner wo n't object to my using it , '' said Herbert , with a queer smile .
8.4940	`` How do you know ? ''
5.5412	`` He 's an intimate friend of mine . ''
8.8103	`` The owner ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
7.1954	`` I suppose it belongs to Mr. Cameron , then ? ''
7.6991	`` He bought it . ''
7.4751	`` Do you call him your intimate friend ?
6.6785	He 'd be proud if he heard it , '' said James , with a sneer .
8.0956	`` Would he ? ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
0.1953	`` I should think he would , considering your high position in society . ''
12.1286	`` I think he 's a pretty good friend of mine but I have never called him an intimate friend . ''
7.1310	`` Yes , you have .
0.1967	You said the owner of that boat was an intimate friend of yours . ''
8.6707	`` So he is .
6.6921	I 'm with him all the time . ''
4.8893	`` Then why do you deny that you called Mr. Cameron your intimate friend ? ''
9.9234	`` Because Mr. Cameron does n't own the boat . ''
10.3605	`` Just now you said he bought it . ''
2.2669	`` So he did , but he does n't own it . ''
7.8671	`` Then who does ? ''
5.7954	`` I do , '' was the unexpected reply .
4.9992	`` You -- own -- that -- boat ? ''
21.5796	ejaculated James .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
11.4569	`` Did Mr. Cameron give it to you ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
7.4423	`` I do n't believe it .
21.3049	That boat must have cost sixty or seventy dollars .
0.3272	I do n't believe he would give you such a present as that . ''
3.6517	`` I do n't know as it makes much difference . ''
5.2243	`` When did he give it to you ? ''
25.9553	`` This afternoon .
10.0591	I 'll row in .
6.7292	Perhaps you would like to examine it . ''
217.5895	James surveyed with envious eyes the neat , graceful boat , for he saw at a glance that his own boat , even when new , was by no means its equal .
7.5140	`` Is n't it a beauty ? ''
17.5160	asked Herbert , not without pride .
12.3897	`` Very fair , '' answered James , condescendingly .
5.4247	`` Did you ask Mr. Cameron to give it to you ? ''
3.3010	`` I never ask for gifts , '' said Herbert , with emphasis .
3.6232	`` What makes you ask such a question as that ? ''
6.0274	`` I thought it queer that he should have given you such a handsome present . ''
5.8332	`` It was certainly very generous in him , '' said Herbert .
0.1969	`` I should n't think you 'd want to accept it , though . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
2.9256	`` Because you are a poor boy and it do n't correspond with your position . ''
3.6301	`` Perhaps not ; but that do n't trouble me . ''
4.1303	`` A less expensive boat would have been more appropriate . ''
3.9185	`` Perhaps it would ; but you would n't have me refuse it on that account ? ''
60.1505	James did not answer and Herbert asked : `` Are you going out in your boat this afternoon ? ''
7.5405	`` I should like to try yours , '' said James .
0.3735	`` I shall be glad to have you , '' said Herbert , politely .
0.5650	`` And you may take mine , '' said James , with unwonted politeness .
8.7131	`` All right . ''
9.4511	The two boys got into the boats and pulled out .
15.3403	James was charmed with the new boat .
3.1136	In every way it was superior to his own boat , apart from its being newer .
437.3674	It was certainly very provoking to think that a boy like Herbert Carter , poor almost to beggary , should own such a beautiful little boat , while he , a rich man 's son , had to put up with an inferior one .
39.1979	`` I say , Herbert , '' he began , when they returned , `` do n't you want to exchange your boat for mine ? ''
1.3377	`` Not much ; I should be a fool to do that . ''
0.2032	`` I do n't mean even , for I know your boat is better .
15.6894	I 'll give you five dollars to boot . ''
42.6900	`` No , thank you ; there 's a good deal more than five dollars ' difference between your boat and mine . ''
91.5131	`` Five dollars would come handy to a poor boy like you , '' said James , in his usual tone of insolent condescension .
4.0161	`` I do n't want it enough to exchange boats . ''
4.4272	`` Well , I 'll give you ten dollars , '' said James .
6.2769	`` That 's an offer worth thinking about . ''
5.9694	`` I sha n't need to think about it .
8.2192	I say no . ''
4.7871	`` You 've got an extravagant idea of your boat .
1.5086	Mine is nearly as good but I 've taken a fancy to yours .
9.0347	How will you trade , anyway ? ''
3.9084	`` I do n't feel at liberty to trade at all .
16.6408	Mr. Cameron gave me the boat , but he is to have the use of it while he is here .
4.7127	He would n't be willing to have me exchange . ''
2.6030	`` He can have the use of it all the same if it is mine . ''
4.8002	`` It wo n't do , James , '' said Herbert , shaking his head .
3.2403	`` You are very foolish , then , '' said James , disappointed .
2.8863	`` I may be , but that is my answer . ''
20.9600	James walked away .
56.7670	He made up his mind , since he could not have Herbert 's boat , to tease his father to buy him a new one .
0.4046	As to rowing in an inferior one , his pride would not permit it .
7.6628	James broached the subject which was uppermost in his mind as soon as he got home .
4.2979	`` I wish you 'd buy me a new boat , father , '' he said .
5.6878	`` What 's the matter with the boat you have now ? ''
7.4942	`` I do n't want to be outdone by Herbert Carter . ''
4.3914	`` I do n't see how that can be . ''
5.2639	`` He 's got a beautiful new boat , twice as handsome as mine ever was . ''
7.9104	`` He has ! ''
9.2778	exclaimed the squire , in amazement .
5.1997	`` How can he have , without any money ? ''
11.0923	`` Mr. Cameron gave it to him . ''
7.4423	`` I do n't believe it .
8.9852	Probably the boat belongs to Mr. Cameron and he has only let Herbert use it . ''
9.2887	`` No , Mr. Cameron gave it to him .
16.9224	Herbert told me . ''
5.6463	`` Perhaps he has not told the truth . ''
92.1248	`` He would n't tell a lie -- that is , about that , '' said James , modifying his first assertion lest it might be a compliment .
10.2386	In reality he had implicit confidence in Herbert 's word .
166.8640	`` You would n't want me to be rowing around in a poor boat , while that beggar has a new one , '' said James , artfully appealing to his father 's pride .
94.3082	`` Well , the fact is , my son , '' said the squire , rather embarrassed , `` it would not be convenient for me to buy you a new boat just now . ''
9.9040	`` Why not , father ?
6.8301	I thought you had plenty of money . ''
4.4142	`` So I have ; but I have made some investments under the advice of Mr. Temple .
9.5506	If you can arrange to exchange boats by paying a little to boot , you may do so . ''
0.3422	`` I have proposed it , but Herbert is very stiff about it . ''
10.5144	`` Humph ! ''
8.0931	said the squire , clearing his throat ; `` I think you will have to wait a while . ''
10.3441	`` How long ? ''
19.7924	asked James , dissatisfied .
203.2644	`` I 'll tell you what I 'll do , '' said his father , `` If things go well , I expect to make a good deal of money within twelve months .
4.6395	Instead of a rowboat , I 'll buy you a beautiful little sailboat next season . ''
8.2073	`` Will you ? ''
20.4964	exclaimed James , delighted .
4.9590	`` Yes ; wo n't that be much better ? ''
6.8603	`` You are right , father . ''
31.3558	Certainly a sailboat would be far better and there was very little chance of Herbert 's having one given him .
70.4197	So James went cut rowing contentedly the next afternoon , although Herbert was out also in the new boat .
8.6423	`` Your boat is better than mine , '' said James .
5.5811	`` However , I am to have an elegant yacht next year . ''
8.1541	`` Are you ? ''
18.9034	said Herbert , interested .
12.5775	`` Father has promised to get me one .
187.8123	He would get me one this season but it would be some time before it could be got ready and I can have it the first thing next spring . ''
12.3868	`` I congratulate you , '' said Herbert .
6.4611	`` I should like a sailboat myself . ''
53.9823	`` I dare say you would , '' said James , pompously , `` but of course you can not expect to have one . ''
41.2394	`` I do n't think there is much chance myself , unless somebody leaves me a fortune , '' said Herbert , good-naturedly .
6.4244	`` I am satisfied with this boat . ''
1.7757	`` Of course it is more than a boy in your circumstances could expect . ''
21.1616	Herbert smiled .
5.9794	He was used to references to his circumstances .
5.7416	James never allowed him to forget that he was a poor boy .
9.7849	He thought it hardly worth noticing .
6.6677	`` Shall we have a race ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
10.5450	`` Just as you say , '' said James .
10.7464	James thought himself the better rower or he would not have consented to row across the pond .
8.6133	`` Are you ready ? ''
20.4206	asked Herbert .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
7.6938	`` Give way , then . ''
6.1565	Both bent to their oars and rowed their best .
0.4380	But it was not long before Herbert began to draw away from his antagonist .
66.7521	He had not had as much practice as James , but he was stronger in the arms , and had paid more attention to Cameron 's instructions .
5.9471	He came in more than a dozen lengths ahead of his competitor .
4.8275	`` I 've won the race , James , '' he said , with a smile .
3.0586	`` You ought to , '' said James , in a surly tone .
3.5481	`` I have n't had as much practice as you . ''
8.2884	`` What if you have n't ?
0.2202	You 've got a new boat , while mine is old and clumsy . ''
6.6037	`` If you think that makes any difference I 'll row back with you , changing boats . ''
15.8194	`` Agreed , '' said James .
7.4222	But James brought up the rear at about the same distance .
6.6284	`` Beaten again , '' said Herbert , pleased with his success .
3.0467	`` There 's nothing to crow about , '' said James , crossly .
2.3746	`` Your boat is a good one but I 'm not used to it . ''
4.8940	`` I am not much used to it myself .
12.2155	I only rowed in it yesterday for the first time . ''
4.0159	`` That 's long enough to get the hang of it .
8.2123	There is n't much fun in rowing .
7.3317	I 'd a good deal rather sail . ''
8.6284	`` I like both .
7.6591	There 's more exercise in rowing . ''
4.9728	`` Do n't you get exercise enough in hoeing potatoes ? ''
24.7674	asked James , with a sneer .
3.0681	`` I should n't think laborers would need any extra exercise . ''
5.7192	`` There 's some advantage in varying your exercise .
7.2678	There is n't much fun in hoeing . ''
5.7700	`` No , I should think not . ''
7.8818	`` Are you going in ? ''
9.3933	asked Herbert , noticing that James was proceeding to fasten his boat .
3.2965	`` Yes , I 've got tired of the water . ''
18.8569	Herbert was not to be alone , however , for just then Mr. Cameron appeared on the bank .
1.2640	`` I think I 'll go out with you , '' he said .
12.6889	`` All right , '' said Herbert , with alacrity , as he rowed the boat to shore .
82.9168	`` Mr. Cameron , '' said our hero , `` mother has asked me to invite you to take tea with us this evening . ''
6.0049	`` I shall be very glad to come , '' said Cameron .
43.4435	`` We live in humble style , you know , '' said Herbert , `` but I told mother you would n't mind that . ''
8.6064	`` Thank you for saying so .
44.8351	I shall be very glad to meet your mother , and expect to enjoy myself better than at Squire Leech 's table .
4.9623	It is n't the style , but the company .
17.9614	Why is James going away so soon ? ''
7.6723	`` I have beaten him in two races , '' said Herbert .
4.9774	`` I am not surprised to hear of your success .
8.0980	You are really gaining very fast . ''
7.5098	`` I am glad of it .
6.6390	I want to be a good rower . ''
12.9187	`` It is a good thing to do well anything you undertake , whether it be rowing or anything else . ''
5.7342	`` James thinks I do n't need to row for exercise . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
21.6973	`` He thinks I shall get enough exercise in hoeing potatoes , '' answered Herbert , with a smile .
3.0758	`` It would n't do him any harm to get exercise in the same way . ''
6.5073	`` The very idea would shock him . ''
1.0633	At five o'clock Mr. Cameron knocked at the door of Mrs. Carter 's cottage .
14.2713	It was opened by Herbert himself .
4.9811	`` Walk in , Mr. Cameron , '' he said , cordially .
5.3671	`` My mother is in the next room . ''
28.1071	Mrs. Carter was prepossessed in favor of Cameron .
68.8240	In worldly advantages he was her superior ; yet with the instinct of a gentleman he seemed unconscious of any such difference and did not exhibit the least trace of condescension , as many ill-bred persons might have .
0.3301	`` I have wanted to see you , Mrs. Carter , '' he said .
0.1880	`` As the mother of my professor , the desire was only natural . ''
8.3073	`` Herbert tells me he has learned a good deal since he has been reading to you .
2.6437	He has often spoken of his good fortune in meeting you . ''
7.5145	`` I feel equally fortunate in meeting him .
5.0494	Not every boy of his age would adapt himself as readily and intelligently as he has . ''
26.5512	`` I am very glad if you find Herbert of service to you , '' said Mrs. Carter .
1.2444	`` In all ways the engagement has been of advantage to him . ''
70.6254	`` Squire Leech was kind enough to offer me the services of his son , James , '' said Cameron , smiling .
330.3002	`` James would hardly have been willing to sacrifice so much of his time , '' said Herbert , `` though he might be willing to try it for a day or two to supersede me . ''
185.2561	`` I think I shall have to worry along with my present professor , '' said Cameron , `` and allow James to devote his superior talents to some other business . ''
119.9894	The table was already spread in honor of the guest , and both Herbert and Mrs. Carter were gratified to find that the young collegian did ample justice to the meal .
110.8405	`` I feel almost ashamed of my appetite , '' said Cameron ; `` but the change from the stereotyped bill of fare at the hotel is pleasant and gives the food an increased relish . ''
51.8470	`` I am glad to hear you say so , Mr. Cameron ; I could hardly expect to compete with the hotel in point of variety .
5.9372	Let me give you another cup of tea . ''
9.6123	`` Thank you .
20.0628	I do n't often venture on a third cup , but I think I will make an exception to-night . ''
11.8968	`` Dr. Johnson sometimes got up to a dozen , I believe , '' said Herbert .
170.2808	`` He exceeded that number at times ; but we must remember that the cups in his day barely contained a third as much as ours , so he was not so immoderate , after all .
7.8270	His excesses in eating were less pardonable . ''
7.3901	`` Was he a very large eater ? ''
10.4360	asked the widow .
38.5477	`` He actually gorged himself , if we are to believe the accounts that have come down to us , '' said Cameron .
12.3791	`` I am afraid , Mrs. Carter , you would have found him a very unprofitable boarder . ''
53.7000	`` But , '' said Herbert ; `` there is one of Dr. Johnson 's labors I shall not seek to imitate .
6.0739	I shall never attempt to write a dictionary . ''
6.3600	`` It must be a monotonous and wearisome labor .
14.0233	Besides , I do n't think we could either of us improve upon Webster or Worcester . ''
28.2621	They arose , and Mrs. Carter , who could not afford to keep a servant , herself cleared away the tea table .
39.6397	`` Herbert , '' said the young collegian , `` you mentioned one day that your father was an inventor . ''
11.8161	`` He made one invention , but whether it will amount to anything , I do n't know .
7.6823	He had high hopes of it , but died before he had any opportunity of testing its value . ''
5.9178	`` Will you show it to me ? ''
9.4765	`` With pleasure . ''
190.4978	Herbert led Cameron upstairs into his own chamber , where , since his father 's death , the work which had cost his father so many toilsome hours had been kept .
19.6074	Cameron examined it carefully .
18.3466	Herbert waited anxiously for his verdict .
9.7641	At length he spoke .
18.2518	`` As far as I am qualified to judge , '' he said , `` your father 's invention seems to embody an improvement .
5.4396	But you must not rely too much upon my opinion .
6.2629	My knowledge of the details of manufacturing is superficial .
4.4541	I should like to show it to my father . ''
49.6889	`` There is nothing that I would like better , '' said Herbert , `` if you think he would be willing to examine it . ''
6.7407	`` He would be glad to do so .
3.5866	It is for his interest to examine anything which will facilitate the details of his business .
68.2575	I am intending to go home next Friday afternoon , and , with your permission , will carry this with me . ''
7.2770	`` I shall feel very much obliged to you if you will , '' said Herbert .
8.5567	`` It may be worth nothing .
34.9994	I know it would have been my father 's wish to have it examined by one who is qualified to judge . ''
16.7087	`` It is a pity your father could not have lived to enjoy the benefit of his invention , if it succeeds . ''
4.8071	`` He was a great loss to us , '' said Herbert .
74.2896	`` There were but three of us , and he was at an age when we might hope to have him with us for a good many years yet .
68.6024	If I had been a few years older , I should have been better able to make up his loss to my mother . ''
39.1978	`` She is fortunate in having a son who is so willing to do his best for her , '' said Cameron , kindly .
78.8059	`` We do n't know what the future may have in store for us , Herbert ; but you may rely upon my continued friendship . ''
67.2577	Herbert pressed the hand of the young collegian warmly , for he knew that the offer of service was no empty compliment , but made in earnest sincerity .
12.8784	The evening passed pleasantly and at nine o'clock Cameron took his leave .
13.5421	Herbert accompanied him as far as the hotel .
64.9198	He was walking leisurely back when he heard his name called and , turning , saw that it was James Leech who had accosted him .
12.5298	`` Where have you been , Carter ? ''
7.4874	inquired James ; `` been to see Mr. Cameron , I suppose ?
6.0781	Does n't he get enough of your company in the daytime ? ''
7.3069	`` You must ask him that .
0.1830	He has been taking tea at our house and I accompanied him home . ''
6.3017	`` He took supper at your house ! ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
5.6951	`` He seems very fond of keeping low company . ''
7.7246	`` What do you mean ? ''
9.1855	demanded Herbert , his eyes flashing with indignation at this insolence .
5.1220	`` I mean what I say , '' answered James , doggedly .
81.8399	`` Then I advise you hereafter to keep your impudence to yourself , '' retorted Herbert ; `` and for fear you may forget it , I give you this as a reminder . ''
35.7539	An instant later James Leech found himself lying on his back on the sidewalk with Herbert bending over him .
4.3493	He kept upon his feet , pale with rage and mortification .
2.8326	`` I 'll be revenged upon you yet , you brute ! ''
1.6981	he shrieked , in his rage leaving our hero victor of the field .
18.1407	`` I would n't have touched him if he had n't spoken against my mother , '' said Herbert .
23.2245	James Leech was furious at the humiliation .
18.1937	What he , a gentleman 's son , to be knocked down and triumphed over by a boy who was compelled to work !
10.4275	Why , it was almost a sacrilege and no punishment could be too severe for such , flagrant outrage .
10.9916	How should he be revenged ?
5.5768	First of all , he would get Herbert discharged from his present employment .
9.0226	Surely Mr. Cameron would not continue to avail himself of the services of a common bully .
1.3756	To attain this , he decided to reveal the matter to his father .
6.3921	`` That boy actually knocked you down ! ''
11.0527	exclaimed the squire .
6.7822	`` But why did you permit him ? ''
9.3343	`` He took me by surprise , '' said James .
6.9266	`` And what did you do ?
10.3760	Did you knock him over ? ''
8.4458	`` I would , '' said James , `` but I did n't care to pursue him .
8.1860	I thought I would wait and tell you . ''
4.3530	`` And what do you want me to do ? ''
12.0448	`` To get Mr. Cameron to turn him off .
7.2593	I want him to starve , '' said James , bitterly .
21.6987	`` You express yourself too strongly , James ; but , under the circumstances , I ca n't blame you much .
7.9296	The boy is evidently a ruffian . ''
54.8359	`` Yes , he is a ruffian and a brute , and I do n't see what Mr. Cameron sees about him to like , I am sure . ''
1.5693	`` Probably the boy makes him think he is a model of excellence .
7.5898	Such boys are apt to be deceitful . ''
9.2706	`` He 's deceitful enough .
4.2469	You 'd think butter would n't melt in his mouth . ''
89.9353	`` I shall make such representations to Mr. Cameron as , I flatter myself , will dispose of the case of this young rascal and make him repent his brutal and unprovoked assault .
16.9850	I 'll go over to-morrow forenoon to the hotel and speak to him on the subject , '' said the squire , pompously .
8.5583	`` Thank you , father .
6.4132	Put it as strong as you can . ''
3.0401	`` I will , you may be assured of that . ''
26.0126	`` If I can only get him turned off , I wo n't mind his hitting me , '' thought James .
6.9161	`` I hope to see him in the penitentiary some day .
7.6160	It would do him good . ''
110.9606	It so happened that Cameron had met Herbert in a walk he took before breakfast and had been informed of the occurrence of the evening previous .
151.9728	`` I do n't know whether I ought to have struck James , '' said Herbert , in conclusion ; `` but when he called my mother and myself low , I could n't help it . ''
1.6081	`` I am glad you did it , '' said the young collegian .
6.8062	`` The boy is a disagreeable cub and deserves more than one lesson of that sort .
6.8708	Did n't he offer to hit you back ? ''
8.4583	`` No . ''
9.7009	`` So I supposed .
24.8664	I do n't approve of fighting ; but if he had shown a little courage to back his insolence , I should have despised him less .
8.5628	What will he do ? ''
2.8660	`` He will injure me , if he can , '' said Herbert .
5.7909	`` We will see what comes of it .
1.4518	Meanwhile , in this matter , you may count upon my support . ''
39.8097	Herbert thanked his friend , not realizing how likely Cameron was to be called upon to redeem , his promise .
0.8296	Shortly after breakfast , Cameron was told that Squire Leech wished to see him .
13.7396	`` Good-morning , Mr. Cameron , '' said the squire .
6.6734	`` This is an early call . ''
2.9112	`` Not too early , sir , '' said the young collegian .
2.4763	`` The fact is , I have called on unpleasant business . ''
2.5748	`` Really , sir , I am sorry to hear it . ''
2.5474	`` It is about the Carter boy who is in your employ . ''
56.7448	`` By the Carter boy , you mean my young friend , Herbert Carter , I suppose , '' said Cameron , significantly .
1.3947	`` Of course if you choose to regard him as a friend . ''
8.2930	`` I certainly do . ''
420.1587	`` I do n't think you will look upon him in that light when you hear that last evening he brutally assaulted my son James , without provocation , in the village street , taking him by surprise and knocking him over . ''
9.8511	Cameron did not seem as much shocked as the squire anticipated .
9.2987	He took the revelation very coolly .
5.5208	`` You say he did this without provocation ? ''
14.6516	`` Yes , Mr. Cameron . ''
14.2614	`` Did James tell you this ? ''
2.1603	`` He did ; and he is a boy of truth . ''
23.4323	`` But perhaps he did not look upon it as a provocation when he called Herbert and his mother low . ''
5.4243	`` He did n't say anything about that . ''
8.3111	`` I dare say not . ''
19.8027	`` And even if he did use the word , it would not justify Carter in brutally assaulting him . ''
6.6806	`` I confess I do n't agree with you there , Squire Leech .
6.3954	I hate brutality as much as anyone and an unprovoked assault I certainly look upon as brutal .
124.1405	But for a boy to resent an insult directed against his mother is quite a different matter , and if Herbert had not acted as he did , I should have been ashamed of him . ''
22.0825	Squire Leech flushed all over his face .
10.0427	This certainly was plain speaking .
9.2286	`` You have probably been misled by Carter 's statement .
28.5400	I do n't believe my boy did anything , or said anything , that Carter had a right to complain of . ''
4.3944	`` From what I have observed of your son , I regret to differ with you . ''
14.5767	`` You are prejudiced against James . ''
20.9243	`` I was not to begin with ; but what I have seen of him , certainly , has not prepossessed me in his favor .
5.5113	He seems disposed to be insolent to those whom he fancies beneath him in social position . ''
102.4721	`` If you refer to the Carter boy , '' said the squire , pompously , `` I should say that James is right in regarding him as a social inferior . ''
127.8049	`` I wo n't argue that point , or consider how far the possession of money , which is certainly the only point in which Herbert is inferior , justifies your son in looking down upon him .
1.7541	I will only say that he has no right to insult his social inferiors . ''
30.6158	The discussion had assumed such a different character from what the squire anticipated , that he found it difficult to come to the request he had in view .
8.0781	But he did it .
9.3807	`` I am certainly astonished , Mr. Cameron , to find you so prejudiced against my son .
247.8628	If you should find you had done him an injustice , and that the Carter boy was really the aggressor last evening , will you be willing to discharge him from your employment ? ''
17.4446	`` If I find Herbert justifies your denunciations and his assault was unprovoked , I will discharge him . ''
11.8526	`` Then you can do it at once .
4.8857	You have my son 's word for it . ''
6.2999	`` And I have Herbert 's word for the contrary . ''
13.6733	`` Between the two , I believe James . ''
5.0148	`` Does James deny that he called Herbert and his mother low ? ''
6.4854	`` I have not asked him . ''
81.1039	`` If you will do so and bring me his assurance that he said nothing of the kind , I will examine Herbert again and try to get at the truth . ''
2.5007	`` Very well ; I will put the question to him . ''
19.5123	Squire Leech did so on his return home .
45.1612	`` I do n't know but I called him something of the kind , '' James admitted ; `` but it 's true , is n't it ? ''
0.2040	`` As to that , the boy certainly acted in a very low manner .
5.3007	But you should n't have called him so . ''
31.5207	`` I could n't help it , when I heard him boasting of Mr. Cameron 's having taken supper at his house .
17.9628	Wo n't Cameron discharge him ? ''
7.3104	`` No , '' said the squire , shortly ; `` he is infatuated about ; that boy . ''
5.9513	`` Suppose we cut both of them ? ''
13.3827	`` It wo n't do , James .
0.4312	Mr. Cameron 's father is a wealthy manufacturer -- much richer than I am .
4.8428	We must keep on good terms with him , but we need n't notice the Carter boy .
4.2026	Some day he and his mother will be in my power . ''
8.1825	`` I hope so , father .
1.4827	I want to bring him to his knees , the proud beggar ! ''
29.6408	It was a bitter pill for James to swallow , seeing his rival high in the favor of the young collegian .
44.8822	Mr. Cameron went home on Friday afternoon .
6.9091	`` I shall be back Monday night , '' he said to Herbert .
25.1214	But Monday night did not bring him .
42.9818	Herbert did n't think much of it , however , as it was easy to imagine that some engagement had delayed the young collegian .
24.7316	Tuesday morning , however , he received a letter from Cameron , which contained unexpected and unwelcome intelligence .
143.0285	It ran thus : `` MY DEAR HERBERT : When I left you , I fully expected to return on Monday , but an unexpected proposal has been made to me , which I think it expedient to accept .
44.0764	The physician whom I consulted about my eyes recommends a sea voyage as likely to benefit me , and advises me to start at once .
54.7588	A fellow student is intending to sail on Saturday next for Rio Janeiro , and I have decided to go with him .
13.4347	While I hope to reap advantage from the voyage , I regret that our pleasant intimacy should terminate so suddenly .
78.3143	I ought not to use the word ` terminate ' , however , as I fully intend to keep track of you , if I can , in your future plans .
48.7046	I may be gone some months , perhaps a year , but when I return I shall manage to meet you .
19.5395	`` I have submitted your father 's invention to my father , who will examine it when he has leisure , and communicate with you .
29.5014	There may be some delay , as he is obliged to go to Europe for three months on business .
245.3921	`` I am owing you five dollars , but inclose fifteen , which I beg you to accept , with my thanks for your services , and my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity . ''
7.4638	This was the letter which Herbert read with feelings of regret , almost bordering upon dismay .
194.5522	He missed the daily companionship of Cameron , for whom he had formed an attachment almost brotherly , and , besides , he was forced to regard the departure of his friend in its bearing upon his material interests .
32.0253	The income upon which he chiefly depended was suddenly withdrawn , and , look where he might , he could not see where he was to supply the deficiency .
97.9467	The fifteen dollars which Cameron had so considerately sent him would , indeed , last some time ; but when that was spent what was he to do ?
6.2292	This was a question which cost him anxious thought .
9.8354	It was not till the day afterward that James Leech heard of Cameron 's departure .
55.1362	It is needless to say that he took a malicious satisfaction in the thought that his enemy would now be deprived of his main income .
8.6054	He hastened to inform his father .
9.2169	`` What ?
20.2691	Cameron gone away ?
7.1655	That is unexpected , '' said the squire .
6.3071	`` Yes ; it is sudden . ''
8.1798	`` Where is he gone ? ''
8.2056	`` They told me at the hotel that he was going to sail to South America .
7.8241	His eyes are weak , you know , and the doctor thinks the voyage will do him good . ''
14.6198	`` I wonder he did n't take the Carter boy with him , he seemed infatuated with him . ''
13.5974	`` He do n't care anything about Carter .
2.7761	At any rate , he will forget all about him , now he is away .
8.5712	The beggarly upstart will have to draw in his horns now .
1.4130	He wo n't put on so many airs , I 'm thinking . ''
6.3173	`` How much did Cameron pay him for reading to him ? ''
42.6320	`` Five dollars a week . ''
9.6382	`` A perfectly preposterous price . ''
9.4991	`` So I think .
11.6436	But he wo n't get it now . ''
5.3195	`` They 'll find it hard to get along . ''
8.3633	`` Of course they will .
7.5153	They ca n't pay you interest on the mortgage now . ''
5.3396	`` I do n't see how they can . ''
0.1959	`` And you can take possession of the house , ca n't you ? ''
3.0314	`` I certainly shall if the interest is n't paid promptly . ''
19.9049	`` Perhaps Carter would sell his boat now .
7.3850	He was pretty stiff about it before . ''
5.1566	`` I would n't make him an offer . ''
10.0190	`` Why not ? ''
25.5723	`` If he succeeded in selling the boat he might be able to pay the interest , and delay my getting possession of the property . ''
12.6010	`` That is true , '' said James .
6.6297	`` I did n't think of that .
15.3722	Besides , you have promised me a sailboat next spring . ''
9.2954	`` If business is good , as I hope it may be , you shall have one .
11.8461	At present I am rather short of money . ''
14.7692	`` I thought you always had plenty of money , father , '' said James , in surprise .
12.7016	`` I have been buying stocks in the city , James , and that has tied up my money .
0.3021	However , I shall probably make a very handsome profit when I sell out .
48.1854	My friend assures me that I stand a chance of making twenty thousand dollars , '' concluded the squire , complacently .
5.6752	`` That 's a big pile of money , '' said James .
7.9288	`` Are you pretty sure of making it ? ''
6.6254	`` The chances are greatly in my favor .
2.4851	Of course , it depends on the turn of the market . ''
0.5296	`` If you succeed , will you move to New York , father ? ''
9.4689	`` Very probably . ''
8.3229	`` I hope you will .
10.1463	This village is awfully slow .
15.3730	New York is the place to see life . ''
11.4428	`` There are some kinds of life it is not profitable to see , '' said the squire , shrewdly .
27.4145	`` I do n't want to be cooped up in a little country village all my life , '' grumbled James .
7.9659	`` You wo n't be .
13.7691	Do n't trouble yourself on that score . ''
12.8793	`` It will do well enough for Carter .
8.0866	He is n't fit for anything but a country bumpkin , but it do n't suit me . ''
12.9018	`` Well , James , you must be patient , and things may turn out as you desire . ''
5.2199	At the same time Herbert was holding a consultation with his mother .
5.0973	`` My prospects are not very bright here , mother , '' he said , rather despondently .
15.9111	`` I am ready enough to work , but there is no work to be had , so far as I can see . ''
11.7660	`` You forget your garden , Herbert . ''
202.4450	`` Yes ; that will help us a little ; but I ca n't expect to clear more than twenty dollars out of it , and twenty dollars wo n't go a great way . ''
12.3700	`` It is something , Herbert . ''
2.9159	`` It is n't enough to pay our next interest bill . ''
61.0072	Mrs. Carter looked troubled , `` If I could sell the property for what it cost your father I should be tempted to do it . ''
21.0305	`` You mean for fifteen hundred dollars ? ''
13.2227	`` Yes ; that would give us seven hundred and fifty dollars over the mortgage . ''
94.0256	`` I should be in favor of selling , too , in that case ; but Squire Leech only offers eleven hundred at the outside . ''
6.8932	`` He ought to be more considerate . ''
2.7102	`` He wants to make a bargain at your expense , mother .
8.3290	That is n't all .
29.5297	He is provoked to think you have n't accepted his offer before , and , of course , that wo n't incline him to be any more liberal . ''
13.6938	`` I am afraid we shall have to part with our home , '' said the widow , with a sigh .
13.4790	`` There is one hope , mother .
27.1674	I do n't like to think of it too much , for fear it wo n't amount to anything ; but father 's invention may prove valuable .
5.3652	You know Mr. Cameron 's father has agreed to examine it . ''
48.5054	`` If we could only get two or three hundred dollars for it , it would be a great help . ''
4.1723	`` If we get anything at all we shall get more .
231.8139	I am afraid we shall have to wait , though , for Mr. Cameron writes me his father is going to Europe for a few months . ''
10.1362	`` Everything seems against us , Herbert , '' said his mother , in a despondent tone .
17.8071	But Herbert was more hopeful .
31.9896	`` If we can only manage to keep along and pay the next interest , I think we 'll be all right , mother , '' he said .
7.4353	`` I mean to try , anyway .
17.5909	If there 's any work to be had anywhere within five miles , I 'll try to obtain it .
7.6193	How much money have you got left , mother ? ''
18.3069	`` Ten dollars and a half . ''
14.0230	`` And here are fifteen that Mr. Cameron sent me .
15.0063	No chance of the poorhouse for a month , mother .
5.0537	Before that has gone by something may turn up . ''
9.3802	Harvest came , and for the time Herbert was busy .
4.4104	He could not afford to hire assistance , and was obliged to do all the work himself .
12.3671	When all was finished , and his share of the vegetables sold , he sat down to count up his profits .
23.5886	`` Well , mother , '' he asked , `` how much money do you think I have made by farming ? ''
16.7446	`` You expected to make twenty dollars . ''
42.2893	`` I have cleared twenty-one dollars and a half besides the vegetables I have brought home and stored in the cellar . ''
8.0911	`` That is doing very well , '' said Mrs. Carter .
51.6229	`` I have had to work very hard for it , '' said Herbert , thoughtfully , `` and for a good many days .
1.4797	After all , it is n't quite enough to pay our interest . ''
8.1992	`` The interest does n't come due for six weeks yet . ''
47.0134	`` That is true , mother ; but six weeks hence we shall be poorer than we are now .
26.8307	We shall have to use some of this money for current expenses , and I know of no way to replace it . ''
6.7537	`` You may earn some more . ''
2.3563	`` I do n't see any chance -- that is , here .
15.5327	There is nothing doing in Wrayburn .
8.4669	If there were any factories or workshops , I might stand a chance of getting something to do . ''
19.2173	Mrs. Carter did not reply .
2.8064	She knew that Herbert was right , and she had nothing to suggest .
28.7876	`` I have thought of something , '' said Herbert ; `` but you may not like it at first . ''
7.4882	`` What is it ? ''
8.3225	asked his mother , with interest .
17.4434	`` Would you have any objection to my going to New York and trying my fortune there ? ''
16.0517	Mrs. Carter uttered a little cry of dismay .
3.4537	`` You go to New York -- a boy of your age ! ''
10.5460	she exclaimed .
6.0475	`` I am old enough to take care of myself , '' said Herbert , sturdily .
5.4629	`` A great city is a dangerous place . ''
6.2919	`` It wo n't be dangerous for me .
23.1097	I shall be too busy -- that is , if I get work -- to fall into temptation , if that is what you mean . ''
43.0254	`` I should miss you so much , Herbert , even if I knew you were doing well , '' said his mother , pathetically .
13.9908	`` I know you would , mother ; and I should miss you , too ; but I ca n't live here always .
1.4096	If I do well in the city you can come and join me there . ''
0.9949	This was the first time Herbert broached the subject of going to New York .
255.9346	He resumed the attack the next day , and the next , and finally won his mother 's consent to go for a week , and see whether he could find anything to do .
6.7553	His mother 's consent obtained , Herbert took but a day to make his preparations .
514.4554	The next day , after an early breakfast , he started for the great city , excited with the idea of going , but hardly able to repress the tears as he saw the lonely look upon his mother 's face .
3.2513	He was her only son , and she was a widow .
1.5948	`` I must send her good news as soon as possible , '' he thought .
6.5483	`` That will cheer her up . ''
29.5666	About noon Herbert reached the city .
308.1065	He had formed no particular plan , except to find Cornelius Dixon , who would doubtless be able to advise him about getting a place , perhaps would have influence enough to procure him one .
22.7231	He did not know where to look for Cornelius , but concluded that his name would be in the city directory .
10.5768	He entered a small liquor store , which he happened to pass , and walked up to the counter .
2.2135	`` Good-morning , '' said he politely , addressing a young man behind the bar .
22.3641	This young man had coarse red hair , and a mottled complexion , and looked as if he patronized freely the liquors he sold .
91.0723	He turned his glance upon Herbert , who stood before him with his fresh , inquiring face , holding under his arm a small bundle of clothing tied up in a paper .
6.9411	`` Hello , yourself ! ''
10.3461	he answered .
8.7940	`` Want some bitters ? ''
12.6902	`` Thank you , '' said Herbert , innocently , `` I do n't require any medicine . ''
10.0517	`` Medicine ? ''
7.5795	repeated the other , with a frown .
4.2777	`` Do you mean to compare my drinks to medicine ? ''
13.7235	`` You said bitters , '' returned Herbert .
3.0576	`` You 're from the country , ai n't you ? ''
10.6613	asked the bartender .
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
9.4991	`` So I thought .
10.8805	You have n't cut your eyeteeth yet .
5.3794	When a gentleman takes a drink he takes his bitters .
12.7706	Now , what 'll you have ? ''
7.7441	`` Nothing , thank you . ''
6.0594	`` Oh , you need n't thank me .
5.6140	I did n't offer to give you a drink .
8.1573	What do you want , anyhow ? ''
6.8187	`` Have you got a directory ? ''
12.4741	`` No ; we do n't keep one .
7.3715	We do n't care where our customers live .
6.7701	All we want is their money . ''
26.9977	Herbert did not fancy the bartender 's tone or manner ; but felt that it would be foolish to get angry .
25.1480	So he explained : `` I have a cousin living in the city ; I thought I could find out where he lived in the directory . ''
6.5312	`` What 's your cousin 's name ? ''
24.2788	`` Cornelius Dixon . ''
9.8800	`` Never heard of him .
4.9655	He do n't buy his bitters at this shop . ''
6.2507	It was clear that no satisfaction was to be found here , and Herbert looked further .
4.6740	Finally , at a druggist 's he found a directory , and hopefully looked for the name .
8.8502	But another disappointment awaited him .
9.1879	There were several Dixons , but Cornelius was not among them .
13.9526	`` I must give him up , and see what I can do by myself , '' thought Herbert .
5.4997	`` I wish I could come across him . ''
255.6740	It seemed strange to him that one who was so prominent as Cornelius claimed to be , and who had been living for years in the city , should have been overlooked by the compilers of the directory .
19.8927	He was not discouraged , however ; he expected to encounter difficulties , and this was the first one .
2.7554	He kept on his way , attracting some attention as he walked .
13.5570	The city Arab knows a stranger by instinct .
7.5344	`` Carry your bundle , mister ? ''
10.9918	asked a ragged urchin .
8.1974	`` No ; thank you .
6.9998	I can carry it myself . ''
7.3818	`` I wo n't charge you much .
5.0131	Take you to any hotel in the city . ''
3.7650	`` I do n't think I shall go to any hotel .
8.6216	I ca n't afford it .
8.1020	Can you show me a cheap boarding house ? ''
6.7771	`` Yes , '' said the boy .
8.0443	`` What 'll you give ? ''
23.3437	`` Ten cents . ''
8.5020	`` That ai n't enough .
13.1764	It would n't keep me in cigars an hour . ''
9.0556	`` Do you smoke ? ''
19.1040	asked Herbert , surprised .
8.3633	`` In course I do .
18.9012	I 've smoked for four or five years . ''
8.7358	`` How old are you ? ''
12.0647	`` The old woman says I 'm ten .
8.3995	She ought to know . ''
3.1818	`` It is n't good for boys to smoke , '' said Herbert , gravely .
9.4972	`` Oh , bosh !
12.2658	Dry up !
9.4228	All us boys smoke . ''
2.9918	Herbert felt that his advice was not called for , and he came to business .
58.0868	`` I 'll give you fifteen cents , '' he said , `` if you 'll show me a good , cheap boarding house . ''
29.0142	`` Well , '' said the Arab , `` business is poor , and I 'll do it for once .
9.0450	Come along . ''
157.0937	Herbert concluded from the boy 's appearance that he would be more likely to know of cheap than of fashionable boarding houses ; but it did not occur to him that there was such a thing as being too cheap .
141.9579	He realized it when the boy brought him to the door of a squalid dwelling in a filthy street , and , pointing to it , complacently remarked : `` That 's the place you want -- that 's Rafferty 's . ''
17.0784	Herbert stared at it in dismay .
7.2795	Accustomed to the utmost neatness , he was appalled at the idea of lodging in such a place .
4.4502	`` Gim me them fifteen cents , mister , '' said the boy , impatiently .
6.1987	`` But I do n't like the place .
8.3942	I would n't stay here . ''
9.5877	`` It 's cheap , '' said the young Arab .
7.7163	`` Rafferty 'll give you a lodging for ten cents , meals fifteen .
9.9708	You ca n't complain of that , now . ''
6.3860	`` I do n't complain of the price .
9.9321	It 's dirty .
4.9559	I would n't stay in such a dirty place . ''
2.1255	`` Oh , you 're a fine gentleman , you are ! ''
9.4763	said the boy , sarcastically .
0.6058	`` You 'd better go to the Fifth Avenoo Hotel , you had . ''
8.4516	`` I wo n't stop here .
8.3233	I want some decent place . ''
11.7702	Meanwhile , Mrs. Rafferty herself had come to the door , and caught the meaning of the conference .
12.7629	She took instant umbrage at Herbert 's last words .
9.8207	`` Dacent , do ye say ? ''
6.8254	she repeated , with flaming eyes and arms akimbo .
8.4825	`` Who dares to say that Bridget Rafferty does n't keep a dacent house ? ''
4.4634	`` He does , '' said the Arab , indicating Herbert , with a grin .
2.0993	`` And who are you , I 'd like to know ? ''
24.2244	demanded Mrs. Rafferty , turning upon Herbert angrily .
27.8776	`` Who are you , that talks agin ' a poor widder that 's tryin ' to earn an honest living ? ''
21.9673	`` I beg your pardon , madam , '' said Herbert , anxious to get out of the scrape .
7.5593	`` I meant no offense . ''
9.4189	`` Lucky for you , thin ! ''
14.3800	said Mrs. Rafferty , in a belligerent tone .
2.7779	`` Be off wid you both , thin , or I 'll call a cop . ''
2.9720	Herbert turned to go , nothing loath , but his guide followed him .
12.1386	`` Gim me them fifteen cents , '' he demanded .
3.8177	`` You have n't shown me a good boarding place . ''
6.4864	`` Yes , I did . ''
4.4943	`` You do n't seem to know what I want .
3.4896	I 'll give you five cents , and look out for myself . ''
13.2658	The young Arab tried for ten ; but Herbert was firm .
6.2951	He felt that he had no money to waste , and that he had selected a poor guide .
7.8110	It was wiser to rely upon himself .
201.1022	Not knowing his way , but wandering wherever the fancy seized him , Herbert finally came to Washington Square , and took a seat on one of the benches provided for the public .
14.2144	He looked around him with interest , surveying the groups that passed him , though without the expectation of recognizing anyone .
8.4919	But , as good fortune would have it , the very person he most desired to see strolled by .
22.8387	Mr. Cornelius Dixon looked like a cheap swell .
12.1234	In his dress he caricatured the fashion , and exhibited a sort of pretentious gentility which betrayed his innate vulgarity .
131.4512	He stared in wonder when a boy with a bundle under his arm started from his seat , and hurried toward him with the greeting : `` How do you do , Mr. Dixon ? ''
2.8078	`` Really , '' drawled Cornelius , `` you have the advantage of me . ''
7.8206	`` Do n't you remember me ?
16.2777	I am your cousin , Herbert Carter . ''
9.2169	`` What !
4.6956	the boy the old fellow left his old clothes to ? ''
20.4206	asked Cornelius .
13.0614	`` The same one , '' answered Herbert , smiling .
1.1344	`` You have n't got any of 'em on , have you ? ''
15.0442	asked Mr. Dixon , surveying him with curiosity .
1.3192	`` Yes ; this coat was made from my uncle 's cloak . ''
7.8743	`` Should n't have thought it .
6.8258	It looks quite respectable , ` pon my honor .
6.8392	When did you come to the city ? ''
22.8115	`` Only this morning . ''
8.4781	`` On a visit ? ''
4.0382	`` No ; I want to find a place . ''
10.5144	`` Humph ! ''
21.0579	muttered Cornelius , thoughtfully .
7.1859	`` Places do n't grow on every bush .
8.4865	Where are you hanging out ? ''
6.4102	`` I have n't found a place yet .
6.3700	I want to find a cheap boarding house . ''
6.9939	`` You might come to mine . ''
1014.1686	`` Perhaps you pay more than I could afford , '' suggested Herbert , who was not aware that Cornelius had a very limited income , and occupied a room on the fourth floor of a Bleecker Street boarding house , at the weekly expense of five dollars .
52.4518	`` You can come into my room for a day or two , and then we 'll see what arrangement we can make .
17.0311	I 'm going there now .
8.6440	Will you come along ? ''
19.6831	Herbert gladly accepted the invitation .
45.9295	He was tired of wandering about the great city , not knowing where to lay his head ; accordingly he joined his genteel cousin , and they walked toward Bleecker Street .
6.6501	`` Have you got any money ? ''
20.5011	queried Cornelius , cautiously .
10.3616	`` Not much .
28.4149	If I do n't find something to do in a week , I must go back to the country . ''
10.3872	`` A week 's a short time to find a place .
9.0617	But hold on !
7.4628	We want a boy in our store .
6.3968	I guess I could get you in . ''
7.8999	`` What wages would I get ? ''
21.3151	`` Two dollars a week , to begin with . ''
3.6326	`` I could n't live on that , could I ? ''
9.3015	`` I guess not .
1.0991	Four dollars a week would be the least you could get boarded for . ''
14.2721	`` Then it will be better for me to go home than to stay here , and get into debt . ''
31.0859	`` Perhaps it would , '' said Cornelius , who was afraid Herbert might want to borrow of him .
7.9427	`` Ca n't I get something better ?
9.7938	How much do you get ? ''
11.8014	`` Ahem !
31.5158	only twenty dollars a week , '' answered Mr. Dixon , who really got about half that .
7.4135	`` Why , that 's splendid ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
0.4264	`` So it would be if I only got it , '' thought Cornelius .
4.6413	`` I ca n't save anything , '' he answered .
8.4821	`` I have to dress in the fashion , you know , on account of my position in society . ''
72.8280	Herbert privately thought , from an inspection of his cousin 's wardrobe , that the fashion was a queer one , but he did not say so .
38.9060	`` It 's a shame the old man did n't leave us more , '' said Mr. Dixon , in an aggrieved tone .
8.5888	`` It would have been convenient , '' Herbert admitted .
9.8217	`` He ought to have left us ten thousand dollars apiece . ''
4.5398	`` What would you have done with so much money ? ''
7.2267	`` Gone into business on my own account .
2.8688	If I had a store of my own I might have offered you a place . ''
12.5792	`` But suppose I had ten thousand dollars , too ? ''
5.4981	`` Then I would have taken you into partnership .
19.3023	It would be a grand thing for you to be junior partner in a New York firm . ''
124.7555	Herbert thought so , too , though it is doubtful whether a firm of which Mr. Dixon was the head would have occupied so proud a position as some others .
4.4918	`` I suppose you have spent all your legacy ? ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
8.6494	`` I should say so .
23.8904	What 's a hundred dollars ?
48.9213	I bought a new suit of clothes , a dozen pair of kids , and a box of cigars , and that took up about all of it .
6.0946	You do n't smoke , do you ? ''
2.4864	`` Oh , no , '' answered Herbert , surprised at the question .
10.3382	`` Better not .
9.7465	It 's expensive .
28.6276	Wait a minute .
7.5210	I want to buy a cigar . ''
4.9735	Mr. Dixon dove into a cigar store , and emerged with one in his mouth .
9.0960	Soon they reached the boarding house .
6.3053	It was a five-story brick building , rather shabby outwardly .
5.7543	Cornelius opened the door with a night key , and bade Herbert follow .
143.7389	So he did , up to the fifth floor , where his guide opened a door and admitted him into a room about ten feet square , in a bad state of disorder .
3.3669	In the corner was a bed , not very inviting in appearance .
3.8172	It looked very different from the neat little bed which Herbert slept in at home .
5.4459	The furniture was of hair , and had evidently seen better days .
8.5553	There were two chairs , both of them covered with portions of Mr. Dixon 's wardrobe .
13.9674	Cornelius cleared off one , and invited Herbert to be seated .
4.7871	`` This is my den , '' he said .
9.8577	`` Den , '' seemed to be the right word , though Herbert did not say so .
0.2524	He wondered why a man with so large an income did not live better .
0.4204	`` You can brush your hair if you want to , '' said Cornelius .
8.2996	`` The supper bell will ring right off .
5.7116	I 'll take you down with me . ''
9.5911	`` Will there be room ? ''
20.4206	asked Herbert .
4.8522	`` Oh , yes ; I 'll arrange about that .
242.1162	If you like you can room with me , and I guess I can fix it so you need n't pay more than four dollars a week , getting your lunch outside . ''
153.8562	`` I wish you would , '' said Herbert , who felt that , dirty as the room was , it would be more like home to him than where he was wholly unacquainted .
8.5088	At the table below , Herbert found a seat next to Cornelius .
80.5346	There were other clerks at the table whom Mr. Dixon knew , also two or three married couples , and two extra ladies .
103.8795	`` That lady is an actress , '' whispered Cornelius , pointing to a rather faded woman , of about thirty , on the opposite side of the table .
8.1541	`` Is she ? ''
14.9618	returned Herbert , examining her with considerable curiosity .
8.4057	`` Where does she play ? ''
17.2305	`` At the Olympic , '' said Mr. Dixon .
19.1365	`` She is Rosalie Vernon . ''
6.7456	`` That 's a pretty name . ''
6.8603	`` It 's only her stage name .
14.8720	Her real name is Brown . ''
7.2963	`` Did you ever see her play ? ''
6.8085	`` Often ; she 's good . ''
8.4272	`` She looks very quiet . ''
7.3910	`` She do n't say much here ; but on the stage she has enough to say for herself .
4.2206	Do you see that man with gray hair and spectacles ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
14.2746	`` He 's an Italian count .
8.9636	He lost his property somehow , and is obliged to give lessons in French and Italian .
8.8726	Quite a come-down , is n't it ? ''
15.4872	In the evening he discussed his plans with Cornelius .
6.9347	`` Ca n't I get more than two dollars a week in a store ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
16.1785	`` I am afraid not ; though you might stumble on a place where they would give three . ''
5.0926	`` Even that would not be enough to live upon .
7.7118	I must make that , at any rate , and I hoped to be able to save something . ''
6.2705	`` There are some newsboys who make a dollar a day , '' suggested Cornelius .
24.7276	`` A dollar a day ?
27.9807	That 's six dollars a week . ''
9.7174	`` Exactly . ''
4.2853	`` Do you think I could go into that ? ''
13.0486	`` Of course you can , if you 've got money enough to buy a stock of papers to start with .
8.4852	You 'll be your own boss .
5.2922	Then there 's boot-blacking ; but that ai n't genteel . ''
7.9054	`` I should prefer selling papers . ''
7.4377	`` Then you 'd better try it .
29.0242	I 've spoken to the landlady , and she 'll take you for four dollars a week . ''
29.9920	Herbert closed the day in good spirits .
1.5936	He thought he saw his way clear to supporting himself in the city .
18.8860	Before he went to bed he wrote a cheerful letter to his mother and deposited it in a post office box at the corner .
182.7231	The next morning , by advice of his roommate , Herbert got up early , and made his way downtown and obtained a supply of morning papers .
0.8811	The first day was not a success , chiefly on account of his inexperience .
5.9985	He was `` stuck '' on nearly half his papers , and the profits were less than nothing .
16.1691	But Herbert was quick to learn .
23.2032	The second day , though he still had some papers left , he cleared twenty-five cents .
56.0917	The third day he netted seventy-five .
44.8284	He felt now that he had passed the period of experiment , and that he would at any rate , be able to pay his board .
1.7289	Of course , he hoped for something better , and indeed felt confident of it .
892.4702	Three weeks later , about eleven o'clock in the forenoon , as he stood in front of the Astor House , with his last paper in his hand , he heard his name called : `` Hello , Carter ; are you here ? ''
11.0175	He did not need to turn around to recognize James Leech .
12.0998	`` Good-morning , James , '' he said , politely .
9.6893	`` So you 're a newsboy , '' said James .
3.9159	`` Yes ; any way to make a living . ''
8.5546	`` Do you make much ? ''
9.7623	inquired his old foe , curiously .
9.9619	`` I have n't made enough to retire upon yet ; but I can manage to pay my board . ''
5.8332	`` How much do you pay for your board ? ''
8.8420	Herbert hesitated about gratifying his curiosity , but finally did so .
20.6132	`` Four dollars , '' repeated James , scornfully .
5.4175	`` It ca n't be much of a boarding house . ''
21.8525	`` An Italian count boards there , '' said Herbert , knowing James ' respect for rank .
6.9479	`` You do n't say so ! ''
19.4894	returned James , rather impressed .
5.8926	`` Did he ever speak to you ? ''
19.9469	`` He spoke to me this morning . ''
6.1761	`` What did he say ? '' ''
7.9348	` Will you pass ze butter ? ' ''
6.6547	`` Do you save up any money ? ''
21.2847	inquired James .
14.2801	Herbert penetrated his motive in asking the question , and did not mean to give too definite information .
11.8947	But James was bent on learning all he could .
18.8493	`` How much do you make a day ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
2.8430	`` Sometimes more , sometimes less , just as it happens . ''
5.4041	`` I ca n't tell anything from that . ''
7.2954	`` Why do you want to know ? ''
19.7850	asked Herbert , pointedly .
7.7896	`` Curiosity , I suppose . ''
9.4991	`` So I thought .
19.3794	If it was from interest in me , I would tell you ; but I do n't care to gratify your curiosity . ''
6.0032	`` You do n't expect me to feel any interest in a common newsboy , do you ? ''
7.4279	`` No ; I do n't .
6.1893	I know you too well for that . ''
3.2203	`` I do n't see what object you have in refusing to answer my questions . ''
5.9472	`` If you are thinking of going into the business , yourself , I 'll tell you . ''
9.1109	`` I a newsboy ?
8.4572	I sell papers in the street ?
8.7778	You must be crazy ! ''
20.0933	returned James , haughtily .
3.1703	`` I suppose you feel above it , '' said Herbert , smiling .
7.4950	`` To be sure I do .
7.2429	Have n't I a right to ? ''
4.2325	`` Oh , you must settle that question for yourself .
9.8128	Papers , sir ? ''
5.2742	The gentleman addressed purchased the last remaining paper , and Herbert was free till afternoon .
7.1313	`` How do you like the city ? ''
20.4206	asked James .
10.6486	`` Very much .
1.6243	I should like to have my mother here ; then I would be contented . ''
7.9251	`` We may come to live here , '' said James .
0.2079	`` Of course , we shall live in a brownstone front , uptown . ''
3.1998	`` I live in a brick house , '' said Herbert , smiling .
7.5300	`` Fashionable people live in brownstone fronts . ''
7.3983	`` I may be rich some time . ''
3.8217	`` Then you 'll have to go into some other business .
6.3303	But there is n't much hope for you .
7.2937	You 'll be a poor man . ''
6.4394	`` You seem very confident of it . ''
5.0653	`` You 've got no chance , you know .
7.2176	But I must be going . ''
8.0734	`` Who do you think I met this morning , father ? ''
28.0826	asked James , later in the day .
7.2695	`` I do n't know . ''
9.1990	`` The Carter boy . ''
7.4767	`` Where did you meet him ? ''
2.7315	`` He was selling papers in front of the Astor House . ''
4.1615	`` He wo n't get rich very fast in that business .
5.6086	What did he have to say for himself ? ''
2.9254	`` He would n't tell me how much money he was making .
31.0703	He pays four dollars a week for board . ''
5.8221	`` He probably finds it hard to pay that .
7.8505	It is n't likely he lays up anything .
11.1329	He would do better to stay in Wrayburn . ''
0.1894	`` Then you think he ca n't send any money to his mother ? ''
0.1987	`` No ; he will find it hard to pay his own expenses . ''
1.6386	`` Then she wo n't be able to pay the interest on the mortgage ? ''
5.3396	`` I do n't see how she can . ''
5.9789	`` And you will seize the house ? ''
6.5891	`` I fully intend to do so . ''
10.9768	`` Good !
14.7351	That 'll bring down Carter 's pride .
8.0835	He 's as cheeky as ever . ''
4.6283	`` He has n't much to be proud of . ''
3.5082	`` That do n't seem to make any difference with him .
5.5299	He talks as if he were my equal . ''
5.8848	`` That do n't make him so . ''
1.5324	`` When are you going to move to the city , father ? ''
2.5088	`` I do n't know , '' said the squire , shortly .
9.1885	`` I 've got tired of Wrayburn . ''
3.3447	`` You 'll have to stay there till my business will allow me to move . ''
15.8886	The fact was , Squire Leech had just had an unsatisfactory interview with Mr. Andrew Temple .
76.6104	Under the advice of that gentleman he had invested a very considerable sum of money in some mining shares , in the assurance that he would be able in a very short time to sell at a large profit .
3.6899	But from the time he bought , they began to drop .
15.0603	He asked an explanation of Mr. Temple .
7.6406	`` My dear sir , '' said the financier , `` there 's no being sure of the market .
5.7801	So many trivial circumstances affect it , that the wisest of us can not absolutely predict anything .
8.3963	We can only calculate probabilities . ''
5.4410	`` You told me there was no doubt about the stock rising , '' grumbled the squire .
77.0521	`` Nor is there any , if you only have patience to wait Rome was not built in a day , you know . ''
28.7344	`` It seems to me there is a good deal of uncertainty and risk in these stock operations , '' objected the squire , very sensibly .
22.5864	`` Not under discreet guidance ; if you only have pluck and patience , you are morally sure of a fortune in the end .
31.6458	Fortunes are made every day .
61.9241	Why , there 's old Jenkins , a grocer on Sixth Avenue -- you 've heard of his luck , have n't you ? ''
8.4583	`` No . ''
13.3636	`` Made fifty thousand dollars in six months from an original investment of ten thousand .
116.6094	At first , things went against him , but he was bound to see the thing through , and he did , and he 's forty thousand better off for it . ''
7.4534	`` What did he invest in ? ''
9.9221	asked the squire , eagerly .
36.1207	Mr. Temple told him , but I regret to say that the whole thing was a fiction , intended to encourage his dupe .
12.2031	He succeeded in influencing the squire to put another large sum into his hands , and sent him away hopeful .
83.8578	To raise this sum Squire Leech was obliged to sell or mortgage most of his real estate to parties whom Mr. Temple found for him .
267.1978	The prices realized were less than his valuation of the property ; but Temple told him this was not so important , as he was sure to double his money in twelve months by investments in Wall Street .
8.4619	So Squire Leech gave himself up to dreams of sudden wealth .
5.0139	He subscribed for two financial papers , and spent many hours in studying their columns .
54.8405	He was soon able to talk glibly of stocks and bonds , and the Wrayburn people thought he was on the high road to becoming a millionaire .
48.1851	`` Depend upon it , the squire 's a long-headed man , '' said old Tom Cooper , in the village tavern .
3.1254	`` It would n't surprise me a mite if he died worth a million . ''
28.9996	The weeks slipped rapidly away .
110.0104	Herbert succeeded in maintaining himself at his new business , and never failed to have ready the four dollars which he had agreed to pay for board .
15.4195	It was lucky he did , for he soon found that there would be no chance of borrowing from his roommate .
19.6766	Cornelius was always hard up .
125.2160	As he only paid a dollar more board than Herbert , the latter wondered what he did with his twenty dollars a week .
42.2060	But the fact was , Mr. Dixon at present received but half that sum , though pride induced him to represent otherwise .
32.9503	And what , I ask , are ten dollars a week to a young man of fashionable tastes ?
7.2731	No wonder he was always short of funds .
10.6285	How could it be otherwise ?
3.1980	Of course it was satisfactory to Herbert to feel that he was paying his way .
6.4371	But still he had a source of anxiety .
9.8443	He felt that he ought -- indeed , it was absolutely necessary -- to contribute to his mother 's support .
28.4277	Moreover , the dreaded day on which the semi-annual interest came due was now close at hand .
1.7575	So far as he could judge , his mother would have nothing to meet it .
5.0871	It seemed inevitable that she should submit to the squire 's demand , and sacrifice the house .
913.4616	It was a sad thing to think of , yet there was this consolation : the three or four hundred dollars cash which the squire would pay would tide over the next year or two , until Herbert was older and could earn more .
1.4482	But , after all , was it certain that he would earn more ?
46.9750	Could he sell more papers two years hence than now ?
10.0448	That was hardly likely .
1.5719	If he wanted to advance his income , it must be in some other business .
36.7524	Yet , to a boy situated as he was , there was little chance of getting any employment that would make as good immediate returns as selling papers .
14.4920	So , thinking over these things , our hero was much perplexed , and could see no way out of the difficulty .
29.5709	He had never read `` David Copperfield , '' and had not accustomed himself to expecting something to turn up .
7.7249	He was sensible enough , indeed , to know that it is idle to wait for such chances .
49.4404	Yet , when one does his duty faithfully , things will occasionally turn up , and this was precisely what happened to Herbert .
270.6345	He was standing at his accustomed post one day , when a pleasant-looking gentleman of fifty , or perhaps a little more , accosted him , inquiring for a particular morning paper .
21.4832	`` I have n't got it , sir ; but I will get you one , '' said Herbert .
8.5153	`` Will you be long ? ''
4.1828	`` No , sir ; I know where I can get one at once . ''
0.3523	`` Very well , then , I will wait here till you return . ''
14.6180	Herbert was as good as his word .
11.2399	As the gentleman paid him , he asked , pleasantly : `` How is business , my young friend ? ''
11.2003	`` Pretty good , sir . ''
6.2450	`` Can you make money enough to support yourself ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
6.6299	`` Then I suppose you are contented ? ''
2.8303	`` I should be , sir , if I had only myself to look after . ''
6.6228	`` You have n't a wife and family , I presume , '' said the gentleman , smiling .
21.0947	Herbert laughed .
3.7676	`` I hope not yet , sir , '' he answered .
2.3562	`` But I have a mother whom I ought to assist . ''
6.8952	`` And you can not ? ''
6.4807	`` I have not been able to yet .
2.7533	It takes all I can earn to pay my own expenses . ''
6.1676	`` Does your mother live in the city ? ''
23.5788	`` No , sir ; in the town of Wrayburn , fifty or sixty miles from here . ''
14.7275	`` Wrayburn ? ''
8.7858	repeated the gentleman , in surprise .
4.3521	`` Yes , sir ; it is a small village .
6.0842	I dare say you never heard of it . ''
6.2194	`` But I have heard of it .
16.2262	My son passed a few weeks there during the last summer . ''
12.9787	It was Herbert 's turn to be surprised .
3.0504	He examined the gentleman 's face attentively , and it dawned upon him who he was .
16.2753	`` Are you Mr. Cameron ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
5.7662	`` How is it that you know me ? ''
10.1954	inquired the other .
20.4122	`` My name is Herbert Carter .
6.2722	I was employed to read to your son .
8.3333	Have you heard from him ? ''
30.3774	`` We are expecting a letter daily , but the distance is considerable , and we may have to wait for some time yet .
21.8039	So you are Herbert Carter ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
6.1038	`` My son was very much interested in you .
6.6120	He has spoken often of you . ''
6.0533	`` He was very kind to me . ''
6.7238	`` Your father was an inventor . ''
1.3757	`` That was not his business , but he devoted his leisure to invention . ''
16.3405	`` My son placed in my hands , for examination , a model of his , just before he went away . ''
8.1066	`` Have you examined it ?
5.8520	What do you think of it , sir ? ''
19.6732	asked Herbert , eagerly .
0.6170	`` I only recently returned from Europe , and have not thoroughly examined it .
5.2359	So far as I have done so , I am inclined to think favorably of it . ''
17.4844	Herbert 's heart bounded with hope .
3.4821	`` Do you think we can get anything for it ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
7.9923	`` I think you can .
29.2471	Indeed , if further examination bears out my first favorable impressions , I will myself make you an offer for it . ''
2.6926	`` I should be so glad , for mother 's sake ! ''
21.2871	exclaimed Herbert .
14.7563	`` My young friend , '' said Mr. Cameron , `` I like your feeling toward your mother .
1.7633	I sincerely hope I may be able to make you a satisfactory offer .
7.7293	By the way , how are you situated ?
19.7485	Can you leave the city this afternoon ? ''
7.9296	`` Yes , sir . ''
9.5391	`` Then come home with me .
18.3766	You shall be my guest for a week .
2.5816	During that time we will examine and decide about the model . ''
6.6804	`` Thank you , sir ; you are very kind , '' said Herbert , hesitating .
8.1019	`` What makes you hesitate ? ''
3.5583	`` I am afraid I do n't look fit to visit a gentleman 's family . ''
2.9580	`` Oh , never mind that , '' said Mr. Cameron , heartily .
1.6949	`` We are plain people , and do n't value fine dress . ''
9.0271	`` Will there be time for me to go home first ? ''
7.9324	`` Yes ; you can meet me two hours hence at the St. Nicholas Hotel .
29.1695	I occupy Room 121 .
6.0675	On second thoughts , you may as well wait for me in the reading room . ''
8.5848	`` All right , sir . ''
215.9696	Herbert hurried home , arrayed himself in clean clothes , put up a small bundle of necessary articles , and in an hour and a half was at the hotel awaiting Mr. Cameron .
134.4684	He left a note for Cornelius Dixon , explaining that he was called out of the city for a few days , but would write soon .
13.5405	He did not enter into details , for he was not at all certain that things would turn out as he hoped .
0.4541	Mr. Cameron lived in a substantial country house , with a fine garden attached .
3.3697	Nothing was wanting of comfort in his hospitable home , but he avoided show and ostentation .
52.7590	To Herbert was assigned a large , well-furnished chamber , the best he had ever occupied , and he was made to feel at home .
200.7163	The next day he accompanied Mr. Cameron to the manufactory , which he found to be a scene of busy industry , employing three hundred hands .
19.6523	`` I shall be busy to-day ; but to-night I will look at your father 's model , '' said the manufacturer .
15.4889	`` Probably it will be three or four days before I can come to any decision . ''
12.2234	Herbert passed his time pleasantly for the next three or four days .
9.3073	Yet he could not avoid feeling anxious .
0.4370	Interest day was close at hand , and his hopes might end in failure .
110.1616	On the fourth day Mr. Cameron said to him : `` Well , Herbert , I have made up my mind about your father 's invention . ''
17.7480	Herbert 's suspense was great .
10.1987	His heart almost stopped beating .
11.2600	The manufacturer went on : `` I consider it practicable , and am disposed to make you an offer for it .
8.6798	Are you authorized to conclude terms ? ''
2.7816	`` My mother will agree to anything I propose , sir . ''
7.5811	`` Then this is my offer .
15.2951	The model must be patented at once .
7.8271	I will see to that .
231.3321	Then make over to me half the invention , and I will agree to pay you and your mother one thousand dollars a year for the next ten years . ''
8.4476	`` Are you in earnest ? ''
21.5696	gasped Herbert .
15.1965	`` Entirely so , '' said Mr. Cameron .
7.3349	`` Will that satisfy you ? ''
4.4961	`` I would have accepted a quarter of the sum you offer , sir . ''
3.9384	`` Better not tell me that , '' said Mr. Cameron , smiling .
6.9702	`` I might take advantage of it .
7.2365	Will you consider it a bargain , then ? ''
4.7152	`` Oh , how happy my mother will be ! ''
19.8725	said Herbert .
0.1840	`` Do n't you want to go home , and carry the news ? ''
6.8519	`` I should like to very much . ''
10.6731	Then his countenance changed .
7.6133	Two days hence , as he reflected , the interest would be payable .
7.3664	Must they lose the house , after all ?
5.1420	If only he had a small part of the money , it would make matters all right .
9.1581	`` Does anything trouble you ? ''
4.3722	asked the manufacturer , noticing the sudden change in his countenance .
49.3518	Upon this Herbert told him exactly how they were situated in regard to the house , and in what danger they were of losing it .
41.2166	`` If it 's nothing worse that that , '' said Mr. Cameron , I cheerfully , `` you need n't feel anxious .
43.5599	I will advance you ; a hundred dollars on account of the contract , and you shall give me a receipt for it . ''
3.1066	Herbert 's face cleared instantly , and he was warm in his gratitude .
40.5386	The next morning he started for home .
10.5116	After all , the little model which his father left behind , had proved to be his most valuable legacy .
10.7547	Mrs. Carter was setting the table for her solitary supper .
12.8380	She had been very lonely since Herbert went away .
29.5223	The days seemed doubly long .
6.7158	Most of all she missed him at mealtime .
88.3354	He kept her informed of all that was going on in the village , and when there was no news to tell he talked over their plans for the future .
8.0322	Life seemed very dull and monotonous without him .
32.2754	Yet the poor mother always wrote cheerfully , for she did not want to damp his courage , or interfere with the plan of life he had formed .
115.2754	She felt that there was nothing for him to do in Wrayburn , and , since she could not go to him , they must be content to live apart for the present .
44.8533	`` I wish I could see my boy , '' she sighed , as she poured out her solitary cup of tea , and tried to force down a few mouthfuls of toast .
4.6661	`` Shall we ever be able to live together again ? ''
91.3645	There was a noise at the outer door , a quick step was heard , and Herbert rushed in , nearly upsetting the table in his impetuosity , as he embraced his mother .
6.6743	`` Are you glad to see me , mother ? ''
10.1128	he asked .
1.4044	`` You do n't know how I have longed to see you ! ''
10.2449	was the heartfelt reply .
1.7537	She did not ask what brought him home , nor care to ask just yet .
7.0811	She was too happy in having him back .
13.2937	`` You do n't ask for my news , mother , '' said Herbert , after a pause .
8.4708	`` Is it good news ? ''
9.9305	she asked , wistfully .
86.2928	`` Suppose I should tell you that Mr. Cameron 's father has agreed to pay two hundred dollars for father 's model ! ''
7.8849	`` Has he , really ? ''
15.4165	asked Mrs. Carter , her face lighting up .
10.5368	`` He has bought it , that is , half of it ; but he is to pay more than that . ''
31.9430	`` More than two hundred dollars , Herbert ? ''
24.0222	`` More than three hundred .
7.1795	What do you think of that ? ''
13.7322	`` Are you in earnest , Herbert ? ''
0.2139	`` Quite in earnest , mother ; only it is better than a dream .
1.7720	You must n't be too much excited , mother , when you hear the whole .
22.1560	I will only say that we sha n't have to pinch any more , or lie awake thinking how to ward off starvation . ''
10.0467	`` And can we be together again , Herbert ?
3.9312	You do n't know how lonely it is without you . ''
10.8297	`` Poor mother !
9.0512	How lonesome it must have been !
60.4843	Yes ; we can be together again , if you think a thousand dollars a year will pay our expenses . ''
28.9128	`` A thousand dollars a year ! ''
9.8618	exclaimed Mrs. Carter , thinking that Herbert was bereft of his senses .
4.5274	`` It ca n't be that your father 's invention is worth as much as that ? ''
14.1112	`` Mr. Cameron has offered that for half the invention , and I have agreed to sell to him .
7.6488	I supposed you would not object . ''
10.7920	`` Object ?
13.4401	I did not dream of getting one-tenth as much .
6.1079	It seems to me like a dream . ''
2.6221	`` It is a happy dream , mother , and a true one .
11.1947	Father little thought what a handsome legacy he was leaving us when he left us that model . ''
1.6181	`` How happy it would have made him had he known it before he died !
7.2850	Tell me how it all happened . ''
30.3730	So Herbert had to tell his mother about his fortunate meeting with Mr. Cameron , and what resulted from it .
100.1730	`` Mr. Cameron is a very honorable man , '' he concluded , `` for he might easily have offered one-quarter as much , and I should have agreed to it .
5.5838	Now , mother , let me tell you my plans for the future .
8.3547	In the first place , are you willing to leave Wrayburn ? ''
2.9222	`` I am willing to live anywhere if we are together . ''
103.4602	`` Mr. Cameron proposed to me to accept a clerkship in his office , but for the present , I told him , I wished to make up the deficiencies in my education .
3.9992	In the town where he lives there is a flourishing academy .
13.4468	I propose that we move there , and I spend the next two years in study .
18.0142	We shall have a competent income , more than enough to support us , and so I can afford the time . ''
10.8147	`` I fully approve of your proposal , Herbert .
1.5078	We may sometime lose our money , but a good education never . ''
4.6705	`` I was sure you would agree with me . ''
0.2742	`` Shall we have any difficulty in finding a house of suitable size ? ''
8.4530	`` I inquired about that .
0.2445	There is a very pretty cottage just vacated , not far from the academy .
4.8810	I find we can have it at a moderate rent .
17.7611	I have already got the refusal of it , and will write at once that we will hire it . ''
4.8372	`` And what shall we do with this house ? ''
7.0546	`` We wo n't sell it to Squire Leech at a sacrifice .
17.6882	That is one thing certain .
6.0754	By the way , day after to-morrow is the day for paying the interest . ''
2.9960	`` Yes ; I have been troubling myself about it . ''
42.9853	`` There is no occasion ; I have a hundred dollars in my pocket , given me on account by Mr. Cameron .
10.2173	So the squire is checkmated .
1.2483	But , mother , I have a favor to ask of you . ''
10.0560	`` What is that ? ''
14.7735	`` For two days keep secret our good fortune . ''
17.1972	`` Why , Herbert ? ''
42.8079	`` I want the squire to be deceived -- to think the place is in his grasp , and realize that there is many a slip between the cup and the lip . ''
6.4467	`` What shall I say to the neighbors if they ask why you have got home ? ''
53.8700	`` Say that I am not going back to New York -- that I could n't earn enough there to save anything . ''
66.3457	`` I will do as you think best , Herbert ; but I am afraid that my joy at the good news you have brought will betray me . ''
2.5214	`` It will be attributed to your joy in having me back .
5.6728	We 'll keep things secret for a day or two -- that 's all . ''
18.6551	After supper Herbert walked out .
2.8241	He was popular in the village , and received many cordial greetings .
1.5261	To the inevitable inquiries he replied as he had suggested to his mother .
26.3904	Presently he met James Leech .
21.3185	He smiled to himself as he saw James advancing to meet him , but assumed a sober , downcast look .
15.9086	`` Hello , Carter !
9.6324	Have you got back ? ''
19.8725	said James .
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
24.7208	`` Got tired of New York ? ''
14.9683	`` I should like New York well enough , if I could make enough money there . ''
6.2773	`` Then you 're not going back ? ''
13.3574	asked James , in a tone of satisfaction .
21.3394	`` Not at present . ''
13.6671	`` I thought you 'd be coming back , '' said James , in a tone of triumph .
7.6747	`` What made you think so ? ''
4.9882	`` I knew you could n't get along there . ''
5.1777	`` I supported myself while I was there . ''
5.3320	`` But you did n't make anything over ? ''
8.4583	`` No . ''
5.7444	`` Then you might as well be back . ''
8.1615	`` I do n't know .
10.0572	I am not sure of doing that in Wrayburn . ''
8.0141	`` I do n't think I shall stay in Wrayburn long .
25.6152	Father talks of moving to New York , '' said James , in a burst of confidence .
6.1682	`` What do you expect to do here ? ''
3.5352	`` Do you think your father would give me work ? ''
20.4764	asked Herbert , demurely .
8.1615	`` I do n't know .
3.6910	He might , if you agreed to sell the house . ''
2.4784	`` We may , if we can get enough for it . ''
7.1254	`` You 'll have to , anyway .
8.2468	You must be very poor . ''
6.2442	`` We 've got a little money . ''
4.4238	`` Well , I 'll mention your case to father .
17.2049	I 'm sorry for you , but I knew beforehand you would n't succeed in New York . ''
26.7002	Herbert smiled quietly as James walked away .
0.2266	`` He 'll be astonished when he hears the truth , '' thought he .
156.6487	James repeated to his father what Herbert had told him , and the squire jumped to the conclusion that Herbert and his mother were in his power , and must accede to his demand .
23.8024	He decided to take advantage of their necessities , and allow only three hundred dollars for the house .
3.8843	He entered the little house with the air of a proprietor .
3.1937	`` I suppose you know my errand , Mrs. Carter , '' he said pompously .
5.5015	`` I believe this is interest day , '' returned the widow .
9.2169	`` Yes .
3.2807	I presume you have by this time seen the folly of holding on to the place .
1.4432	You ca n't afford it , and it is best to accept my offer . ''
11.7416	`` My mother and I have thought it over , and decided to sell , '' said Herbert .
33.8811	`` I am glad you are so sensible , '' observed Squire Leech , in a tone of satisfaction .
0.6649	`` I will give you three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage . ''
16.7794	`` You offered us fifty dollars more before . ''
16.7876	`` Then is not now .
3.5513	You should have accepted my offer when I made it . ''
0.4248	`` We have no idea of selling at that price , '' said Herbert .
15.6986	`` Our lowest price is six hundred and fifty dollars over and above the mortgage . ''
8.7656	`` Are you crazy ? ''
10.3494	ejaculated the squire , angrily .
14.1470	`` No ; we have fixed upon that as a fair price , '' said Herbert , coolly .
5.0859	`` You know you ca n't get it . ''
7.1217	`` Then we wo n't sell . ''
0.2312	`` Young man , I apprehend you do not understand how the matter stands .
7.4625	You will have to sell . ''
9.1622	`` Why must we ? ''
6.3477	`` You ca n't live on nothing . ''
8.6828	`` Of course not . ''
11.8612	`` You have made a failure in New York . ''
4.4789	`` I made my expenses while I was there . ''
8.0128	`` Then why did n't you stay ? ''
3.8121	`` I wanted to do something for mother 's support . ''
1.5399	`` You have altogether too high an idea of your own abilities . ''
7.1278	`` I hope not , sir . ''
5.2444	`` You influence your mother to her harm . ''
5.1782	`` I do n't think so , Squire Leech . ''
6.4939	`` But in this case you must yield .
3.6644	You ca n't expect me to wait for my money . ''
7.7490	`` Do you mean the interest ? ''
7.3456	`` Of course I do . ''
6.6596	`` We shall not ask you to wait .
7.0177	I am ready to pay it . ''
11.8304	The squire stared in discomfiture while Herbert drew out the precise sum needed to pay the interest .
7.1948	`` Where did you get that money ? ''
14.3432	he inquired , chop-fallen .
26.6522	`` Honestly , Squire Leech .
7.6169	Will you give me a receipt ? ''
10.2912	The squire did so mechanically .
120.7321	`` I will give you the three hundred and fifty dollars , '' he said ; `` but you must accept it to-day , or it is withdrawn . ''
41.0329	`` Neither to-day nor any other day will it be accepted , Squire Leech , '' said Herbert , firmly .
6.5864	`` If you choose to pay six hundred and fifty , we will sell . ''
6.4485	`` You must think I am crazy . ''
4.5484	`` No , sir ; it is a fair offer .
1.5472	If you do n't want to buy , we will make another offer .
21.9706	We will rent the house for ninety dollars a year .
12.0495	That is the interest on fifteen hundred dollars at six per cent .
2.9408	I believe a man in your employ wishes to live here . ''
7.1657	`` Where do you propose to live ? ''
23.7679	asked Squire Leech , in surprise .
6.0051	`` We are going to leave town . ''
4.9060	`` Have you got a chance to work outside ? ''
5.3039	`` Yes ; but I have declined to .
3.4944	I am going to school for two years -- to an academy . ''
2.6471	`` But how are you going to live all this time ? ''
9.2770	inquired the squire , in amazement .
3.0591	`` I shall live on my income , '' answered Herbert , smiling .
10.8459	`` Income !
8.3070	Have you had a legacy ? ''
8.4583	`` Yes . ''
9.2799	`` From whom ?
0.2253	I thought you only got a trunk of old clothes from your uncle . ''
6.2121	`` My legacy comes from my father . ''
7.5127	`` But he died poor . ''
86.4636	`` He left behind him an invention , half of which we have sold for an income of a thousand dollars a year . ''
25.5477	`` A thousand a year ! ''
11.1869	ejaculated the squire .
9.2169	`` Yes .
14.2973	I have sold it to the father of Mr. Cameron , who employed me last summer .
1.3087	You see , there is no occasion for our selling the house . ''
4.2087	`` You have been very fortunate , '' said Squire Leech , soberly .
7.0901	`` I congratulate you both . ''
27.7206	`` Thank you , '' said Herbert , who privately thought their visitor looked excessively annoyed at their good fortune .
5.1455	`` I will see you about the house , '' he said , as he rose to go .
61.3343	`` Well , the squire congratulated us , '' said Herbert , after he went away ; `` but he did n't look happy when he did so .
17.1728	I should n't wonder if he accepted our terms , now that he knows we need n't sell . ''
18.2028	Herbert proved to be right .
77.9009	Two days later the squire offered six hundred dollars over the mortgage for the place , and it was accepted .
17.0029	`` The place is worth more , mother , '' he said ; `` but it will relieve us from care to sell it . ''
130.7075	James was even more annoyed than his father when he heard of Herbert 's good fortune ; but after his first annoyance he showed a disposition to be friendly .
6.4776	It is the way of the world .
5.8287	Nothing makes us sought after like a little good fortune .
95.0955	James felt that , now Herbert was in a position to live without work , he was a gentleman , and to be treated accordingly .
3.1374	Herbert received his overtures politely , but rated them at their real value .
29.0581	Two years slipped away .
21.2539	Herbert has finished his course at the academy , and is about to enter the manufactory as an office clerk .
51.8752	Mr. Cameron means to promote him as he merits , and I should not be at all surprised if our young friend eventually became junior partner .
24.0196	He and his mother have bought the house into which they moved , and have done not a little to convert it into a tasteful home .
7.9325	The invention has proved all that Mr. Cameron hoped for it .
71.2963	It has been widely introduced , and Herbert realizes as much from his own half as Mr. Cameron agreed to pay for that which he purchased .
5.1041	So his father 's invention has proved to be Herbert Carter 's most valuable legacy .
25.3189	Squire Leech has been unfortunate .
4.8831	Too late he found , that Andrew Temple had deceived and defrauded him .
654.9846	All his large property , except a few thousand dollars , has been swept away , and James , disappointed in his lofty hopes , last week applied to Herbert to use his influence to obtain him a situation in Mr. Cameron 's establishment .
14.5031	There was no vacancy there , but our hero has found him a place in a dry-goods store in the same town .
5.9595	Whether he will keep it remains to be seen .
9.5992	Times have changed since James looked upon Herbert as far beneath him .
