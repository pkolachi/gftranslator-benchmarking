0.1504	Well, that's what gave me such a scare, you see.
0.1571	I've got the land, but no time to work on it.
0.1655	I wouldn't thrust myself on him, if I were you.
0.1665	Of course you know what they were, those that are missing?
0.1683	Well, what are we going to do about it, boys?
0.1685	He turned to his men and said: "The thralls have done it."
0.1691	He said he would take it only as a favor to me.
0.1694	If I wear them I shall have them made over for me.
0.1709	I thought I'd come and walk with you, he said.
0.1715	That may be; but he needn't have left us anything.
0.1738	As to that, ma'am, I have no interest in the matter.
0.1746	Jump in, my boy, and we'll take you over.
0.1758	Come, they cried, "thank him for that, farmer".
0.1768	He is pointing out our house to the man that is riding with him.
0.1772	He hadn't made it up yet, and I helped him do it.
0.1772	That's the queer part of it, returned the other, promptly.
0.1784	But, early as it was, his mother, was down before him.
0.1785	Probably he was telling him that he had a mortgage on it.
0.1801	Even if it were painted it wouldn't come up to this.
0.1801	That is strange, as you both live in the same village.
0.1803	Don't try to run, or it will be the worse for you.
0.1807	You've got to earn your own living, and your son's.
0.1815	My father wants me to be a professional man -- a lawyer.
0.1817	Well, we can't stop them from doing that, I suppose.
0.1821	Let 'em come on, if they want to mix up with us.
0.1822	It is due to-day, as, of course, you know.
0.183	He has been taking tea at our house and I accompanied him home.
0.1833	He has done more than he vowed to do, people said.
0.1835	Perhaps they come from the land that we are going to find.
0.1838	There's a great deal of difference between the country and the city.
0.1839	I had no idea of such a thing when I came here.
0.184	Don't you want to go home, and carry the news?
0.186	We will go in and see what kind of a place it is.
0.1863	The place is hers, not mine, and she must decide.
0.1867	In that case, he decided, "I will certainly foreclose.
0.1868	We all appreciate the kindly spirit that causes you to make it to us.
0.188	As the mother of my professor, the desire was only natural.
0.1886	In this he set up those statues that had been in his old temple.
0.1887	He told me to engage somebody, and he would pay the bill.
0.1889	I've heard him drum, and he's just a corker at it.
0.1892	There's another walk which I prefer; I mean to Prospect Pond.
0.1894	Then you think he can't send any money to his mother?
0.1897	So they did, and there was a great hill of things around it.
0.1899	Squire Leech, you yourself gave us time to consult what to do.
0.1899	Gladly, and help her too, after you have told me more.
0.1901	And it is no bad place, cried some of the men.
0.1908	I don't call it hard, it is only just and legal.
0.1914	But I will never go again for all the skins in the woods.
0.1916	There are the hills and fields, The streams and rocks that I love.
0.192	I have my husband's word for it, said the widow.
0.1921	You must establish yourself in the city when you are ready to practice.
0.1925	But some men lay down on the benches and drew their cloaks over themselves.
0.1925	Turning round, he found that it was the landlord who had called him.
0.1927	By the way, there is a boy from your town visiting my son.
0.1931	I beg your pardon, sir; we are ready to pay.
0.1931	has in his shop, for he was pleased to let me root around.
0.1935	Yes, a bunch of them have gone in a mighty queer way.
0.1944	Some leaves are lost, some are torn, all are yellow and crumpled.
0.1952	If I get a legacy, I'll take you into my store.
0.1952	You came up here after you saw Karl off on the train?
0.1953	I should think he would, considering your high position in society.
0.1959	And you can take possession of the house, can't you?
0.1967	You said the owner of that boat was an intimate friend of yours.
0.1969	I shouldn't think you'd want to accept it, though.
0.197	Just like you, old fellow, to cheer me up like that.
0.1977	That made the little den as tight as a drum, eh?
0.1977	Yes, he's shielding it from the breeze till it gets strong.
0.198	The question that is bothering me is, where did he get it?
0.198	The child's mother'll never forget you, be sure of that.
0.1982	Then I think I will cut my hair, the king laughed.
0.1987	In that point, I suppose, my readers will fully agree with him.
0.1987	No, he will find it hard to pay his own expenses.
0.1988	For a while he walked the land as though he were in a dream.
0.1988	If there is more than you need, I can sell the surplus.
0.1992	The most we admit is that we mean to make a try for it.
0.1997	I will do so with pleasure, said our hero, politely.
0.1999	As I held it in my fingers, it grew into a tall tree.
0.1999	They jumped up and ran to the shore and stood there with hungry eyes.
0.2001	I don't believe he was sane when he made the will.
0.2003	We have very little good society, I am sorry to say.
0.2004	Men ran after us shouting, but our legs were as good as theirs.
0.2015	He bore hard on the rudder, but he could not turn the ship.
0.2026	Why, we can camp right in the woods if it comes to it.
0.2027	Then the men swung the sail to the wind, and we moved off.
0.2029	I've made up my mind never to go back until he's found.
0.2032	I don't mean even, for I know your boat is better.
0.204	As to that, the boy certainly acted in a very low manner.
0.2041	I have never seen so fair a land as this seems to be.
0.2053	But it must be something very unusual that urges you to do this.
0.2055	See, he has laid the basket down, and stands guard over it.
0.2057	He ran in the woods and climbed the hills and waded in the creek.
0.2057	I'd hate to have either of them know anything about this trouble."
0.2059	There I put the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder.
0.2059	Since God orders all things, we ought not to be discouraged.
0.207	Then he walked to the king's feast hall and went through the door.
0.2075	Fathers looked at their children and thought, they are not learning much.
0.2076	I think you said she had a son; does he earn anything?
0.2078	They're copper coins, you know and I don't suppose worth much.
0.2079	Of course, we shall live in a brownstone front, uptown.
0.2088	He was on the way to town to deliver a big load of truck.
0.2089	They'll provide receptacles for trash, and see that everybody uses them.
0.2095	They hung his sword over his shoulder and laid his spear by his side.
0.2104	Perhaps you will build a house there when you are a rich man.
0.2105	I am obliged to go back to the hotel to write a letter.
0.2112	He was a selfish man, wholly wrapped up in the pursuit of wealth.
0.2113	Shall I leave the den shut up as it is, then?
0.2116	We have all noticed that you are not gay as you used to be.
0.2116	Where people are so poor as we are, every little helps.
0.2121	Temple spoke quietly, as if it were no great matter, after all.
0.2121	Think of the ugly feelings he's made me have toward my own brother.
0.2129	Accordingly he employed a competent man, who had the general supervision of them.
0.2139	Quite in earnest, mother; only it is better than a dream.
0.2157	I am afraid I can't earn that much, he answered.
0.2157	replied the boy, whose face was white with the horror of it all.
0.2158	He threw the bag as far as he could into the woods!
0.216	I can't, father; I don't feel well to-day.
0.2166	No other woman in the world knows so much about herbs as she does.
0.2176	So that was where they came together, a uniformed organization, at last.
0.2176	So they kept up the good work after the scout master had left them.
0.2176	You had better carry it home before you go round with the others.
0.2178	You shall punish any man who steals or murders or does any wicked thing.
0.2181	I am tired of sea, sea, sea, and nothing else.
0.219	Here is a pair of pantaloons; but they are pretty well worn.
0.2191	That spot in my palm burns, and my heart aches to see you.
0.2192	Standing on these logs were a few cattle and sheep and horses and pigs.
