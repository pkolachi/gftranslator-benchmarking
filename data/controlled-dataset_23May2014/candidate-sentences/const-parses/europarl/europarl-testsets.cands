154.4654	I hope with all my heart , and I must say this quite emphatically , that an opportunity will arise when this document can be incorporated into the Treaties at some point in the future .
39.5709	Should this fail to materialise , we should not be surprised if public opinion proves sceptical about Europe , or even rejects it .
91.5213	The Intergovernmental Conference - to address a third subject - on the reform of the European institutions is also of decisive significance for us in Parliament .
280.8294	At present I feel there is a danger that if the proposal by the Belgian Government on these sanction mechanisms were to be implemented , we would be hitting first and examining only afterwards .
660.9609	The Charter therefore guarantees a greater level of protection than the European Convention on Human Rights - this needs to be said to all those who are asserting the opposite here in the plenary - and it formulates political and social rights in a balanced way .
4.9880	We must bear in mind the Community as a whole .
2.6304	But we must reach agreement on what to put in this constitution .
242.0616	I am not a Christian Democrat , so I do not believe in miracles , but I do want to salute the European Parliament as such , because it has made a major contribution to this project .
996.7717	In today ' s debate , I associate myself with the words of all those who have spoken - Mr Moscovici , Mr Napolitano and the heads of Groups - on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights : this is something innovative and , moreover , unhoped-for .
7.9126	This does not mean that everything has to happen at once .
12.0529	Vote
10198.3675	Report -LRB- A5-0231 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Hatzidakis , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 137 - C5-0164 / 2000 - 2000/0060 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB-
376.8453	. Technical cooperation with Russia while the Chechen people are suffering a full-scale genocide is a cause of shame for the European Union at a time when this House has greeted the final version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
88.7225	The Commission also proposes to apply a coefficient to the ` non collectable ' percentage in order to avoid understating the true level of deficit , compared with the Maastricht requirements .
20.2701	Even in countries where 15-metre buses are not allowed officially , in practice they are not refused or sent back at the border .
34.3927	Skinner report -LRB- A5-0235 / 2000 -RRB-
47.7165	Opting for direct government aid when acquiring risk-bearing starting capital for innovative companies means that this aid must mainly be funded by those paying taxes and pension premiums .
139.5527	We did not vote against this resolution because we did not want our votes to be confused with those of the extreme right , which objects to a number of fundamental rights even being affirmed or opposable to the sovereignty of States .
6.5435	The achievement of the colleagues whom I named just now and others has been outstanding here .
572.2473	The content of this document , they say , represents a fundamental step forward for the protection of citizens ' rights in Europe , to the extent that the matter should be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Nice Council should decide to enshrine it in the Treaties .
48.2346	The Charter aims to provide comprehensive protection of people 's fundamental rights and different sections go completely or partly beyond the jurisdiction of the EU .
171.5949	Because social rights are fundamental rights for a Europe that respects democratic and social rights and freedoms , we champion the idea of another charter to protect workers , women , foreigners , those excluded from society , national minorities .
0.3878	It can not serve as a basis for the establishment of a European constitution .
423.0614	-LRB- A5-0247 / 2000 -RRB- by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne on Romania -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 510 - C5-0033 / 2000 - 1997/2172 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RRB- ;
877.0136	I think that this is a good proposal which should be supported , and an equally good proposal is that from the European People 's Party stating that if possible the first countries should be able to participate in the European Parliament elections in 2004 .
308.1753	Our first guideline is that we must , of course , go as far as possible in the accession negotiations in order to draw up a report that is as accurate as possible , in Nice , country by country and chapter by chapter .
337.0882	Next , let me say a few works on the ` Helsinki Six ' , in inverted commas once again , who entered into negotiations at the beginning of this year .
537.9231	Personally , I remain convinced that , in the debate on the date of the first accessions , the European Union must avoid - with very great respect to the European Parliament - trying to make an impact so often .
59.9114	Enlargement is our future , on condition that the acquis communautaire and the common policies which we all value highly are not thereby weakened or watered down .
54.9708	Populists will stand up and maintain that the EU has finally made it clear that , in truth , it does not want any new members .
0.2121	The advantages are already there ; they are visible and everyone stands to gain .
2.0195	We can help countries catch up , but not by putting their neighbours on hold .
24.7084	All the candidate countries are keen to accede to monetary union and accession to monetary union is governed by special terms in the Maastricht Treaty .
15.7039	The costs of enlargement are set out in the current financial perspectives and will be reflected in the budget .
37.1676	The Commission report is right in pointing out that all candidate countries have experienced major reform - and must do so in future .
25.2964	The hallmark of German reunification was that there were politicians who understood the Zeitgeist , who dared to act .
280.3334	The progress and efforts being made in central and eastern Europe give us hope that the first accession treaties will still be able to be ratified in the European Parliament in this parliamentary term .
123.7318	My Group has 23 visiting MPs , our `` virtual MEPs '' , sitting in the gallery now : I welcome all of you to this debate in the House .
136.4157	We must also take our own administrative reforms very seriously if we also wish to root out corruption in future Member States , as transparency and good administration are the best guarantee that there is no corruption .
367.9853	We are also in favour of a European Union that includes Russia , and which therefore includes all the countries which have built - albeit in conflicting ways - this historical , cultural , economic , social and political reality known as Europe .
2683.5117	Our opposition to the Brok report is not an indication of ostracism of our partners in Eastern and Central Europe , or southern Europe , quite the contrary , it means that this report sets conditions which are absolutely intolerable , with regard to countries which have been European for centuries and of which we should not be making any other demand whatsoever except , perhaps , for the one condition that political pluralism be respected .
817.9072	Now , in the previous enlargement processes , particularly when Spain and Portugal joined the Union , we were in possession of a very powerful budgetary tool , for the Delors I and Delors II packages provided an impetus which made it possible for struggling economies to make up for lost time .
472.4300	It was the fall of the Berlin Wall , this fantastic historic event , which created the conditions for enlargement and for European reunification and which , once again , gives perspective and meaning to this task which will go down in the history of our continent .
7.0442	In this information campaign , we must fight exaggerated fears , but also solve problems as they arise .
25.4406	Several years ago in Copenhagen we defined the requisite criteria .
15.4504	As far as the other sine qua non are concerned , they are not within our powers of discretion or disposal .
23.1451	The problem is that , if you set a date , there is a danger that the enthusiasm for reform in these countries will wane .
39.8624	It was said during the debate that opening the borders would cause the immediate collapse of agriculture in certain countries , such as Poland .
375.0705	Mr President , today when I flew from Stockholm , in over Germany and then drove on down to historic Alsace , I could not help but feel grateful for this Europe of mine .
1.5570	Our support and commitment continue - to a large extent , for our own sake .
0.2243	The environment is the area which will constitute a stumbling block in the negotiations .
0.4704	They are simply not entitled to chide this Baltic country like a stupid schoolboy .
94.2413	The process of economic change and fast transition has not only brought successes ; it has also resulted in social differences , increasing regional disparities and huge hidden unemployment , which is why these issues must take priority in the pre-accession strategy .
0.1905	There is a good chance of this , but particular efforts are still needed .
34.3822	The multi-faceted problems and the dangers inherent in the social and economic crisis in the region will not be averted , let alone solved , by isolating it .
219.0486	Despite the words of the Commissioner , who declared himself passionately in favour of enlargement , Brussels sometimes gives the impression that it is trying to slow down the process , and this is reflected in the attitude of the candidate countries whose citizens become despondent and confused .
266.5469	As far as cause for criticism is concerned , as I state in my report , the European Parliament stresses the need to ensure a high standard of safety at nuclear facilities and to carry out the relevant environmental impact assessments .
24.5926	There is that risk and I am going to try to prove the opposite is true in the case of Slovakia .
5.3454	The acquis is also being implemented at a satisfying rate .
192.5597	In this context , the issue of integrating the ethnic gypsy minority into Hungarian society has been central to the discussions held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
583.7442	The rapporteur for Bulgaria , Mr Geoffrey Van Orden , has asked me to speak on his behalf since he has to attend the defence debate at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth , England , today .
206.0782	- Mr President , Romania 's people welcome wholeheartedly the European Union 's Helsinki decision to incorporate Romania in the first wave of the current enlargement countries .
15.3958	We must look forward to Romania becoming a full and active member of the Union without undue delay .
149.2950	I have a duty to point out , however , that transposing the acquis communautaire is taking too long and that Cyprus , like other candidate countries moreover , should tighten up its administrative , fiscal and legal systems .
378.6850	Because of its geopolitical position as the last outpost of Europe , at the crossroads with the Middle East and North Africa , the importance of Malta goes far beyond its geographical size and its small population .
491.2387	Allow me now to jump across to Poland , which is without doubt a key country in the enlargement process , not just because it is the most expansive of all the central European economies but because of its size and geopolitical position .
22.8059	These interim solutions are not intended to set the status quo in stone but to act as intelligent buffers which adapt to changing circumstances .
81.7984	I am speaking on behalf of the Industry Committee - to abbreviate its full title - on the areas of industry , external trade , research and energy .
5.9123	Energy generation and distribution must continue to be made more efficient , while complying with environmental standards .
131.3443	Finally , enlargement is not just a game of words , because we can not improve the human rights situation in Tibet just by translating the human rights declaration into Tibetan .
81.4075	In order to meet all 200 environmental EU requirements , all Eastern European governments together need to spend another EUR 120 billion .
3.4702	We need to try to protect the countryside and the natural areas from any negative impact .
40.8148	There is a message for EU governments and indeed for the Commission : for governments on compliance and the Commission on enforcement .
466.2866	It is essential , ladies and gentlemen , to create a genuine European regional planning policy , of which the Structural Funds are a component , an element , but which gives rise to ambitious actions in favour of balanced and integrated development of the European area in its different dimensions .
45.9682	But it is precisely with the `` how '' and `` when '' that we need to ensure that enlargement is prepared carefully and implemented seriously , in order to guarantee its success .
40.8151	It is important that it should not just become a flag of convenience and that all measures prescribed in the acquis are taken to ensure that safety is writ large .
20.3446	But having said all that , it is questions about how we can survive as a State that have occupied people ' s minds .
25.4027	Within the Union institutions , the views on enlargement continue to be positive and you must therefore contradict every ambassador from your countries who believes otherwise .
99.3095	After such a comprehensive debate , I should just like to address and highlight two questions , which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye .
3.7206	That is important not only for them but also for ourselves .
3.0476	I also call for individual countries to be given possible target dates .
5765.8209	Nor is freedom and security created by the European Union - as Austria , on the one hand , and the Balkans , on the other , know full well - because the European Union is , alas , totally subservient to the United States Government and the nations which have just recovered their sovereignty are soon going to realise that , tomorrow , they will be asked to renounce it in the name of subservience to the supposed world order .
4.5506	It would be just as irresponsible to wish to go further .
14.3924	To these should be added all the other advantages which can not be measured in figures or assessed in economic terms .
22.0515	The speeches of all those who have contributed to today ' s debate on enlargement paint a not-dissimilar picture .
28.4375	Talk about the fast accession to the Union on the part of the applicant countries is just empty words unless the conditions of membership are changed .
5.2854	I visited two of these houses that I can recommend to anyone .
377.9681	The Polish people believe that the country will be ready for accession with effect from 31 December 2002 , and Poland has certainly made great strides since the accession negotiations started in March 1998 .
10.0287	I would therefore call on the government leaders to assume their responsibility and to stop this trend in its tracks .
147.9200	I would merely remind the House that , of all the candidate countries , Cyprus comes first as regards meeting the economic criteria and qualifies for immediate membership of EMU .
9.9434	In other words , a great many issues are based on subsidiarity , and that is how it should stay .
58.1187	I sometimes hear our neighbouring countries asking why we are so bothered about the acquis , when all that matters to them is having it confirmed that they are ready for accession .
7.9691	It is time to lead European opinion in the right direction .
7.8839	It has successfully embraced reforms which are essential to secure a more prosperous and safer future .
274.7243	In the course of the last few years , it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation , due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions .
996.9167	Since Helmut Kohl , Europe ' s citizen of honour , stepped down from the European stage , Jean-Claude Junker is the only other Head of Government I can think of off the top of my head , for whom the European project is a matter truly dear to their heart .
59.5511	In addressing problems such as this , which have no easy solution , it is essential to create an environment conducive to the work of industry and to there being competitive economic structures .
2020.1096	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , ` from problem child to model pupil ' , that is how we could characterise the determination of the Slovakian government and the Slovakian parliament to swiftly tread the path to EU membership , and to spend the past two years making every available effort to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
5.4411	This is where we have to set to work .
32.9185	We must make sure that the countries are ready to join and in particular that they have the administrative capacity to deal with the acquis communautaire .
1710.9622	Mr President , Commissioner , what with the enlargement reports which are the subject of today ' s debate , together with the Brok report and the debate on institutional reform , today can be described , without fear of exaggeration , as a day for celebrating Europe in the 21st century .
345.6720	It is fantastic that countries on this continent which only ten or so years ago were divided are to make joint decisions on matters of common interest in the near future .
100.4848	If transitional periods are to be granted , then it would be both necessary and helpful to include realistic interim goals in the accession treaty , and to regard failure to attain these interim goals as a violation of the treaty .
6.2973	We speak a lot about how enlargement should be financed .
352.3286	Mr President , our task in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , was primarily to assess the situation in the candidate countries with regard to the internal market and the relevant legislation .
145.8235	In this sense , it is a process of development , which we follow attentively , but we hope that Slovenia will continue to hold this positive position and that it will be in the first group .
17.5160	The EEA could act as a kind of hatchery , where EU embryos would mature into fully fledged members
42.1206	Mutual respect , consideration for , and fair treatment of , each other , must form one of the main pillars of our European Community .
1.5761	Firstly , as we see it , enlargement is not merely an obligation .
197.6626	Mr President , with regard to yesterday ' s debate on Slovakia , I should like to point out that Belgium and other countries have introduced a visa requirement for Slovakia .
9.6172	There are none .
71.7465	Twelve years ago the Court of Justice gave a judgment against Italy in the case of the foreign language lecturers .
12.7190	Animal nutrition
0.2297	I totally agree with all the proposals tabled by the Commission on this issue .
227.2620	When it comes to the directive on the official control of the field of animal nutrition , it is important that we really do have a form of inspection which is implemented and which is the same throughout the European Union .
175.5348	One of the strong points of the proposal is the principle of non-dilution , which prohibits using healthy feedingstuffs to dilute a batch of animal feedingstuffs contaminated by , for example , dioxins .
331.6559	In all our deliberations , however , we must be mindful of the entire supply chain ; in other words , we need what Mr Glavany , the French President of the Council , has called a quality pact between society , industry and agriculture .
1633.6342	During one of the greatest of all food crises , namely the BSE crisis , the House managed to cooperate in a spirit of mutual confidence , irrespective of party affiliations , and I should have found it very regrettable if , at such a juncture as this , a pseudo-interest group - for it would not have been a genuine interest group - had carried the day .
11.5807	This crisis not only cost billions of euros , but also resulted in even more suspicion about what we eat .
8.4922	Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report .
167.3021	Our citizens are fed up with being forced to be happy , of being hampered a little more every day in their activities by petty , pernickety and stifling red tape .
3.7575	That is not just a precaution , it is common sense .
5.8054	These proposals also mean a step towards a complete package of measures in favour of food safety .
65.5593	I am confident that with this systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation and enhancing food safety throughout the food chain .
3.6113	The full declaration certainly costs money , and the farmer ultimately has to foot the bill .
34.4897	From my own conversations , however , I know that I am not speaking for a majority of the House on this particular point .
37.6742	The good quality of the former is regulated by legislation on hygiene and the directive on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is most essential with regard to the latter .
2851.2909	Although the definition does not preclude water being considered as feedingstuff , it is clear from the Community legislation that water has not until now been considered as feedingstuff , as is clear from the fact that Council Directive 96/25 of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials , containing a non-exhaustive list of the main feed materials , does not include water in the list .
27.2979	More generally , it is appropriate that the provisions of the annexes are periodically reviewed in the light of the developments of scientific and technological knowledge .
963.9576	The Commission can not accept Amendments Nos 2 , 14 , 17 - the first sentence in particular - and 19 concerning the deletion of the adjective `` serious '' when clarifying a risk for consistency with our general policy laid down in the General Products Safety Directive .
28.8775	I hope that our cooperation will continue with the same positive results when this proposal is discussed at the second stage .
186.8863	That has been the worst part of the present regime , because it meant , for example , that the term ` fats ' could cover all sorts of fat and that there was no indication at all as to the origins of the fat content .
99.2114	We must have a clear and unequivocal white list , and both committees - the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee - have reiterated that point .
13.9362	Equally important , of course , is the food-safety aspect - beef is another issue here - and traceability .
47.3462	I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union .
46.1139	Of course , farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil , which contains dioxins .
219.6402	As far as checks on feedingstuffs are concerned , I should like to state that the problem is not so much the lack of a European legal framework as the failure of the individual Member States to transpose the existing provisions .
0.2060	It is also what we want , namely trust between the producer and consumer .
291.6049	As stressed in the report by these two committees , this proposal was initiated by the European Parliament out of a concern to improve both traceability and the provision of information through the labelling of compound-feeding stuffs .
24.4163	The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m .
6.7974	In connection with human rights , only a brief mention was made here of the Romanies .
1257.6194	Mr President , the reason for this amendment concerns the fact that recital c -RRB- highlights the persistence of segregation in children ' s education and serious discrimination in the various sectors of Hungarian civil society , from the economy to the public sector , which in its seriousness does not correspond to my perception of the current situation , which I have had the opportunity to observe as rapporteur and during my visits there .
1446.0281	The new wording of Recital A , which would become Paragraph 1 , and which I propose to the House , would read as follows : ` Whereas Slovenia must continue to meet the Copenhagen political criteria also in those areas where questions remain open , as specifically mentioned in the Commission ' s 1999 report . '
20.8778	The economies of these countries are already at the mercy of the law laid down by the great European trusts .
3383.3405	I refer in particular to paragraph 19 of the report ' s draft resolution in which it is stated that the European Parliament 'em phasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global , irreversible political project ... which does not mean mere membership of a currency area but which greatly entails coordination of economic and social policies ' .
88.5146	I should also like to remind you that this process must not cause us to neglect the cooperation with the countries on all sides of the Mediterranean to which we are committed !
39.0218	We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement , that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost .
286.7590	Nevertheless , in order to prevent Europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area , the European Union must provide clear answers to the institutional , social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise .
66.1717	'' The various structural adjustment plans demand forced privatisations in all strategic sectors : finance , insurance , industry , education , and public services , etc. , and impose budgetary restrictions .
8.9335	Less would have amounted to more !
31.3331	This is my view , and the purpose of my abstention was to emphasise that this Parliament would have done better to produce less paper but more substance .
175.4520	Is it really in the interest of farmers in Poland or Hungary to condemn themselves to becoming redundant within two decades of entering the Union ?
3.5622	Thirdly , the implications of enlargement for the Union 's regional policy can not be overlooked .
12.0230	This is certainly positive and we should congratulate the Republic of Estonia on this and its other merits .
528.3959	Like the rapporteur , I should like to express my pleasure at the considerable progress which Latvia has made in recent months in order to be included in the first wave of enlargement that the European Union is shortly to experience .
34.3927	Gawronski Report -LRB- A5-0246 / 2000 -RRB-
3.0979	The country should , moreover , make greater efforts to combat corruption .
556.7881	Mr President , I voted for the report on the current status of the Czech Republic 's application for membership of the European Union and I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of that country .
65.2623	Mr President , I voted for the report on the current status of Slovakia 's application for membership of the European Union .
309.6832	If Hungary continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Hungary should not be admitted to the Union .
861.9928	Sadly , this phenomenon is not restricted to Romania alone , but I particularly hope that the Romanian authorities will distinguish themselves by eliminating this fault as well - which is particularly apparent in their preparations for accession to the European Union - and respect civil rights .
190.0192	I feel that this step and the entry of Cyprus into the European Union will prove extremely important in terms of bringing peace to this tortured island in our Mediterranean .
151.7027	The UN settlement process has now lasted since December 1999 without a break , longer than any of the previous attempts to solve the Cyprus problem .
97.6143	The European Union does have the capacity to make a key contribution to the security of the Cypriot communities in the context of a peace settlement .
76.9316	Like the rapporteur , I too welcome the Helsinki Council agreement not to make a solution to the division of the island a pre-condition for accession .
107.2519	The safety bolt guaranteeing this discipline lies in the Commission ' s determination to ensure that consumers are provided with consistent quality , at all levels , in the products available on the market .
9.5255	The prohibition of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs is therefore a basic element in our food safety policy .
29.9363	I welcome the vote by this Parliament deploring the flagrant violations of James ' rights under UN international law .
19.2041	A politician can have no greater responsibility than to be given the opportunity to redress the wrongs so often visited upon minorities .
13.4682	Now is the time to do the job and it must be done with every fibre of our being .
12.7152	Some undertakings reject applicants for continuing and ongoing training on the pretext that they are too young or too old .
4.2635	Fifthly , religious communities , perhaps one of the most sensitive areas of our directive .
10.6156	Next we booked a disabled access hotel only to find that a single bed was put across the bathroom .
28.0946	This summer , the Council adopted a directive to combat discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin .
5.2416	For this reason , the sum total of the appropriations must be allocated to financing operating expenditure .
23.5380	I , too , congratulate both the rapporteurs , Mr Cashman and Mr Mann , on their excellent work .
140.1247	It is very important that organisations representing the people affected are listened to , because they will help us make the transition from fine words here today to practical policies that work in our Member States .
67.1089	Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative to develop Article 13 of the Treaty further .
32.1572	I urgently call on the Commission to adopt this recommendation and to do justice to the tolerance and pluralism desired by the representatives of so many States .
9.5867	I would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group .
853.2851	We can not accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century , seeing the disabled socially marginalised , or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different .
143.1396	I would like to remind you that the first action of the members of the Bonino List this parliamentary term was to promote a proposal for a resolution on the fight against discrimination based on sex .
25.5719	Discrimination in the sense of treating people as inferior , taunting them and putting them at a disadvantage is an evil that must be eradicated .
4.5384	I do not think we should ask too much of anybody .
99.0758	Yet we were even more impressed by fact that , at the end of the report , provision was made for an evaluation of the outcome of the processes and programmes , for this is also a guarantee of fairness , impartiality and transparency .
12.1982	They will also be expected to respond to the needs of the potential workforce , particularly in the area of disability .
33.2872	Yet , should the law not provide the victims of discrimination with better means to escape the isolation they too often find themselves in ?
488.3946	Our entire dispute with the United States , moreover , has arisen because we wanted positive discrimination in favour of our own ACP banana producers whereas the United States wanted an egalitarian system which would serve the interests of multinationals .
54.0389	The amount should be at least equal to the sums made available for the preparations for this programme , to make it possible to implement it fully and effectively .
312.0525	As we all know , the causes of discrimination must be rooted out right from the start - and the work of prevention is just as vital - through information , education and training in the promotion of equality and the fight against prejudice , changing attitudes through the various forms of positive action , particularly favouring groups that are discriminated against , or by appealing to the relevant authorities whenever employers persist in discrimination .
9.8736	I thank Mr Mann for his support on this point .
114.2847	It is almost acceptable in its original form because , essentially , it is directed at something fundamental , that is , educating European society in the value of the human being , of whatever type .
30.2218	Mr President , I should like to underline what my colleague Mr HernÃ ¡ ndez Mollar has just said .
23.0021	I welcome the rather obvious fact that priests and ministers can be restricted to the relevant faith without promoting accusations of illegal discrimination .
29.3260	On the subject , now , of the programme to combat discrimination , the Commission ' s proposals are satisfactory .
1.4856	The family , for instance , remains a foundation and a pillar of our society .
364.6193	In terms of social solidarity , human rights and social justice , and in terms of the internal market , it is very important to understand that we must have the same minimum social standards in all Member States and in the applicant countries in the future as well .
444.3926	Others risk creating an imbalance in programmes by an over-concentration on a particular aspect ; others again are not necessary to achieve Parliament 's objective , as the ideas are either implicitly or explicitly already included in the decision , such as those on drawing on the experience of third countries .
35.4642	The Commission 's intention is to create workable rules for companies while at the same time prohibiting instances of discrimination which are arbitrary and not objectively justified .
55.0369	I agree that it is very important and I pledge that it will be a communication : we will examine this in the text of the communication we have already announced in the social agenda .
47.5303	Some of the Members have referred to the particular problems that Turkey has with the Kurdish language and the problems in Turkey .
19.0649	Yet today , thanks to the Finnish Presidency , we are able to discuss the annual report .
7.6071	They should be better coordinated and more effective .
30.9356	That said , since I am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground , I will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation .
475.1187	Mr President , this Parliament has always argued in favour of improving EU laws on arms export and , partly as a result of these pleas , we now have a code of conduct which we are able to debate today for the first time .
1.4768	I would like to underline this , also on behalf of my group .
1034.7209	The third criterion , the needs and challenges of the European defence industries , and to a certain extent criterion 4 , the development of a common defence policy , are potentially and factually at odds with criterion 1 , namely the consistency of the Union ' s external action , whereby its objectives regarding conflict prevention and promotion of human rights prevail .
61.7024	But the arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy , with which of course the Commission is fully associated .
41.7047	We agree with the rapporteur that further efforts are needed in establishing common rules for controlling the legal trade and for eradicating trafficking and smuggling in such arms .
88.2447	It proposes guidelines for future Union research activities , for the period 2002-2006 , and more especially for the Union 's future Research Framework Programme .
15.6758	The guideline document adopted today is designed to trigger debate immediately , beginning with debate within the institutions .
31.9993	This is the discussion on criteria that we will be having with the Member States , of course , and also with Parliament .
255.8389	In a resolution quoted by yourself , which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur , I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research , since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines .
97.4535	Yes , with an opening-up of the national programmes of several Member States onto an area with European added value , the Commission and the Union can intervene .
1.5876	I would therefore welcome any form of debate or discussion on this issue .
688.1804	Mr President , Mr Harbour and Mr PiÃ © trasanta - I apologise for not having replied to your question - firstly , as concerns pilot experiments for 2000-2001 , we will make every effort to accurately assess the feasibility of certain elements , including that of networking .
9.8210	I indeed feel that , in Europe , research and development must be conducted with the citizens .
342.7056	In the case of Portugal , Mrs Torres Marques , but above all in the case of Greece , the number of projects received does not give me the same cause to hope for a satisfactory implementation of appropriations .
70.2303	You know that this fund has always been very well managed by the four countries and has always had 100 % take-up rates .
3096.8147	I provided all this information to the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism on 11 September , but , if you really wanted , I could arrange for this information to be transmitted to you this evening or tomorrow , in the form that it was submitted , in all transparency , to the competent Committee on 11 September , under a month ago , for all the countries concerned .
409.5021	Eventually , in 1992 , the Member States unanimously decided on the introduction of a Community system of tax levies on mineral oils which only provided for a minimum tax rate for each type of mineral oil on the basis of its use ; i.e. as fuel for motor vehicles , for industrial and commercial use or for heating .
524.8670	I want to be clear and insist on this point , because , as I said in my answer in the first instance , the Commission has made several attempts to get Member States to agree to the harmonisation of excise taxes precisely to avoid distortions in trade which may arise as a result of the differences therein .
149.8383	Although the precise shape of the elasticity curve is something we may debate , the fact that it exists is certain if one looks at the oil-intensity of the economy and how that intensity has changed .
29.4964	From my point of view , I look after the fiscal matters of the Union , insofar as I am allowed to do so by the Member States .
7.5140	Out of a total of 750 million inhabitants , 100 million belong to minority groups .
50.1303	In the past the Commission 's executive tasks have increased while its political and legislative work has decreased in relative terms .
2398.5218	Thirdly , how , in the light of enlargement towards the East , do you interpret the decision to remove resources from a practical fight in Sweden , Austria and Germany against child sex tourism when we know that there are special problems involving the sex trade and trade in human beings in a large number of the candidate countries ?
17.8853	Support for ECPAT is incredibly important .
48.5096	Indeed many SMEs are still not fully aware of the implications of the changeover for their businesses , particularly as regards the legal tax and accounting rules and their software .
25.2876	Question No 8 by -LRB- H-0724 / 00 -RRB- :
4.9770	The fact is that elk hunting is extremely widespread in Sweden and Finland .
9.4496	The Commission is currently monitoring the situation in both cases .
10.4887	We are considering infringement proceedings in relation to this Member State but no such proceedings have been initiated as yet .
208.4716	Under this plan the Member States would immediately organise testing of a significant number of seed lots of conventional varieties to determine the presence of GM seeds until the coming into force of related new Community legislative measures .
27.1122	There are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the Directive on the Safety in the Workplace but none yet for private use .
294.4026	From a logical point of view I entirely agree.The difficulty in this issue is that the Commission and the European institutions have far greater powers in legislation governing the workplace than in , for instance , legislation governing private homes .
7.6203	What will the Commission do in this case ?
524.9829	I am particularly concerned by reports that party members , waiting with Aung San Suu Kyi at Rangoon station two weeks ago , were attacked and even chloroformed before being evicted from the station premises .
64.0007	This is where the whole question of whether or not it is worth engaging in a dialogue is one that has to think about very carefully .
1014.7677	Mr President , the Commission fully supports the decision of the UN Secretary General 's special representative for Kosovo , Bernard Kouchner , to hold the Kosovo municipal elections on 28 October and the efforts of the UN mission in Kosovo , UNMIK , to organise these elections .
153.5504	I hope that will continue , that the election process will produce results in which everybody in Kosovo from every group will be able to feel that they are sharing in the administration of their local communities .
9.0347	Arms trade code of conduct -LRB- continuation -RRB-
6.3263	Finally , arms fuel conflicts all over the world .
115.3593	We only have to look at Indonesia and the fact that the European Union could not wait to lift the arms embargo , or to not reinstate it .
327.7266	We should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldiers engaged in peace missions do not have to confront , as they occasionally do , arms exported by the European Union .
1079.1012	The proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flows directly from the recommendations formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts , which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year .
14.4132	First , the division of responsibilities between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified .
326.6188	My report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institutions to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusions arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems .
135.1140	I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular , namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control .
41.8082	Like several Member States , I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce .
60.7769	Otherwise , my group is able to support all the rapporteur ' s amendments , especially those which stipulate that annual progress reports should be compiled .
1.9765	However , we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control .
70.7615	We know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament , but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary .
168.1467	On the question of the Financial Regulation in general , let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages .
442.4030	Let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2 , which - most importantly - provides for an annual report by the financial controller , to ensure greater transparency .
404.5462	Firstly , we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors : I refer , in particular , to filtering systems and programme classification systems .
2.7825	Television and the Internet have to be learned and , of course , also taught .
4.0468	Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis .
251.4741	In so far as the President of the Commission has had any ideas about which areas belong where , I hope that he shares my view that issues of parental control of children ' s television viewing do not belong on the EU ' s agenda .
9.4951	Aside from all the positive aspects , we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access .
5.7527	This occurred not far away and not very long ago .
70.4297	Mr President , I should like to thank both the European Parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which has been done on this issue .
503.6569	Where , finally , the protection of minors is concerned , I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national frameworks designed to ensure comparable and effective levels of protection of minors and of human dignity .
1273.5605	Since then , a great deal of work by my own staff , by Parliament 's staff and indeed by the Commission 's own staff , to all of whom I pay warm tribute , has presented us with what I thought , until today , was perhaps a worthy if not perfect report , certainly one that was satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims .
48.8513	I would draw attention , out of the amendments tabled , to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers , since this category was originally included in the Green Paper .
34.4565	This is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students , volunteers , university teachers and researchers - yes , I include researchers in this as well .
5.3052	Questions of responsibility have also been raised , especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning .
391.9454	What this highlighted was that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students , there will be inequality between those whose parents can afford to send them and those whose parents can not .
4.7925	We are not only protecting the rights of young people , since the same applies to researchers .
15.0434	Finally , we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications , periods of study and training .
9.4038	At the Council meeting in Nice , mobility will be one of the items for discussion .
22.1162	-LRB- The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m. -RRB-
240.3849	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am aware of the significance and responsibility of addressing Parliament , which is the sole European body to be directly and democratically elected .
3.3069	Enlargement requires reinforcement ; reinforcement facilitates enlargement but does not compromise it .
459.1916	Against the backdrop of the many centuries of our continent 's history , the idea of Europe was translated in a relatively short space of time from a utopian ideal into agreements , institutions , into a community and now into a Union .
405.5253	First , as regards the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work , employment , education , training , family life , health , and the dignity of women , we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination .
3.0781	We must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative .
578.0189	This is a particularly important advance for women , as Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she presents her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
88.5935	Combining work and family life , entitlement to paid maternity leave , rights of a more general scope , such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity , also appear in the Charter .
578.7248	Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , covering equal opportunities for men and women and Article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the European Union .
405.8050	Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP , Mrs DybkjÃ ¦ r for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks ' campaigning .
1.7144	An ombudsman for equality issues should be introduced , and in the candidate countries too .
60.9419	It would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law , as competition in the job market has become so fierce .
11.9710	The European method , imposing uniformity , is wrong .
61.6044	I do smile sometimes in this House , particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women , especially in Denmark .
8.9812	The number of dual earner households has grown considerably .
75.2386	After all , it is the cool , rational , enlightened thinking which advances human beings as independent , autonomous creatures and downgrades women to being the second sex .
191.4520	Five years ago , we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject , one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business .
45.7555	I would like to remind our President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , of the important speech he made here .
200.9488	The reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward , but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics , we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men .
112.1538	We have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing .
11.2296	In conclusion , I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address .
21.5996	We can not continue with an elitist debate , we can not continue to have progress only benefiting those women who enjoy greater opportunities .
23.8071	I will now respond generally on the issues , rather than give individual answers to any one of you .
17.6658	Fifth point : the Charter .
796.2981	The second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which , at European level , is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23 % to 24 % and , in some regions of Europe , is as high as 40 % .
12.3341	Community customs code
421.6760	The Council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rules - specifically for combating fraud .
16.9255	Let us hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees .
57.3053	I think that the modifications are very positive , but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in Community customs .
52.9260	That has been , as is known , the outcome of a long debate in the Council , during which debate the Commission staunchly defended its view .
8.8348	I am sorry about that .
6.0007	Perhaps you could get your services to check this .
1.5102	Explanations of vote - Recommendation for second reading Palacio Vallelersundi -LRB- A5-0254 / 2000 -RRB-
252.3742	Everyone agrees that this mobility must be encouraged in the name of the free movement of persons , but also and especially because of all the benefits to the young citizens of Europe and hence the European Union .
645.8103	As the rapporteur said , the Commission appears to be aware that , unless concrete measures are adopted , certain fundamental freedoms that are enshrined in the Treaty , such as the right of residence and the right of free movement , are , in practice , in danger of becoming mere statements of principle .
24.8943	Report Mann -LRB- A5-0264 / 2000 -RRB-
67.6780	This article has been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament , which complicates the wording , but does not alter the general thrust .
21.9964	As regards the action programme to fight discrimination , the European Commission ' s proposal was broadly satisfactory .
22.0508	This directive gives Member States a great opportunity to enhance the rights of workers across the European Union .
7.4123	If absurdity could kill then the authors of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us .
182.1910	However , we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act , although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required .
192.1820	We believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the UK and other EU countries .
190.7183	Rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the Commission proposal : what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit .
0.2388	If this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome .
140.3948	The report also means that Europe ' s war industry is regarded as an economically important industry , and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people .
85.6679	Consequently , I can not support these viewpoints , expressed either in Recital R or in Paragraphs 1 c , 1 d and 1 e .
284.3543	The Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate findings as regards the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of children and , consequently , on the dangers in store for tomorrow ' s society as the result of their watching these programmes and using these products .
62.8374	There is no single European definition of a minor nor is there full agreement on what is or is not harmful to minors watching certain television programmes .
102.3137	I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations , both from the private and the public sector within the European Union , will engage positively in this process .
55.5364	It must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law , the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist .
78.1802	Women are still one of the most vulnerable sections of society , whose rights are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system .
297.0389	B5-0777 / 2000 , by Mr Medina Ortega and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the crisis in Peru ;
666.1191	The European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main groups committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru .
0.4572	I feel that this resolution marks a key point in Parliament 's political initiative .
14.4347	If these weaknesses are not dealt with , there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too .
122.8045	It is an important resolution because Afghanistan and its desperately suffering people , and especially its children who are blown up by mines and its women who face appalling discrimination , deserve far more attention from us .
16.8481	The international community can no longer content itself with burying its head in the sand , and conducting ` wait-and-see ' diplomacy .
219.9220	There are a few examples I could mention : the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user , so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there , support for non-governmental organisations and women ' s organisations based there , which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation .
1954.7644	Mr President , today , just as and even more so than in the past , the tragic military success of the Taliban has meant that hundreds of thousands of women are subject to severe repression and are denied medical assistance , education , the possibility of supporting themselves and the freedom of movement .
145.7796	I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapons from reaching the hands of people who are committing very serious violations against human rights , as these people are .
9.7635	The joint debate is closed .
112.4687	Fortunately , in this particular case , we can welcome the fact that the Spanish Jesuit and other Spaniards , as well as other Community citizens , have been released .
0.4370	We urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes .
280.1465	B5-0788 / 2000 , by Mr Lagendijk and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , law on higher education and universities in Macedonia .
50.5440	Therefore , I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem , and have now paved the way to this end .
156.8060	Finally , I would like to spend a moment on something which , normally speaking , I do not think belongs in a European Parliament , namely the role of a fellow countryman .
2552.6678	Even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit , the more divided the systems , and the more separatist the movements , the better - I would like to make the point here , which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia , that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions .
13.0918	I believe the same will apply to Macedonia .
4.9274	The directive on life-saving equipment , life-jackets and life-rafts was infringed .
1044.5892	We need to debate and to call , as we do in the resolution , for the absolute application - with no derogations - of Community legislation , which is inadequate and needs to be enriched ; we need to call for and encourage modernisation and improvements in port infrastructures , crew training in modern equipment , crews which , I should like to add , Mr President , are among the most experienced in the world .
7.1730	That is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission .
2435.2542	The fact that the ill-fated ship was 34 years old and was not included on the list of ships which - and this too is wrong - were exempted from the additional inspections required under Directive 98/18 / Ã ... C , is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always finds a way , for which governments and regulatory authorities are to blame , of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations , at the expense of passenger and shipping safety .
5.2973	We can not afford to make the same mistake again .
61.0690	As a result of the check requested by the Commission , 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards .
18.1808	The sitting was suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
505.6659	We call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share its burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts , who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many , both in Serbia and in several other countries .
236.7871	I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak , President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement .
691.6487	I think that this is a commitment that we need to reiterate today , unanimously , and I urge the Secretary of the Council , the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission not to give up on their efforts and to express this unanimous will of all the peoples and all the representatives of the European Union .
1220.1750	My question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following : what could the European Union do in very concrete terms in order , first of all , to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances , and secondly , to bring the peace process back on track ?
5.9446	It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions ; we must enforce the law .
58.9822	And here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States , France and Egypt in particular .
87.7873	If the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process , it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action .
15.3359	I expected today ' s events to take place last Monday .
712.9601	Here , too , I have one thing to say : we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro , but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states .
6.1614	Our group has confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make .
261.6048	A unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important , as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks .
198.7478	If I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen , who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert , I would not now know what I was supposed to be voting on .
8.2050	We have all been very industrious .
190.2596	In this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect .
780.7622	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion , which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia , deals with two important matters .
279.1613	The chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into , and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year .
1675.1396	I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which is right in saying that this loan is important , but that , in the final analysis , the overall programme , given the necessary financial backing , is more important .
15.7103	We must now consider the bigger picture .
263.5342	Along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence , this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-Ã - vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country .
10.0092	As far as Croatia is concerned , there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement .
128.1433	Mr President , first of all I must declare a personal interest , I have a son-in-law who was , and is , a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia .
11.4943	Adjournment of the session
144.5882	Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , since our last part-session , a fortnight ago , three more people have been shot and killed by ETA .
1.1406	Madam President , last week , the MEP Karla Peijs was attacked in Brussels .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
172.5287	That was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley was released by the Burmese authorities last week .
59.6280	Just because , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business .
7.6872	We therefore propose postponing examination of this report .
19.2773	-LRB- Parliament rejected the request -RRB-
21.9463	The request for a reprieve that you mentioned , Madam President , does not alter this situation , as it is not a legal appeal .
2309.9286	Madam President , I certainly do not require the two minutes allocated to me because , after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr ZappalÃ , from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament , there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira ' s immunity should not be waived .
5.2345	Secondly , I would like to comment on the instruments .
720.7548	We must also make it clear that the social agenda does not intend to impose a uniform social policy but to coordinate , support and boost national policies within a global framework for social development , because all Member States currently face common challenges , which are naturally of varying proportions , such as working structures , discrimination against citizens and gender inequalities .
9.6823	The French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work .
417.8472	You will understand , given my duties as a member of the French Government , that I was particularly pleased to note that , firstly , the equality of men and women and , secondly , lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support .
7.0606	I am thinking in particular of non-standard work .
1.7125	It is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination .
3.5875	We do not therefore share the report ' s predilection for legislation at EU level .
245.2370	It is also important to ensure quality in health , an improved social situation , and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity .
39.6544	Finally , I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments .
158.2872	The Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker ' s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy .
56.5024	I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter , something we could not have done without .
78.7724	What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy , based on the Lisbon Decisions , indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature .
75.4605	Neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative means for new jobs , new technologies and the information society , where I think women have an important role to play .
10.8749	We need modern , European social harmonisation , not deregulation .
3.3884	The second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy .
2401.1658	Finally , as far as procedures are concerned , I really must congratulate Parliament on its initiative in starting a dialogue with the civil society and the important contribution which this dialogue made to the agenda , as well as highlight the discussions which took place with Parliament , with the Member States and with the social partners at European and national level ; this is how we were able to combine national idiosyncrasies and ensure , above all , that the Agenda is not merely ambitious but flexible and efficient .
61.6700	It is also incredibly important , not to say fundamental , that the various Community actions , the framework strategy and the Member States ' measures complement , and do not counteract , each other .
376.5391	Commissioner , we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission ' s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years .
28.8292	Financial resources are indispensable , as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do .
4.2951	For too long , women ' s role has been despised .
1.7913	I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course .
34.9906	We need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender , which will also help to solve some of the other problems above .
211.3766	More emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women ' s organisations , which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme .
1940.6701	Mr President , I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson , who has endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for us to accept the programme as quickly as possible , so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programmes and can start implementing the fifth programme in January .
1020.1033	-LRB- A5-0290 / 2000 -RRB- tabled by Mrs Riis-JÃ ¸ rgensen , on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 -LSB- SEC -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 720 - C5-0302 / 2000 - 2000/2153 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB- ;
169.0466	I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully , especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement .
7.5531	I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share .
73.6634	I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today .
15.0078	The second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18 .
59.6224	Lastly , Commissioner , there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service , which is a concept that is fading fast .
89.5974	What I mean - and this is directed at the public , not the Commission - is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation , but must instead lead to Europeanisation .
155.2722	Without a properly administered competition policy , neither the European Union ' s economy nor its external manifestation , in the form of the euro , will ever be able to achieve its full potential .
17.1648	Secondly , the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities .
1697.6547	On the subject of explaining competition policy , I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition Days , which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year .
543.1050	As you know , on 9 and 10 November , the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg , a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper .
39.9178	Concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned , I have already expressed my regret about that resignation .
9.0751	Financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments
478.8468	On that occasion , the Council endorsed the Commission ' s position , which recommended that the mechanism should be continued , and decided that a further assessment , carried out according to the same procedure , would be necessary in the light of the changes linked to the commencement of the third stage .
173.2913	As far as I am concerned , French vine propagators should also be in a position to propagate vines for the German or Italian market , and vice versa .
0.2724	'' Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs ?
175.0745	The base legislation in force dates from 1968 , a long way back , and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then : new materials have been tried out , often using natural methods and sometimes genetic modification .
114.3027	Commissioner , Mrs Klass , listen to the opinions of the experts from the Institut national des appellations d'origine , the French National Appellations Institute .
50.2087	Moreover , these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
606.4051	While the Council of State was in the process of examining the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen , the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequences of this appeal , nor even from assessing the decision taken .
128.1405	I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be ` auto nomoi ' , which means ` having its own laws ' , and as the rapporteur says `` its own rules '' .
69.8084	Thus , while certain deep-seated reservations persist concerning taxation , some form of progress will still be possible thanks to the technical adjustments that the Presidency is to look into with the help of the Commission .
70.8083	Work will now continue in a very intensive manner up to Nice , on the basis of the informal guidelines adopted by this European Council .
1555.1766	It was precisely with this in mind that President Kostunica was invited , as you will be aware , to take part in the summit meeting between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans , which is to be held in Zagreb , at the instigation of the President of the French Republic , on 24 November .
12.2020	In saying this , ladies and gentlemen , I have in mind a number of points that are still under discussion .
65.3979	Another point of criticism - but the weather can always improve - is that we have quite obviously failed to make any progress to speak of when it comes to majority decisions in the Council of Ministers .
9.8307	With regard to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council , Parliament has no essential criticisms .
1.9221	We must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments .
73.0914	Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the enlargement of the Union is a means of increasing stability and safety in Europe and of promoting tolerance and democracy .
107.8682	It is very important , as part of the process that has started , for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction , stability and promotion of human rights in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia .
42.2231	The heart of the matter is that the Ã © lites who are keenest on integration want to be able to make decisions without broad democratic support .
113.0620	You can in any case rest assured , Mr President , that it is the genuine desire of the Presidency of the Council to seek out a compromise that suits everyone .
27.8436	Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo asked several questions which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision .
197.7804	I will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process , one in which we are well versed , of having the Charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions .
18112.4355	I believe that now , in this policy of forward movement , the inclusion in Article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Treaty on European Union is very important , as there is no sense - and I do not wish to be inconsistent - in the European Union deciding not to provide a legal basis in the Treaty for the Union to be able to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights and , at the same time , talking in the same paragraph about the interpretation of fundamental rights based on this same European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights .
13.1470	No one in this Parliament would understand it if no agreement on this issue was reached at Nice .
3.3372	It therefore comes as no surprise that governments clashed on essential issues .
304.9993	A third and final course of action , which no one has talked about but which seems to me very important , is the need to also incorporate a revision clause into the Charter so that we have a dynamic rather than a static text .
17.2093	Let us reflect for a moment on the ratification procedure for any newly revised European Union treaty .
157.8356	Four revisions in fifteen years have not improved matters , and now we are expected to believe that a charter or a constitution might do something to change things .
2.0960	Sometimes the intergovernmental conference looks like an anxious administrative bureaucracy trying to share out power .
2.9124	Mr President , there are many important issues which must be solved .
24.3403	Now , the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have .
416.2204	Nevertheless , we all know that there are huge numbers of citizens , both in Israel and in Palestine , who are simply finding out - in the hope of peace - how tough life is as long as peace has not really been established .
205.8153	The members of Forza Italia voted for the Charter in Europe and I am able to inform you officially that we will vote for it here in Strasbourg in November .
58.8678	Biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the European Union .
333.6905	In the past , the European Union has been successful in those areas where the Monnet method and majority decision-making are applied , and where the institutions , i.e. Parliament and the Commission , have been strengthened .
3156.4255	Mr President , Mr Moscovici , Commissioner Barnier , although no progress was made at the Biarritz summit in the area of essential structural reform of the Union , I have faith in the ability of France , as the country holding the Presidency of the Council , under the leadership of her innovative President Chirac , to pilot structural solutions too in a direction which will cause the stream of development to continue to flow and which is acceptable to all at Nice also .
78.6963	I would point out that right from the start the Commission indicated that it was in favour of the idea of giving legal effect to this Charter .
448.2364	Lastly , as Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo and Mr Poettering have just suggested , I believe that we must indeed raise the debate to the political level and the correct level , that of the final decision , which is to say the level of Heads of State and Government .
210.4946	To the right of us , we have Joseph de Maistre , the counter-revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of a constitution , because a constitution is made - shock , horror !
377.2843	Peace , prosperity , democracy and justice are values which , each in their own way , virtually all the Members and the groups in Parliament , and the majority of elected representatives and political groups wish to see achieved by Europe and for Europe .
31.5073	The report proposes these two phases as commitments that should be entered into at Nice , because it is possible .
637.5179	Mr President , I am outlining here a resolution which was approved and discussed last week by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank the Chairman , Mr Napolitano , who conducted the proceedings and signed the resolution .
88.9126	I note , at any rate , that for today , the last matter has not been referred to us , and I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Barnier .
493.0869	Objectively speaking , this is a real matter of principle which makes it impossible , in my view , to adopt exactly the same rules within each area of reinforced cooperation as within the European Union , and this is all the more true in the very specific and delicate area of foreign security and defence policy .
10.3311	Let me come back to the three matters I mentioned .
229.2495	As usual , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , with its chairman , and yourself , Mr Segni , brought up questions that were both extremely pertinent but also extremely complex .
7.6610	We now need to work together to ensure that this intention or direction actually becomes reality .
0.4208	Commissioner Barnier , you made this point a moment ago , and rightly so .
6.6076	Openness and transparency must be ensured under all circumstances .
298.4923	The people of Europe need , deserve and , according to opinion polls , want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU ' s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States .
70.7720	The Council ' s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union ' s democratic deficit .
555.9402	The main aim behind this , which is not clearly stated in the resolution , would be to lay down for Europe , even for the fundamental texts , majority-style collective decision-making procedures , completely different , therefore , to the unanimous Council votes or the votes on ratification by Member States used today to amend the Treaties .
13.3243	According to paragraph 4 , we need a constitution because the Treaties are `` unreadable and invisible '' .
1855.9978	When the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam inserted a special reference to islands into Article 158 on economic and social cohesion , adding the word `` islands '' as a special category under the regions which deserve particular attention within the context of cohesion policies , we here in the European Parliament who had first fought for this development thought that it marked the start of a new era for island regions .
4034.6978	We must ask for maximum progress to be made in this field in a coherent manner - as indicated in Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado ' s excellent report - seeing reinforced cooperation as a last resort that would make it possible in all areas in which decisions are not taken by a qualified majority and also with regard to the CFSP and defence , for the permanence of the single institutional framework to be guaranteed , for a sufficient critical mass of countries to take part in it and , of course , for it to be open at all times .
35.2121	I hope the Treaty of Nice is achieved and seen to be a success and that closer cooperation is included as a welcome move in the direction of flexibility .
5.6491	Mr President , two brief observations regarding the reports on our agenda today .
7.0825	The Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues .
3.4065	Mr Gil-Robles ' proposals on reinforced cooperation are , on balance , positive .
8.3940	-LRB- Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the Committee responsible -RRB-
55.2319	If there is an equality of votes and if the honourable Member did vote , even though her machine did not work , then the procedure in any parliamentary assembly is that amendment falls .
237.0428	With regard to the passage on work experience in companies , apprenticeships , joint work/training contracts , it aims to make more widespread a practice already adopted by many States which consists , on the pretext on helping workers or unemployed young people , of making a partially or completely subsidised workforce available to employers .
25.1331	MacCormick report -LRB- A5-0304 / 2000 -RRB-
86.1504	Mr President , in the course of this discussion on the KlaÃ  report , I have been unable to comprehend why some people have persistently confused the terms ` genotype ' and ` genetic modification ' .
92.7366	As far as the definition of the clone is concerned , it is inadequate because , basically , the clone is a sub-division of the variety with special characteristics which have to be made known and the definition given does not cover this .
118.9836	With regard to company mergers , which the rapporteur hopes that the Commission will assess , such an assessment should describe not only the competitive advantages and the additional benefits that companies gain from them .
64.5879	Tomorrow I am not going to work , I will become a pensioner , because my country , Italy , has a system of early retirement .
245.7236	In fact , one can recall that 40 % grant aid is available for fixed investment costs for new businesses setting up within the Objective 1 region in Ireland .
9.3706	My final verdict is therefore positive .
35.1445	The intolerable situation being forced on workers by the choices made by large companies and the EU is already causing widespread reaction .
12.3326	Section VIII , Ombudsman
421.5880	When you then consider that the Commission would concentrate initially on cutting back the amounts outstanding in such a situation , which naturally we would also favour , there would , however , be far too great a risk of not being able to continue with a budgetary line deemed important by Parliament .
92.0920	We all know too , that it is no longer all that difficult for high-tech SMEs to acquire capital , because - and our initiative helped bring this about - the capital market situation of these companies has in fact improved considerably .
2372.4291	This is irrespective of the EUR 180 million we transferred last night for emergency aid , for the remainder of the year , because this money has come from the emergency reserve and is only to be used for humanitarian aid , i.e. to help the Serbs get through the winter during the last few months of the year .
131.0386	With a total of EUR 980 million , the European Parliament ' s budget , which I am submitting today , is the largest individual budget .
26.7857	We have made no change to the Council Budget , as per the agreement between Parliament and the Council .
58.1984	The Economic and Social Committee must get its own house in order if it wants to avoid jeopardising its continued existence for good .
62.6162	This corresponds , or rather , comes very close to what Parliament proposed during the previous budgetary procedure , i.e. EUR 196 million .
85.2980	In view of the decline in ECSC activities , and the conversion , it is debatable as to whether we can really still justify having an administrative budget of this size .
8.7151	We also asked the Council - with what success we do not know - to adopt a similar approach .
38.6794	This is a real record , which I hope will now lead to greater consideration of the financial constraints in our legislative activities .
149.1377	I would also like to emphasise the Council and Parliament ' s common objectives , which will in my opinion enable these two arms of the budgetary authority to arrive at an agreement .
968.5850	Within this category of expenditure , however , the Council has adjusted the balance in favour of the Cohesion Fund : giving the Cohesion Fund an extra EUR 360 million over and above the preliminary draft budget , which has been taken away from the Structural Fund , as a result of the implementation estimates submitted by the Member States .
40.7383	At this stage the Council does not see the revision of the financial perspective as being a prerequisite for financing reconstruction in the Balkans .
295.8900	I must point out that the Berlin Decisions would allow for a 6.1 % increase in payments as compared with the previous year , and no decision proposes an increase on that scale .
25.7427	If we want to improve - and that is our aim where the performance reserve is concerned - then of course we will need those posts .
4.8617	We also have the negative reserve instrument available to us in the course of the budgetary procedure .
14.2424	We also looked at the Court of Auditors ' special reports .
4.1711	I think this is a mistake which must be set right .
1906.4567	In fact , back at first reading , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens ' right to see their European laws upheld , and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law , on account of delays .
22.7273	Our citizens , not to mention this House , have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service .
1003.9081	I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , in trying to resolve some very difficult questions this year because of the immense pressures that have been brought to bear upon the budget at a very late stage .
61.0807	That is a pity ; it would be preferable if , in spending the budget , the actual objective were achieved , namely if the switch were made from countryside to multifunctionality and greater market orientation .
50.7561	Quality products must be highlighted , conservation standards , such as the observation of minimum fish sizes , must be circulated and we must explain to consumers the health benefits of eating fish .
9.4982	She sat in on our committee and , to her credit , took our committee ' s proposals into consideration .
2.9018	We can not and must not present the bill for this to the poorest countries .
74.4350	I would like to cite another amendment related to women ' s organisations : the committee approved an amount for the European Women ' s Lobby .
745.9884	In particular , this year we have asked - and I believe we will have the support of the House - to ensure that there is adequate money to see that we have a proper interactive database so that Members , staff and citizens can address their concerns and see how they are progressing through Parliament .
191.7984	We in Parliament should coordinate with the other two institutions on what we should be doing in terms of enlargement for translation , interpretation , buildings and personnel and we should work out a joint plan between us .
33.9751	As it turns out , the moderate face of conservatism has for the most part prevailed over the more ideological and unacceptable one .
110.7044	This is why we have called for a trialogue as soon as possible once this reading is complete , so that we can get down to the substance of the discussions .
8.2795	That is not our approach !
9.1873	We can approach this in two ways with these payments .
21.0640	It is right that the committee should have made a special point of focus the reduction in expenditure commitments that are in arrears .
6.0716	I must say that is how many people on the outside view the Council ' s policy .
0.2302	We are also critical of the decisions taken with regard to the LIFE programme .
1.6306	This is a blind alley , which my Group is not ready to go down .
209.3830	Mr President , when one hears Mr Wurtz ' s ornate , well-argued and well-considered reasoning , it is difficult not to agree with at least the underlying argument , if not the method he recommends .
21.1402	Mr President , one of the principles governing the budgetary process for 2001 is that of saving money .
35.7748	I also hope that the conditions attached to the establishment of 400 additional service posts within the Commission will actually be fulfilled .
197.1111	With a view to resolving current bottlenecks , a general reserve should be created under category 4 - a performance reserve - which will be used in proportion to the extent to which the various items are implemented .
4.6787	Kosovo , of course - which we had the problem with last year .
603.9410	My real worry is that , when the Commission and the World Bank come back with their report at the end of November or beginning of December , it will just be written off by the Council .
5.3170	That is something for which we should always be thankful .
7.4400	This is not some sort of Directory .
14.4813	As they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together .
1331.8830	Following the international meeting on the Colombian peace process , held in Madrid on 6 and 7 July 2000 , attended by Mr Solana , the representative of the 15 Member States and the Commission , the European Union is currently looking into practical opportunities for cooperation with Colombia .
35.0908	This is the problem , in addition , in many cases , to the actions of the paramilitaries , who force the peasant-farmers to move by means of indiscriminate killings .
116.8555	It is the duty of the President of the sitting to guide and interpret the questions and it is then at the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council how to discuss or respond to them , except where the questions are nonsensical or have nothing to do with the subject .
3.0513	It is just that I am trying not to indulge in demagoguery .
1584.2814	Would the Council be willing to consider establishing a ` Tobin area ' at European Union level , i.e. imposing a Tobin tax on Europe ' s financial markets , which account for 50 % of world currency-exchange transactions ?
45.7760	Firstly , I think everyone recognises that this tax , known as Tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level .
14.4919	Indeed we hope that this will prove to be one of the main practical achievements of this Presidency .
11.9392	The thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount can not have a deterrent effect on speculation .
7.6141	Firstly , will he come and speak to us as a militant on a future occasion ?
6.8463	I do agree with you , however , we could be discussing this for a long time to come .
5.7825	The Council has not received any Commission proposal on compensation for farmers .
21.5205	As usual , however , I can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us .
390.6026	Regarding international traffic in transit , international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , stipulates , subject to certain reservations , that the vessels of all states have the ` right of innocent passage ' in territorial waters .
260.4389	Finally , I also endorse the observation made in the Haug resolution that we need to pay bills on time as soon as possible , because the Commission will not come out smelling of roses if this situation continues for much longer .
447.5049	I would like to focus attention on the fact that there seem to be sufficient amounts of European Union money for financing political parties at European level , but not , for example , for the prevention of unemployment .
447.6817	Mr President , in the Haug report the sentiment is expressed that the Commission , in close cooperation with Parliament , is responsible for providing information to the European citizen about the policies of the European Union .
65.2588	The efforts of the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , to incorporate the suggestions of our Group on that subject deserve a great deal of gratitude .
17.8731	There are three major issues which we should be concerned about in relation to the budget for other institutions .
4.4415	Real savings can only be made if the institutions work together .
60.3644	That is the sort of question we must ask ourselves when we study the Budget , for it is of course questions of this kind that our voters will quite rightly be asking .
10.8600	Another area I wanted to address is that of agricultural policy , where most of the savings have been made .
108.0202	A point not always made is that this sizeable budget provision is not just confined to support for farmers but is also a factor in the provision of cheap food for European citizens .
235.8030	I was able to experience this first-hand over the past two weeks when , during a trip in the Western Balkans , I visited Kosovo and Bosnia .
27.2802	The damage in the Balkans needs to be restored , but it should be paid by for those who were responsible for it .
6.0788	With these funds , we could show that Europe is the real partner in this region .
13.9281	I think that this distorts the legislative procedure for adopting programmes and , above all , the content of those programmes .
95.1007	In the same way , we need a careful analysis on the part of the Commission of how , in the course of the enlargement process , European administration is to be developed .
366.8566	Mr President , unlike Mr Bourlanges , I am not frustrated by this procedure but I must say that this must be the most mind-numbing budget I have known in the Committee on Budgets for years .
235.8029	The increase is inexplicably high in category 1 , that is to say the EU ' s comprehensive agricultural policy about which the Council of Ministers has the last word .
168.1789	A sector such as steel , thanks to technological research and development , has ceased to be an industry that only generates basic products and has become one that puts semi-processed products on the market with added value .
219.3843	During my time in the House of Commons not once do I recall any debate about the EDF budget and I doubt whether there is any debate in the Member States about the EDF budget .
5.1596	This is what I am asking you to do , and I am asking you to vote accordingly .
375.3582	I also have to make it very clear that we now have a fledgling new regional government in Northern Ireland of which my party leader , David Trimble , is the First Minister .
1004.8386	Therefore , a rule laying down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning him , which must be processed fairly for specific purposes on the basis of the consent of the person concerned and subject to control by an independent authority , has been included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
1.7290	Mr President , the protection of personal privacy is a fundamental human right .
4.5396	Data protection on the telecommunications network ought also to be reviewed .
47.4097	The scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar , i.e. to Article 286 .
46.7897	This would increase the channels for protecting the citizens - an extremely important element - but also make it easier for them to act , to be active and to interact with the institutions .
116.6466	Amendment Nos 55 , 56 and 59 differ from the Council text , but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency .
52.4246	Amendment No 69 would seem to be acceptable to the Commission inasmuch as the wording does not entail a challenge to its right of initiative .
222.4964	The report published by the European Commission on 14 March 2000 is not , strictly speaking , a response to the demands of national and regional authorities in the outermost regions .
2602.9319	Moreover , there is an urgent need to initiate an analysis of the impact of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement , signed in June 2000 in Cotonou , and other international trade agreements with a view to assessing their repercussions for the outermost regions and drawing up measures to compensate producers in those regions liable to face additional competition which they are unable to withstand .
33.1968	Nonetheless , it illustrates what I believe is a much more widespread problem about the relationship between reports and opinions , particularly those of a non-legislative kind .
122.6980	For those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions , this is a very negative view , and , of course , a deeply mistaken one .
20.0185	In our view these measures need to go beyond regional development policies , because our shortfalls and handicaps are structural , not temporary .
228.4935	Indeed I am convinced that the young people of our regions can actually glimpse a way out of the tragic unemployment which so drives them to despair , if we do manage to shift from a basically financial strategy , necessary , admittedly , but inadequate , to a more comprehensive strategy based on real recognition of our unique characteristics .
11.2874	The economic development of the regions must be supported through , for example , various direct and indirect taxation solutions .
275.2383	The experience of almost a decade and the new challenges created by developments in the common agricultural policy suggest that these programmes should be revised in order to sustain the ability of these regions to survive in the new climate of competition .
10.1189	We want to continue to be an area - or areas , in this case - that requires specific treatment .
62.7336	This , ladies and gentlemen , means that we , that is , you and I , must find a balance between complying with general regulation and adapting policy to the specific needs of the outermost regions .
110.7919	In Feira , we reported back on the progress of work and we shall , of course , do the same at the European Council in Nice .
1.5774	The Commission is also paying great attention to a number of other issues .
16.6019	Thank you very much , Commissioner Barnier .
598.2617	It has occurred to me overnight that if the result of a vote is declared and there is within the Rules no provision for the issue to be reopened at all , given the alarming frequency with which a whole range of machines do not work , this could create serious difficulties .
318.2176	If I had known that the total number of abstentions and votes against was going to be greater than the number of votes in favour of Mr Evans ' report , I would have asked my Group to vote against that report and it would not have been adopted .
9.7838	New action is needed .
0.2557	We must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled .
5.3234	Strict requirements and effective control are indispensable , but competition should be kept clean in the process .
25.1941	The second principle is that it is important for this Agency to be highly independent and we must guarantee that independence .
48.7409	I will mention briefly the key amendments which I commend to the House and the Commissioner and which I hope we can see voted through today .
20.9381	Mr President , Mr Bowis has done an extraordinary job as rapporteur on this major and complicated issue .
50.2579	This means that all inspectorates must work together well and , often , insufficient attention is paid to the inspectorates which inspect animal medicines ; this is the pharmaceutical inspectorate in my country .
221.5957	The best case scenario is that it will work alongside the Environmental Agency , which does an excellent information job , but which freely admits that the environmental situation in Europe has not improved .
5.7944	Lastly , we must beware of standardising our food cultures .
7.9391	Risk assessment must start where the problems starts .
26.5162	This principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of EU legislation on food labelling is carried out .
29.3002	If we do not manage to modernise the early warning system and make it work , then there is little point in worrying about much else .
57.0324	We are now hoping for Parliament ' s support , and we hope that the Council and the Commission will accept our proposals .
57.6980	Mr President , the sheer number of food scandals and the debate about using genetic engineering in food production have undermined the present food safety system .
0.2310	How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act .
359.5605	The establishment of an independent , high profile European Food Safety Agency is a substantial step which satisfies the need of all the citizens for guarantees on the quality and safety of food products .
5.8694	I will not dwell on the heart of the matter , since we are all agreed on that .
114.4141	However , having said that , I believe it is to the credit of this Parliament and Commissioner Byrne that food safety now dominates the European agenda .
9.3748	It also has symbolic meaning .
65.4465	But I also understand that the many crises in Europe , and I also refer to my own country , have shown that we mainly need something to hold on to .
41.8763	The agency must be located somewhere well-connected in terms of transport and information technology , and the area in question should have a good reputation in the area of food safety .
8.3952	I would also like to thank Commissioner Byrne for his cooperation .
26.8174	Consumers are quite right to demand food which poses absolutely no threat to their health and the quality of which meets certain criteria and specifications .
177.8804	On a final note , President Prodi created huge expectations in the run-up to his presidency , and Commissioner Byrne and rapporteur Bowis were asked to flesh these out in their White Paper .
81.8064	The limited quantity of food we still allow ourselves must first and foremost be healthy , taste good and be produced in an environmentally sound way in consumers ' eyes .
0.2600	The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option .
55.5781	It is driven by the desperate need to persuade a sceptical public that the European institutions are delivering something - anything - of value .
7.8886	There are many doubts and critical voices .
1835.3490	Therefore , any legislative measure concerning a sector such as the food sector , which is one of the driving forces of European industry - accounting for 15 % of the total output of the manufacturing sector and employing 2.5 million workers - must be evaluated on the basis of this twin consideration , since both principles are intended to guarantee the general well-being of the Community .
7.6032	Amendments have been tabled to that effect .
13.8347	In this regard , the Commission will adopt proposals for a revised control regime in the period ahead .
340.0682	I have previously acknowledged in Parliament and other forums what I regard as an important issue for the fullest acceptance of our ideas for a food authority : the role and involvement of Parliament itself in enacting the legislation establishing the food authority .
294.3121	This was one of the most rapid agreements to be signed in the history of international agreements : it is the only agreement to have been ratified within a year by forty parliaments , thus becoming operative .
92.0435	Mr President , even in common parlance the word ` mine ' indicates danger , and if an Italian describes someone as ` una mina ' they are calling that person a loose canon .
234.6183	But of course its authority in this field will be greater if the Council and the Member States explicitly state that the European Union will under no circumstances in its external relations use anti-personnel landmines or help in their use .
0.2437	But they also often destroy countries ' long-term development potential by contaminating entire regions .
260.5263	It is the challenge of implementing that Convention to the full which led the Commission to reflect on how to reinforce the contribution of the European Union to the battle against landmines .
93.0462	Clearly , the granting of European Union mine-action support can work as an important lever to get potential beneficiary countries to sign up to the Convention .
26.5404	Instead , we are proposing to set up an expert group with participation from Member States , from non-governmental organisations and from the other relevant players .
26.0904	Therefore the Commission can not accept Amendments Nos 8 , 22 , 23 , 25 and 29 .
103.6293	The anti-personnel landmine campaign should not be used as an opportunity to attack western governments , particularly the United States , western military establishments , or western industry .
95.2140	The Commission communication and the regulation on anti-personnel landmines are very useful documents , but they omit two key elements , which Parliament 's amendments seek to correct .
159.9274	We do not want more bureaucracy or comitology ; instead we want to create more room for you , we want things to be done efficiently , and I believe that our priorities in this respect are not a million miles apart .
6.1230	That is a mistake this Parliament is constantly making .
48.9142	When , for example , a country feels insecure along its border with another country , its government will take recourse , wrongly of course , to the easy option of a minefield .
5.5565	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I strongly support the Community 's initiative against anti-personnel mines .
69.5678	The European Union is often the most important contributor to financing de-mining actions , and international actions are carried out in the relevant countries .
154.3887	Since various comments have been made , I would like to specify that although the Minister is not present , the Council is represented by senior civil servants , who will of course pass our words on to him .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
23.2397	I would briefly like to comment on one point , and this concerns our amendment to the motion for a resolution .
1.4827	I know there are still differences of opinion on this or that amendment .
1.6590	The history we share with our neighbour has often been full of anguish .
277.3790	Experts from Finland and Finnish clearance vehicles have taken part in clearance programmes in Cambodia for two and a half years , and in Mozambique and Kosovo for one year .
10.3187	-LRB- Interruption by the President to request silence -RRB-
309.7859	If Mrs Van Lancker ' s proposals are adopted we shall definitely be stepping back light years in terms of our ability to achieve the important , ambitious and indispensable aims of Lisbon .
35.1998	The Commission must not be prevented from using its right of initiative in those areas in which it has the power to act and to propose compulsory instruments .
1.7859	It can not arbitrarily be transferred to other areas , as specific procedures are needed .
39.3315	As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the only reason the meeting of Heads of State and Government signed it was in order to be seen to make a statement .
103.8364	I voted for this resolution because in it Parliament wisely does not opt for the ` imperialist ' theses of the large , populous European countries against the self-affirmation of the others .
71.2097	The resolution contains good sections on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Middle East and the EPLP supports the resolution overall .
116.3206	I am sure that pensioners and elderly people feel that Europe represents a future of peace , and we therefore support any step , however small , in that direction .
125.7824	We believe that the basis for cooperation in the EU should continue to be unanimity on the basic questions concerning the legal base on which the EU is founded .
78.1672	The Portuguese socialist MEPs do not , however , agree that ratification of this ` Constitution ' should necessarily be carried out by means of a referendum .
5.6865	In the name of the democratic Europe we want to build , we reject the report .
8.2855	But a constitution is something else entirely .
0.4180	A future Constitution could set out in a clear and -LRB- relatively -RRB- concise way
83.8831	We have a constitution already in the form of the Treaties , in so far as they lay down the competences of the Union , its procedures and the composition and powers of its institutions .
369.1094	If , tomorrow , the Union wishes to embrace Europe in its entirety , the geographical Europe , extending even beyond the next wave of enlargement , it will need institutions that are fully mature in political and democratic terms .
126.0868	The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards ` ever closer union ' without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves .
128.3446	These proposals are not acceptable ; the need for cooperation within Europe is genuine , but also diverse and multiform , and it can no longer be locked into a uniform Community framework based on majority voting .
516.3521	We must point out that reinforced cooperation , as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam , must in particular concern an area that does not come within the Community ' s exclusive purview , must be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union , must respect the principles of the Treaties and must be used only as a last resort while concerning a majority of Member States .
133.1742	Once again , if poorer and smaller countries of the European Union could not reform their economic structures they would not be able to meet the economic convergence criterion as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty .
206.4780	That is why I am in favour of a minimum number of rules and limitations affecting reinforced cooperation between neighbours , as long as such cooperation is not intended to disadvantage third parties .
19.8333	On the other hand , we welcome the paragraphs in the report on promoting renewable energies and monitoring industrial activities which cause pollution .
65.6107	Most especially , this has resulted in the planned destruction of our banana industry , in Guadeloupe , Martinique , Madeira and the Canaries .
15.5411	On the other hand , we have serious doubts as to whether or not former colonies should be declared outermost regions .
9.3965	That independence also implies financial independence .
144.0502	This first step must not close our eyes to the serious work that still needs to be done on risk management , developing and improving the Rapid Alert System , but also on ensuring traceability and public information .
11.0555	Nor should the Commission appoint the scientific experts , even following what appears to be a rigorous selection procedure .
302.8352	So today we need to correct the adverse effects on public health of a policy very largely inspired by the Commission , as Mrs Thomas-Mauro quite rightly pointed out this morning .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. -RRB-
456.7343	Madam President , I would point out though that we still have not received an answer to one question , namely whether the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is prepared to withdraw its amendments .
10.5604	So , we have an additional 1.3 million for the Medicines Agency .
39.0197	Either this is a way of pursuing Liberal politics , where the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing , or there is a lack of coordination .
21.6680	Section I , European Parliament
21.8406	Before the vote on Amendment No 60
19.1503	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
101.1409	Contributions that are relatively minor for our richest countries could have a strategic role for peace and development in those regions , yet the choice has been to make significant cuts , which looks like a dangerous policy of burying our heads in the sand .
135.2776	No one in the European Parliament would support discrimination or violence against women ; we must remember that to deny women a voice is a form of violence against them .
2046.9008	Secondly : because the new items for the reconstruction of Yugoslavia - which we need and which should be more substantial - have been found by slashing items for food relief , agriculture , social spending , etc. , rather than by increasing the budget , which is what the Member States of the European Union should have done , given that they perpetrated and aided and abetted the destruction of the former Yugoslavia .
250.8171	The review of the Financial Perspectives that Parliament has been demanding for some time in order to honour new commitments in the Balkan region , including Serbia , also continues to cast its shadow on proceedings .
31.5686	RÃ 1/4 hle Report -LRB- A5-0251 / 2000 -RRB-
35.6747	As well as the new constraints imposed on staff , particularly in the commercial services sector , inequality in the treatment of users is going to get worse .
10.4290	Madam President , in this case , too , it was with deep regret that I had to vote against .
121.9313	The proposals for fruit and vegetables are part of the more general , anti-farming direction which the EU is taking , now that it has decided to persecute farmers .
104.2540	The present report puts forward amendments on a range of points that address the interests of European production in general and of Portuguese production in particular .
39.5415	Personally , as the representative of the Pensioners Party , I am concerned at the situation of the elderly in these countries .
168.0663	The Commission communication should have been entitled differently , given that it contains no specific policies or measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ; on the contrary , it confines itself , as the rapporteur rightly comments , to merely producing an organisation chart and a vague list of common policies and measures .
25.5758	The boom in the cheap transport of goods by road mainly leads to the polluting industry being relocated from the richer to the poorer countries .
74.6840	The draft resolution proposes to ratify the establishment of such a system , when ` the technical and legal aspects have not yet been investigated ' and ` the functioning and effectiveness of the system must be tested ' .
5.2823	That does not detract from the fact that I am delighted with the interest in this topic .
203.4265	Similarly , we need to activate the principle of prevention contained in Article 130Ã ` of the EU Treaty -LRB- in order to control and withdraw known or suspected endocrine disrupters and develop alternative harmless substances -RRB- .
23.5462	In my report , I have listed systems such as IBAN , SWIFT , STEP 1 and IPI .
20.0022	A very costly matter indeed which will be rendered completely redundant in one market with one currency .
74.6436	But in order to grant banks absolute certainty and clarity in their heavy investment programmes , I am expecting the Commission to change the directive by return of post .
482.2604	There is even talk of it being possible to reduce costs by 90 % , although the financial services institutions impress on us time and again that the higher costs are linked to processing the transfers and not to the technicalities of making cross-border payments .
72.4181	The European Commission does not have the right to set the level of bank charges , but it can use its influence to bring down transfer fees .
126.4264	The idea that transfers in two participating euro area countries will no longer be considered as an international transaction incurring international costs but as a national transfer , will need to become universally accepted .
33.5823	This is not some fiendish ploy by the bankers , just a technical reality temporarily resisting resolution , but bound to evolve in the right direction in time .
125.4068	So now we are facing the consequences of the hard sell of the euro , and that brings me to a conclusion on this issue of cross-border payments , but also , Madam President , on the euro generally .
850.6542	Although we in the European Parliament now criticise the banks we have to understand that cross-border payments account for only a six-percent slice of all payment transactions , so development of this area is an expensive investment in the eyes of the banks in relation to the benefits gained , from the point of view of the banks at least .
25.6993	For me , the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either .
148.5750	That date must be considered as an extremely important and symbolic milestone in the construction of the European Union - and I am also addressing Mrs Villiers with this observation .
0.4832	It is , of course , our aim to increase this to 100 % .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. -RRB-
19.9158	Next , we should take care not to make access to capital for firms , especially the smallest ones , even more complicated .
5.4039	To this end it wishes to introduce a benchmarking exercise , which is certainly an interesting initiative .
24.6693	She has identified the points where there was a lack of clarity or significant slippage between statements and reality in the Commission ' s text .
224.1592	In our Union , this should in the first instance translate into simplification of customs formalities , because the fiscal , social , administrative and regulatory disparities between the Member States in terms of costs constitute a substantial barrier to equal access to the internal market .
3221.6042	Secondly , and without going through the measures set out in the report , which are , anyway , the result of an assessment made last year , you will note , all the same , that we are taking up the same old essential points : simplification of the assistance formalities , which are still too cumbersome , and even stifling for SMIs ; help with finance and risk capital to ensure greater stability ; aid for research into new technologies ; establishment of a European standard through the BEST process ; aid with communication and information .
16.5810	But STOA is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject .
68.9385	Another of Mrs Montfort ' s key points is the improvement , or rather simplification , of legislation and the regulatory structure in the Member States .
236.3880	For small companies , the three or six months which they have to wait for a piece of information to be forthcoming or for a programme to start is an endlessly long time .
353.8918	Furthermore , we must in practice set aside specific and ring-fenced amounts , under European Union actions , for small and medium-sized businesses , within the ambit of all those activities relating to research , innovation , the e-Europe project and so forth .
24.6980	Mr President , we need to highlight the priority which the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship gives to small and medium-sized businesses .
23.0554	This is something that the Committee on Industry needs to do on a regular basis from now on .
11.2205	Many amendments refer to micro-enterprises-enterprises and crafts .
22.9792	We are currently improving our advice structure so as to be able to remain in constant contact with these contributors .
259.8982	Obviously cooperation with third countries may help eradicate the causes of waves of refugees and migrants but this does not mean that endeavours in this direction release the Union from its international obligation to protect those in need or to provide help to combat the causes of migration .
50.5008	Finally , I should like to state that I support the preparatory work to conclude a stability and partnership agreement between the Union and Albania .
26.4360	On the other hand , positive efforts are being made to drive forward the democratisation process and to develop society , which we must and will support .
1101.6565	It would , therefore , be valuable for the programme that we have before us , and which I feel Mrs Karamanou covers very well in her report , to be subdivided into measures that can be implemented swiftly , medium-term measures and those regarding a legacy of history that we have been combating for 500 years and which will persist for centuries to come .
12.6153	Our forefathers went to the United States to create a life in freedom , as they believed .
14.6915	There is also the threat that they will be picked up again by the traffickers and returned to the countries of destination .
9.5664	I think that we need to turn our attention to two - of many - basic issues .
8.9287	This is an ill-advised policy .
3.4589	It will be a long but necessary process to bring about reconciliation between the national groups .
57.0329	I welcome the fact that the report at last takes into account and develops two points to which we Italians attach great importance .
3.3373	Precisely in the case of Albania we see that it can affect any Member State .
4.1231	The Commission is playing an active part in compiling the report .
6.1184	You will remember the provisions recently presented to us on climbing ladders .
171.2057	Mr President , may I first , on behalf of my group , congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report , which certainly gives a very good , consistent and comprehensive picture of the situation as he sees it .
1600.3325	All too often , however , we are forced to conclude that this European legislation is packaged in a language which is too technical , too legal and too complex , so much so that this European legislation becomes unusable , as a result of which the intended goal , namely to make legislation in the European Union transparent and unambiguous , is not achieved .
116.5106	For 2000 years or more people have been safely drinking the water from the burns -LRB- the little rivers -RRB- , and now they are prohibited from doing so .
69.8130	A text like that needs revision when it no longer responds to its initial objective and has become out of date and inappropriate , otherwise it will be a source of disputes as harmful as they are unpopular .
1840.8081	I should like to recall that in the seventeenth century a great Dutch lawyer , Hugo Groot , better known as Grotius , one of the founders of international law , warned theologians to stay out of legal matters with that famous phrase , ` Silete , theologi , in munere alieno . '
65.6571	Mr President , the truth is that with this report and a few opinions something has occurred that reveals how complicated it can be to legislate or even just deal with reports in this Parliament .
105.3122	Nevertheless I believe we have to insist that as it is in the Treaty it is a principle that can stand before the Court of Justice .
7.9401	This must be respected and taken into consideration by EU legislators .
314.2967	I hope that this report , which we Commissioners were given last year , will in future include subsidiarity , better regulation and assessment of alternatives , while respecting the legislative authority of the Council and Parliament .
15.8187	Since 1 January 1999 , exchange rates have been irrevocably fixed .
142.1603	For the people living in our countries , the borders are simply maintained , even if the countries pass many of their powers to the European Union , and national banks merge across the borders .
10.0163	This is therefore doubly serious .
62.5830	I repeat , it would be a pity to dash so much hope for the future and so many possibilities for mutual understanding .
8.0379	The Commission is optimistic that it will be possible to establish a balanced partnership with Morocco .
11.1950	I think we banged our fists on enough tables last year and should proceed with caution .
335.6064	The Commission sent signals , not to the negotiators of the neighbouring country , but to European fishermen : too many cephalopod trawlers , a fleet with excess capacity , mixed enterprises , the need to negotiate by segments of the fleet , a ban on mentioning other types of trade and , of course , silence .
5.3581	The negotiations concerning a new agreement between the EU and Morocco have made slow progress .
64.8382	I find it odd that boats fishing in terms of the EU ' s quota are able to land their catches in an occupied country .
69.0148	Champions of generosity and of the third world , they are discovering what Chairman Mao called ` the difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions ' .
2839.7486	At least , that is what we can hope for at the moment , and from this alone we can be confident that fisheries relations with Morocco will be re-established as soon as possible and in the best possible conditions for both parties , because a fisheries scenario for southern Europe is unthinkable without satisfactory relations between both sides of the Mediterranean , while the needless sacrificing of a fleet that has contributed so much to the development of fishing in Morocco is unthinkable too .
710.9488	I believe that this fact should be noted and made clear and doubts raised as to whether the Commission is capable of negotiating international agreements , especially having heard President Prodi request an international remit for the Commission .
3801.2790	However , after a wasted year , and at a time when we are trying to put budgetary appropriations that were earmarked for the agreement under other headings , I must also express my deep suspicion about the Commission 's commitment to protecting the legitimate interests of the shipowners and fishermen affected , and state my scepticism about the real will of the Union and of many Member States , amongst them Spain , to negotiate the agreement in the `` general field of political and economic relations between Morocco and the European Union '' as we propose in the resolution .
442.8263	It should also be pointed out at this juncture that the fishing agreement with Morocco is part of a broader partnership and cooperation framework under which the European Union also grants Morocco considerable trade concessions and considerable support for its development .
45.8701	The Union must prepare a programme for conversion of activities carried out by the operators affected , in order to give them a stable future .
682.8654	Mr President , a Czech bishop , Bishop Koukl , to whom I am very close , has a rather nice saying : `` Loving thy neighbour would be so simple if only one ' s neighbour were not right on one ' s doorstep '' .
151.4155	However , I should like expressly to criticise the anti-Moroccan undertones that have also been heard in this debate because they do nothing to help neighbourly relations and because they do nothing to help the fisheries agreement .
398.1621	As regards the appropriate measures to be taken if the agreement does not succeed , the Commission is bearing these in mind but , as you well understand , we think and we hope that it will be possible for the negotiations to move forward on Monday in a more decisive way .
1.2447	Mr Wieland has five minutes ' speaking time on behalf of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi .
7.6287	I consider this action to be dubious .
40.2876	It is our view that freedom of movement enables European citizens not to be the victims of discrimination under national systems of law .
234.0130	Otherwise , this problem , which is political , not legal in nature , will arise again and could occur in other States of the European Union where laws governing university career paths and education are different from elsewhere .
9.2897	We have to ask why .
623.8076	That is a critical point because the Ombudsman said that the Commission acted wrongly in failing to communicate with the language lettori the fact that they were changing pleadings on an important and significant article , and the article on which the Commission changed its pleadings is the very point that Commissioner Busquin mentioned .
31.7334	Governments must understand that if they sign treaties then they must either abrogate them as sovereign states or abide by their terms in a rule of law .
62.1685	The diversity of cultures , which we see as a fundamental element of Europe , finds expression first and foremost in the diversity of languages .
104.2268	The Commission did its job in bringing the infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and the Italian State changed the law .
5.5788	In my country , for secondary school teachers we have very strict and very hard recruitment competitions .
10.8472	I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 27 October 2000 .
833.8841	The burning inferno on the funicular railway - a railway which was considered to be one of the safest - which leads to one of the most beautiful areas of the Austrian Alps , makes everything else fade into the background , and the readiness to share pain and grief becomes our only comfort .
118.0433	Since we were not given sufficient notice , it would make more sense to wait for the legislative proposals and only then have Parliament deal with this point so that we do justice to the problem .
181.7345	In order to group together the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council , who has an extremely busy schedule , I propose that the statement by the Commission be inserted at the end of the joint debate on aid for reconstruction .
431.6880	If the European People ' s Party is proposing that at the next part-session we should support having this question taken up , we may consider it ; if it is just a delaying tactic , we will be against it .
521.0583	I would appreciate it if points of order really were points of order , and I would be grateful if you could begin by indicating , as , moreover , is stipulated in the Rules of Procedure , the rule on which each point of order is based .
107.7431	It is also contrary to Directive 99/62/EC which provides , and I quote , `` that tolls and user charges may not discriminate directly or indirectly on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier , nor the origin or destination of the vehicle '' .
12.6024	Mutual assistance in criminal matters
124.5657	The Republic of Portugal presented a draft Protocol amending Article 2 of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office , Europol .
19.0122	This contradiction conflicts with democratic values , particularly in regard to human rights , and especially in the field of data protection .
274.7891	By virtue of Article 2 of the draft Convention , the Member States can no longer decline to conduct searches or seize items by invoking the reservations set out in Article 5 of the Convention of 1959 .
236.5101	I am therefore very grateful for the compromise formulation in the Roure report which was drafted here in committee , which has simply made it clear that this traditional protection of fundamental rights must continue to be guaranteed .
1784.2768	We agree that there is an express and urgent need for effective judicial cooperation , but , at the same time , denounce a shift that contains the seeds of a Europol set up outside the control of Parliament or of any legal authority , and , in more general terms , a democratic deficit in a Europe that the Member States insist in confining to the misty realms of intergovernmental procedures , thus skirting the obligations , duties and control that derive from universal suffrage .
32.2910	Political unification , political control may be what we need to resolve these questions and , by extension , the reviews and harmonisation of the laws governing these issues .
1.8027	That is the main focus of the cross-party amendments which the Committee is putting forward .
416.5226	I should very much like to hear the Commissioner ' s reaction to the idea that when we hopefully get the concept of enhanced cooperation accepted at the Nice Summit next month that we create a European FBI .
15.0461	However , this raises two important questions .
1018.6167	At some moment , we will have to compile all these texts because , Mr President , you and , doubtless , all of us here know that for this to be implemented by judges - who are the ones that have to implement it while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial - with this scattered system we are , of course , very poorly guided .
8.9634	All of this illegally acquired money is , however , laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy .
882.3718	To this end , the Marinho report proposes that a guarantee should be given that specific measures will be adopted to trace , freeze , seize and confiscate the proceeds from crime , requiring a joint mobilisation of police and judicial resources in order to ensure that criminals or the proceeds from crime can find no hiding place in the European Union .
317.7073	The Bar Association has final and binding authority on issues of professional confidentiality and it falls to that body to decide whether or not to authorise - in exceptional cases - the disclosure of information at the request of the courts .
108.1125	The Karamanou report , on which I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur , proposes various amendments with regard to improving the democratic and judicial control of Europol .
1.6234	The perpetrators are ruthless and know nothing of borders , restrictions or rules .
147.1266	If the Council , the Commission and Parliament act in unison , the end result will be considerable added value in terms of law and security for the people of Europe .
32.6866	Well , as you know , the issue of competence and the limits on this competence are central to this Community harmonisation aimed at improving the justice system .
1569.9198	I omit the word ` freedom ' in consideration of the attitude of the Council and the Member States - I repeat , of the Council and the Member States - in strengthening Europe ' s repressive framework , aided and abetted by Parliament which , lacking the due dignity of an institution elected by the citizens , is willing to endorse these proposals .
0.1937	For both these reasons , my own group can not be expected to cooperate .
11.3865	I would congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on a good piece of work .
6690.6698	It has to be said that either we subscribe to the democratic model with which we are familiar , one based on the division of powers , and one which recognises that the courts have supreme authority when it comes to guaranteeing individual rights , and we acknowledge that European judicial cooperation in criminal matters consists precisely of reinforcing coordination between European courts in their capacity of protectors of fundamental rights - and this is the model to which I personally subscribe - or we can choose not to subscribe to this model and , in that case , I fail to understand how one can see this initiative for developing a common judicial area as posing any threat to guarantees on fundamental rights .
251.4184	That means that investigations and criminal proceedings that can count on the involvement of Europol must be flanked and followed up by Eurojust , acting as a network of judges and public prosecutors at European level .
45.4972	I mentioned that the FAIR Programme investigated in the Court of Auditors ' special report was unfinished business from the past .
75.2252	In addition , there were mistakes in the certified expenditure and insufficient sanctions , as well as links between experts and some of the organisations involved in the research proposals which , in my view , need to be queried .
17.4521	It is too long a delay and undermines the relevance of Parliament ' s work in considering such reports .
203.8266	With the help of the scientific research which is , of course , an important part of our policies - in this case , fisheries policy - a prior assessment needs to be carried out of what is wanted and of how the resources are used , so that existing resources can continually be adapted to catch techniques and catch opportunities .
473.2759	It had come to an end by the time I took up my duties as Commissioner , but it is the responsibility of the present Commission , and my responsibility as Commissioner , to ensure that the lessons learned from your work are turned to good account and to respond to the Court of Auditors ' recommendations on this issue .
3626.2445	With regard to the annual monitoring of research programmes , which provides an independent opinion on the stage reached in , and the quality of , the implementation of our programmes , we have developed several measures aimed at improvement : an analysis of research management practices within the context of national and European Union programmes , with a view to exchanges of good practices and the promotion of mutual learning ; the financing of studies aimed at assessing the socio-economic impact of the framework programme and the launching of pilot schemes aimed at evaluating the impact of completed projects , as you have , moreover , just emphasised in speaking of the need to gauge this impact .
355.1373	I can tell you , in this respect , that the Commission ' s services have done everything within their power to recover the amounts in question , but the services responsible embarked on the appropriate legal procedures two years ago .
21.6034	The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
12.2910	Charter of Fundamental Rights
540.2484	I think that is reason enough for us to adopt this Charter , even though there are points at which it may be hard to accept that many rights , many basic rights which Parliament demanded for the people of Europe , and with good cause , have been left out of the Charter .
33.2419	For all that , however , today ' s debate , in my opinion , is a far cry from being needless repetition .
168.0191	The Charter is primarily - and this is rare enough to be worthy of note , as I have seen particularly in the preparations for the IGC - a clear and well-organised document .
208.1995	These are criticisms put forward in a recently launched appeal from some Members of Parliament , especially Members of the European Parliament , calling for the Charter to be revised .
46.3539	The balance arrived at by the authors has met with general approval , and the Presidency has no desire to reopen the debate , no more than , I believe , your rapporteurs do .
150.6404	Allow me at this point to offer my warmest thanks and acknowledgement to those who represented us at the convention under the leadership of our fellow member , Mr MÃ © ndez de Vigo .
665.1744	In saying yes , we are instructing you , Madam President , to proclaim the Charter with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at the EU summit in Nice in a few weeks ' time .
3.6013	After Nice we will be able to start talking about the European constitution .
143.6121	Transparency was no substitute , however , for the democratic deficit , as the NGOs were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration .
4.7124	It is not just our rights and our freedoms but our democracy which is at stake here .
721.5478	In fact , if it were possible to amend the Charter , if it were admitted that the Charter does not provide for duties and does not provide fully for rights , things would be easier : the Charter does not go far enough in protecting the natural family or safeguarding children ; it disregards the need for rules to regulate every new global information technology ; it discriminates between private and public education ; with regard to safeguarding the environment , it disregards the protection of health and animal rights ; it is too general with regard to consumer protection and leaves the door open to the marketing of extremely harmful foodstuffs .
5.4059	Whether we vote for this Charter , against it , or abstain altogether , nothing will change .
100.7038	Many new rights for children , the elderly and the disabled are mentioned , together - and I find this most interesting - with a new freedom to conduct a business which is almost tantamount to a sort of ban on socialism .
40.1491	Some say it was a balanced mandate , others that it was inadequate , but it was a mandate whose dynamic force we used to the full , and even almost exceeded .
34.2212	Access to a more open administration is one of the most practical improvements the Charter can offer our EU citizens .
36.0888	Perhaps the best we can do for the time being is get it mentioned in Article 6 but that will only be for starters .
34.6081	Finally , in spite of the innovative approach of the Convention method , which I have mentioned , things must be stated openly .
268.2175	I therefore think , and I am addressing my remarks to the Council Presidency in particular at this point , that if the governments meeting in Nice adopt the Charter as a political declaration , they should preface it with some introductory note to the effect that defining and developing citizens ' rights lies , in all instances , within the exclusive remit of the national parliaments .
87.8330	Apart from the substantive problems already raised today , merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments .
3.2230	Mr President , allow me to say a few words on the effects of the Charter .
127.1845	Firstly , to say to the citizens : Europe is not simply something that happens to you , it is a community that gives you rights , that gives you guarantees , that gives you protection in certain circumstances .
110.4044	The divide between those who have much and those who have little or nothing is growing ever wider , while , precisely in the name of these sacred principles , those who have much are exacting increasing sacrifices from those who have little or nothing .
14.2543	In fact the bulk of the people in the United Kingdom are wholly opposed to further integration .
18.2149	I believe the court should particularly allow itself to be influenced by those paragraphs concerning freedom of trade , entrepreneurship and copyright .
543.6802	What , for me , was the deciding factor was an appeal from Europe ' s fastest growing progressive democratic movement , the French Attaque , which characterises the Charter as an instrument de rÃ © gression sociale or tool of social regression .
1.7134	It articulates to good effect the right to human dignity and integrity of the person .
4.3247	As you know , the social and economic fundamental rights are particularly dear to my heart .
21.6730	The European institutions have power and , for the sake of our citizens , we must set limits on this power .
187.0809	The European public would not understand if Europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights .
6.3594	I want to highlight a couple of important points .
4.1783	There is yet another effect it will have , and this is on our own working methods .
6.9244	We already see the effects of judicial activism in Britain taking powers from our national parliament .
4682.0095	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I could not possibly improve upon Antonio Vitorino ' s speech , so I shall briefly speak to stress the quality of the debate in this House , which has no parallel except for the debate held within the Convention , and I should like to congratulate those Members of the European Parliament who participated in it , especially Mr MÃ © ndez de Vigo and Mrs Pervenche BerÃ ¨ s.
27.1723	I think the criticism that the citizens of Europe were not sufficiently involved in the process to be unfair in part .
9.3122	The point I wanted to make in mentioning all this is that Nice is a vital stage .
121.3964	Lengthy debates will be needed , both in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments , and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult .
111.0071	There has been a huge temptation to impose conditions on loans to Turkey , with reference to issues of democracy , but there has been no opportunity , technically speaking , to do so in this report .
86.1251	I have taken note of your wish , as expressed most clearly by Mr Morillon , to be fully involved in the destiny of Euro-Turkish relations .
5.9919	Major prospects are opening up to us , and we know the task will be long and complex .
76.3692	I repeat : accession negotiations are out of the question until we are sure that the political conditions have been met ; which is not the case at present .
2.9604	What all this means is that we still have a great deal of work to do .
885.3104	Here we are talking about establishing a special programme to consolidate the Customs Union , extending the mandate of the European Investment Bank so that it can cover new loans to Turkey in the 2000-2004 period amounting to EUR 450 million .
49.9236	On the other hand , a number of mayors have been arrested and the Hadep party have trouble in Kurdish areas in the south-east .
7.5504	Such a self-appraisal will amount to a veritable cultural revolution .
44.4334	There is another matter , and if we have to vote on it today , the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution .
1060.8146	The fact that the strategic aspects of the prospects of European integration have been addressed neither by the governments nor , Commissioner , by the Commission , and have not been discussed with Parliament in connection either with Turkey 's candidate status or with current enlargement to the east is , in my view , unacceptable given the implications .
428.3116	Lastly I do not feel that questions have been asked concerning the size of the actual population represented by Turkey ' s candidacy and the difficulties that this will cause , not only in terms of the Union ' s geography but especially in terms of the already delicate balance between large , medium-sized and small Member States .
629.1150	Mr President , with your permission I would like to briefly take up three fundamental points in Mr Morillon ' s report : the political influence exerted by the Turkish army , the Kurdish question and the aspect referred to earlier of ` tolerance for other religions and cultures ' .
12.0529	VOTE
276.9053	Madam President , I feel it my duty to stress that we are being called upon to regulate , through the Paciotti report and other directives and regulations which will be tabled before us , a great power : the power of information technology .
695.8250	On the EU level , the threat of possible abuse of personal data is being countered by two directives , namely Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector .
3.0459	We had no choice but to take them or leave them .
11.7861	However , for most countries and in comparison with international provisions already in force , it represents a step backwards .
505.7008	Its inclusion in the Charter , like the inclusion of many other similar articles , casts doubt on the accuracy of Article 51 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which states , `` This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union , or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties .
24.7632	At the same time , the Charter is far too reticent on the existence of national communities and their right to frame their own regulations .
229.3902	Since the ECJ , on the basis of the far more restricted text of the existing European treaties , has already displayed a worrying tendency towards judicial activism , this problem is likely to be especially acute .
12.9753	The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a document and a Charter shared by all the citizens of Europe !
157.2213	Europeans do have the ` right to work ' -LRB- it would have been surprising if they did not -RRB- ; they have the right to take `` collective action '' to defend their social interests , `` including strike action '' .
96.0470	The citizens of Europe have scant need of a formal declaration on the fundamental rights they are entitled to because these are recognised elsewhere in international conventions and in national law .
141.3772	For all the above reasons , this Charter must not be incorporated into the Treaties of the European Union , and we can not accept the text as it is currently worded .
5.1534	Secondly , the right to work is not directly stated .
7.4853	That makes including fundamental social rights even more important .
154.1089	In future , will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for Community institutions and , consequently , for the European public ?
8.6996	. -LRB- FR -RRB- I voted , most decidedly , against the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights before us .
8.4067	Ultimately there is nothing European about the text of the Charter .
63.0047	We supported these initiatives in general , except where the European Parliament amendments were tending to introduce too much of a federalist bias .
220.4233	- -LRB- DA -RRB- Even if we support the fight against money laundering and can therefore also endorse the need to equip the relevant authorities with the right tools for the job , we can not vote in favour of Mr Marinho ' s report .
6.2984	- -LRB- NL -RRB- There is often a fine line between business activities and white-collar crime .
69.9425	We are looking to extend the remit of Europol - the European Police Cooperation Unit - to cover serious international crime .
31.1719	Roure Report -LRB- A5-0314 / 2000 -RRB-
19.9292	In addition , the idea is that , on request , Member States should furnish details of all bank accounts held by suspects .
197.7060	I regret to say that it informs us that some of the members of the committees responsible for allocating the European funds for research in the sectors of hunting and fisheries also benefited from this research .
198.7698	All these factors go to show that Turkey ' s application for membership of the EU is one of the most important issues for the EU ' s future .
15.7244	The immediate Budget problem is that there is a danger of there being no margin left in the guarantee fund reserve .
1629.1976	Something along these lines might have been more helpful , including for Turkey , because it would have sent a more accurate message to the forces in Turkey which really do intend to modernise the country and it would have supported their efforts to put conditions in place which guarantee its European prospects , giving them serious arguments with which to convince the many sceptics that those prospects are , in fact , well-founded .
28.8340	Muslims follow one of the three Abrahaminic faiths .
23.4020	The EU ' s four freedoms can not be applied to the whole of Cyprus following the partition .
12.9144	I agree with that entirely and I think that the report by the honourable Member shows how this can be achieved .
66.5751	Commission Verheugen has confirmed that the Cyprus issue plays a very important part in the discussions currently being conducted with Turkey .
175.6085	In other words , we are talking about increasing the degree to which Turkey is subject to the economic , political and military objectives of big business in the European Union .
73.0152	I therefore think we must encourage the Turkish authorities to forge ahead in order to achieve the necessary compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria .
66.7968	Allow me to correct the erroneous impression , which one or two speakers are clearly under , that it is already a fact of life .
83.4347	The author of the questions - Mr Brok - would normally take the floor first , but he is in a meeting with the President and is on his way .
28.3295	In this respect , I believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit .
107.8150	In Marseilles , therefore , this new impetus we wish to give the process must be based on all its political and economic components which are , let me reiterate , complementary and inextricably interlinked .
306.7375	This is a major challenge for the Europe of the future , whose centre of gravity will , indeed , be shifting towards the East of the continent , but this need not happen at the expense of relations with the South .
77.1430	The current situation in the Middle East is making abundantly clear what measures are needed in the form of joint policies and cooperation .
221.7403	The Commission has been encouraged by the generally positive reaction to the proposals that we set out on reinvigorating the Barcelona process , both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners .
100.8213	I just want to say one more thing about MEDA and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which Members are having elsewhere .
209.3995	The first concerned the preference shown for free trade , which is linked to the process of economic and commercial liberalisation in terms of codevelopment , economic integration , social policies , cultural dialogue and the training and enhancement of human resources .
651.7622	As Commissioner Patten indicated , it is clear that the lack of consolidated peace in the Middle East is distorting the whole process that was outlined at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference and , in particular , the appropriate and correct application of the MEDA funds .
38.4210	I strenuously urge all my fellow Members to set aside the appropriations needed for us to be able to take action and to be able to consider the projects .
521.7450	The Marseilles Conference could have been used to this end . The failure - or , at least , the relative failure - of the Charter for Peace and Stability proves that it is not possible to achieve Europe ' s `` security '' on the basis of marginalising the South and closing borders .
319.7864	We can hypothesise as to whether a decisive , uniform EU policy in the Balkans might have prevented the Balkan war and the European Union might therefore have avoided the consequential costs of the war .
50.0417	It is continuity over time that can provide results , and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean .
141.2691	The Commission and the Council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in Feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the Mediterranean region viable .
10.2664	This is one of the major issues of the French Presidency .
25.6503	Also , we can not demand that European citizens properly implement their environmental policy and not apply this to other countries .
1240.5517	I happened to be at a conference in Zagreb last week , when once again it became evident how important it is not to teach future generations of mini Balkans citizens - as it were - old stereotypes , or inculcate them with notions of ` the enemy ' , and instead , to made a fresh start in this respect .
122.4535	I have drawn such positive conclusions from my various visits to the agency because as I see it , despite all - and I repeat , all - the mistakes that are made there , there can be no doubt that they have found a new and effective way to deliver aid .
2.9367	In doing this , of course , we are staking our credibility and our own stability .
45.1900	Mr President , I feel that the content of this important measure has been clearly and very well explained by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza .
53.6374	As we have seen in Bosnia time and again , the Americans manage to show themselves to good advantage with very limited funds .
1972.4838	Mr Swoboda will say a little more , on behalf of my group , about what I would like to call ` efforts to reconstruct the EU ' , which is also the subject of the reports under discussion today , courtesy of Mr Lagendijk and Mr Westendorp , to whom I offer my compliments .
78.7793	We must concentrate our energies in the physical reconstruction of former Yugoslavia , but this will only work if we manage to alter the people ' s frame of mind too .
35.3724	I should like to speak in more detail about the priorities set by the Presidency-in-Office for the Western Balkans .
86.8677	The Presidency-in-Office , like you , would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid : fewer procedures , greater coordination out in the field , fewer outstanding commitments .
84.9240	The European Union must not be afraid to say to these countries : yes , your place , your future is within the European family .
461.8647	Subject : Rapid Reaction Facility Why has this proposal not been discussed formally under the French Council Presidency , although work had certainly begun on this issue under its predecessors ?
527.3350	Subject : Western Sahara On 13-15 September a delegation from the European Parliament ' s Intergroup on Peace for the Sahrawi People , in which I participated , visited the Sahrawi refugee camps in South-Eastern Algeria .
9.1260	Thank you for your reply .
25.2876	Question No 4 by -LRB- H-0820 / 00 -RRB- :
1115.6829	The Union is therefore closely monitoring contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan with a view to finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict , which is why it welcomes the meetings that have regularly taken place between the two Presidents and hopes that they will lead to a political solution .
24.8560	Question No 7 by -LRB- H-0832 / 00 -RRB- :
176.4631	Would the Council also - and this is where I agree with Mrs Frahm - encourage the Member States to differentiate more clearly between asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants ?
53.6504	. -LRB- FR -RRB- Mrs Theorin has drawn the Council ' s attention to the issue of crimes of honour in Turkey .
24.8560	Question No 9 by -LRB- H-0839 / 00 -RRB- :
218.3096	This , moreover , has always been the case within the European Union , as the sanctions taken against Austria were done so on a bilateral basis , which is something I should like to stress .
57.1095	The European Union has certain values , which make it difficult for it to accept some countries taking on particular responsibilities .
11684.6771	Subject : Council reply to letter from the Turkish Foreign Minister , Mr Cem In a supplementary question -LRB- Question Time of 5 September 2000 - Question H-610 / 00 -RRB- I had the opportunity to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the Council 's response to the letter sent by the Turkish Foreign Minister , Mr Cem , to the 15 Foreign Ministers of the European Union in which he sought to promote his own interpretation of the Helsinki Summit conclusions .
25.5567	It is in this spirit that we must proceed , and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will do everything possible to reach the right agreement .
164.2339	In this regard , the calendar for negotiations that was recently set included one meeting per week , so we can be fairly optimistic that negotiations will be swiftly concluded .
999.2182	Anyway , allow me to say that Mr Fischler is neither Mediterranean nor is he from the Atlantic , and what is more we are unfortunate enough to have a Director-General for Fisheries who is from the north Atlantic and only learnt about fisheries problems when he was recently appointed to that post .
128.2396	These meetings seem to have revived the negotiation process and led to another meeting with a Moroccan delegation on 30 October 2000 , therefore very recently .
143.0209	. -LRB- FR -RRB- Yes , I simply wanted to say that it is precisely because we are sensitive to this issue that a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions is possible .
80.3294	In this context , the Council attaches the greatest priority to pushing this work forward in the following areas : the promotion of renewable energy sources , energy efficiency , the security of energy supplies and the diversification of energy sources .
255.1129	However , it must be regretfully pointed out that the US Government has not yet taken any action regarding its own commitments under the agreement concluded at the London Summit in May 1998 .
22.4653	If you do not see the difference between that and any other position , then perhaps there is a degree of misunderstanding , possibly intentional .
5338.4750	Fourthly and finally , does he not think that his reply is an encouragement to Turkey , a candidate country for membership of the European Union , to continue its present policy of contesting the sovereign rights of Greece , a member of the European Union and that he has therefore indirectly admitted that there are border disputes which must be resolved , as we have said , on the basis of international conventions ?
5961.9268	I therefore propose , that not only should we leave these people in peace to get on with their job with the gusto and enthusiasm which they have shown so far , not only should we refrain from upsetting the modus operandi of the agency , although we should , of course , make it responsible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and anywhere else it is needed , but we should also ask them to pass their know-how on to other committees whose work , as we all know , is so abysmal , so inefficient and brings in such poor results .
13.0063	These are the objectives we need to achieve with the funds and instruments which we are now creating .
3.2468	Anyway , enough of the bad news , now to the good news .
141.0165	The vulnerable countries surrounding the remains of Yugoslavia have weathered the crisis , and , what is more , Bulgaria , Albania and Macedonia have even made economic progress .
88.4893	He is at least one other human being with whom I can share the distinction of having read Misha Glenny on the Balkans .
575.1946	This programme is going to ratchet up every day from now on : a contract for imports of EUR 30 million in electricity was signed today with the Serbian Electricity Company and should come on-stream within days .
3.8132	As Mr Staes said : We do not want people throwing spanners in the works .
1284.7491	I can accept , too , those amendments which refer to the General Affairs decision of 9 October , to cooperation with NGOs , to the restoration of civil society and the rule of law , to the payment for services provided by the Agency , to third parties , to the possibility of creating further operational centres , to the responsibility of the director for the implementation of the work programme and the structure of the Agency 's budget .
1503.8442	We outlined our goals for ASEM III in our working party , we discussed it with the European Parliament before the summit on two occasions in the ASEAN working party and in the plenary which resulted , I believe , in your resolution of 5 October , the aims of which we not only took into account , but also managed to achieve in most cases .
503.6857	Human rights and the rule of law are embedded in the process ; there was a clear understanding of the need for the early start of a broad-based WTO round but I am not sure that has been entirely reflected so far at the discussions at the APEC meetings in Brunei .
1231.6429	You are quite right that the Asian Summit was somewhat dominated , in the positive sense , by developments in both North and South Korea , with the result that more time was spent evaluating and qualifying the rapprochement on the Korean peninsular than on a real in-depth discussion of the Asia process .
8.6469	We could have done so much more in terms of financial stability , trade and investments , and infrastructure .
630.1073	In future the Commission must not confine itself to being a mere figurehead : it must unequivocally and specifically take up all aspects of the Community 's participation in these regional organisations , representing it , monitoring the transmission and verification of data , participating in scientific fora , and in general guiding Community action , including monitoring the fishing carried out in the context of these organisations .
4812.9477	I have been an observer in some regional organisations and I can assure you that it is pathetic to see two or three mid-ranking officials , exhausted and hardly getting any sleep , trying to react to problems that could be seen coming months earlier and facing high-powered delegations , which are high-powered either because they are from great powers like the United States or Japan or because they have followed an intelligent policy of forming alliances in advance .
1.6796	The fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region .
0.2228	They carry out statistical programmes and are responsible for inspections and the monitoring system .
1.4327	To some extent , those of us who are politicians find ourselves in the middle .
71.7988	It is in fact the Member States - in keeping with the basic structure of the European Union - which are primarily responsible for controls .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
60.9044	Ladies and gentlemen , under these conditions , the problem concerns less the future of production than the future of producers .
374.3719	Mr President , the Commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the European Union is subject to cyclical movements , with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet .
105.3209	Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report , even if I do not agree with its content .
302.0324	If we were to apply the co-financing estimated here , i.e. 50 % , to the other organisations of the market , for example in sugar , where the PPE is vehemently opposed to any change , that would instantly free up huge resources .
7.6436	Nor does this report offer any ready solutions ; too much else needs to be done for that .
7.2779	Efforts can not be made by producers alone .
26.8621	I would like to point out , however , that at this stage we should not be embarking on a regulated economy in the pig industry .
17.3018	While the policy is good , and while I pay tribute to it , we have to go back to the drawing board .
367.1928	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first , I should like to thank you , Mr Garot , as rapporteur , for your excellent report on the introduction of a compensation fund in the common organisation or the market in pigmeat .
317.4097	Plus , the weight of piglets various enormously , from 8 to 30 kg , and there is , as it were , no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets , meaning that there is no basis on which to support them .
9.9874	Perhaps you could explain .
140.5687	In each of the chapters the Court reports on the progress made in a number of areas on which it had reported in the past and I will return to some of these issues in my presentation .
2.5500	They mainly comprise non-compliance with eligibility rules , overclaims , insufficient justification and calculation errors .
151.6962	On the other hand , the Commission will be aware that it has now raised high expectations and that it is obliged to put into practice its good intentions and to produce results .
45.7198	The Court of Auditors also makes it clear in its report that the errors identified by the Court do not amount to fraud , nor are they detrimental to the budget .
101.0934	But we are now coming to a difficult stretch , where we need the support of the European Parliament , the Council and also the Court of Auditors .
49.6579	But if there is no closure , that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management , just as we said back in January .
7.0503	However , I should like to know how serious the situation is regarding the 1999 accounts .
10.3748	Some unpalatable facts will emerge of course but , at the same time , we are demonstrating that transparency exists .
1.6761	They could perhaps be given a push in the right direction , if need be .
37.3913	There is also indeed a need for action in the regional and national parliaments , because it is the Member States themselves that are responsible for a great many errors .
10.0220	We in Parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the Commission carries out this task .
91.3761	I especially appreciate the impartiality of his report , in which he points out the faults and praises the progress ; for instance , he praises the fact that the Commission is getting moving .
244.7357	We must not forget that this report refers to the 1999 budget , the year when there was the forced resignation of the Commission , so it is clearly too early to judge yet .
0.4649	Without the facts we are fighting fraud with one hand tied behind our back .
20.4022	I think that if the Court leaves this much room for interpretation in its report , the result will always be critical headlines .
171.2604	I urge you , there really is some scope for improvement in the future - otherwise , your protestations that you want to adopt the right approach in tackling irregularities will merely be empty words .
36.5917	The report is positive about steps that have been taken by Parliament to remedy problems that have been identified by the Court , too positive in my view .
1.8538	We also still need to continue to question the implementing of fiscal harmonisation .
337.5169	In 1995 , almost 40 % of payments went to the top 3 % of beneficiaries , whilst 57 % , the smaller beneficiaries , received only 4.5 % of payments .
4.0761	We will study that in detail , with your excellent secretaries .
905.3876	You are listening to a Member who , as rapporteur for the Committee on Development , was once responsible for naming not only two countries but two companies and where the Court of Auditors was taken to the Court of Justice because of that .
9.9722	I must comment , Mr Blak , on what you said .
125.3622	Mr President , unfortunately we can not accept some amendments first tabled in the Committee on the Environment and now tabled here , which go against these principles .
1214.8003	In light of recent experience , notably the European Court of Justice ruling on tobacco advertising , I can really only urge this House to heed the recommendations to plenary of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as the committee responsible for such matters .
89.8079	There are many countries that have their own regulations and safety standards which meet those countries ' needs far better than standards currently in force in Europe .
63.8464	She may occasionally have found the eccentricities of British car boot sales hard to follow but that , too , came within the remit of her personal charity .
5.5591	The charity shops welcome the general protection of this directive .
305.7707	Two final remarks , the first of which relates specifically to a particular amendment concerning the Commission ' s proposal that producers should inform the competent authorities immediately when they discover that a product is dangerous .
1.7940	We must give more consideration to this diversity in the directive on general product safety .
1329.2379	Then , some years later , when I allowed my second daughter , who is six or seven years younger , to go out on her own , Elisabetta protested : `` But Daddy , you never let me go out on my own and here you are , letting my sister out alone , and she is younger than I was !
125.5803	However , it would have been better to have an EU regulation providing for a general European system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in Europe .
1824.9701	First of all I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs GonzÃ ¡ lez Ã  lvarez , the draftsmen , Mr RÃ 1/4 big and Mr Lehne , and the respective committees for their very comprehensive report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety .
35.1208	The notification is compulsory in the United States but not , so far , in the European Union .
815.9599	Firstly , Amendments Nos 1 , 8 and 18 propose to exempt second-hand goods sold by charity shops and non-profit organisations , private persons , flea markets and car boot sales , as Mr Whitehead has said , from the obligation to provide information and documentation on product risk and product origin .
187.0083	Amendments Nos 6 and 29 require the Commission to consider approaches or submit a proposal relating to the safety of services in Amendment No 29 before a specified date .
10.1901	This would also run counter to the objective of encouraging business to take proactive measures on its own initiative .
27.4455	The discussions in Council go in the direction of dealing with the services within the definition of product which is , in fact , acceptable to us .
7.8470	In addition , effective market surveillance can not be carried out under the proposed limitations regarding confidential information .
16.9442	Mr President , I have been a socialist in Italy and in international organisations for 30 years .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.25 p.m. -RRB-
5.3772	We have highly qualified people assisting us with our work .
16.8663	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB- Explanations of vote
31.3725	It is in consideration of this dual responsibility that I tabled amendments referring to the governments of the Euromed States .
112.9041	Mr President , I voted for this report , which lays down the action to be taken by the European Community in order to bring about genuine gender equality .
3.6496	We are against the social regression represented by the authorisation of night work for women .
4.6771	I have some reservations as far as the content is concerned .
259.4447	Mr President , there are several reasons why I voted against the GonzÃ ¡ lez Ã  lvarez report but , in order to keep within the minute allowed for this explanation of vote , I will mention only one .
200.3334	This report welcomes an improvement in current European law on product safety , but in my view the directive should not be applied to charity shops , a key feature in the British high street .
34.5463	The European Parliament has rallied to the call of its old friend and has just voted for amendments in its favour .
15.0480	So we must give President Rugova and President Kostunica a chance to negotiate democratically with each other .
29.3742	The proposal is unnecessary and harmful because it introduces a new form of aid for a sector which has so far acquitted itself well without aid .
802.8521	With regard to the overriding issue of the Community ' s contribution to the fund , I also wish to point out that the proposals in the Garot report are an improvement as compared with the Commission ' s position , but we still disagree with the idea of linking this contribution to the principle of CAP cofinancing which was , in fact , rejected in Agenda 2000 .
7.8313	The Commission is right to try and find ways in which to secure the income of pig farmers .
33.4738	Franz Werfel had Jewish and German-Bohemian relatives .
298.1869	As far as human rights are concerned , however , the report confines itself to ` encouraging the Turkish Government ' , ` calling ' on it to do better , without European countries ever threatening it , even if only to stop delivering arms .
2414.9253	- -LRB- FR -RRB- It was at the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 that the European Union decided to grant Turkey the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union and to establish an accession partnership and a single financial framework with a view to helping Turkey 's application to progress in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria .
5.0775	She wants the penal law changed , as do we .
6.9962	The necessary changes can not be bought outside by the governing powers ; they must come from within .
282.3536	I remember the exact text of the conclusions of the Presidency in Paragraph 12 : `` Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to candidate countries '' .
0.2256	Consistency and honesty should be the hallmarks of our dealings with any applicant country .
6.2599	We can not accept any of these approaches .
22.8445	It is therefore important that this mandate is defined clearly in terms of time and content and that it is strictly monitored by the Council .
40.8220	Things did not go as swimmingly for Parliament ' s amendments from first reading , as the Council rejected most of them .
119.5226	Finally , I anticipate our being able to tighten up the waste incineration directive in a few years ' time , in close consultation with industry .
28.3900	We all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste .
248.0015	The end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste , improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat .
26.3410	Genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention , re-use and recycling .
2.9837	The end result can be considered good , and with good reason .
151.7385	I am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balance - a view reflected in your speeches yesterday - incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders .
117.0755	Providing guaranteed access for all European citizens to high-quality necessary medical treatment within reasonable time limits is a primary objective towards which the efforts and financing of obligatory and supplementary systems must converge .
86.6327	Mr President , I should like to thank the Committee Chairman , Mr Rocard , for his words of praise in connection with my opinion .
10.0088	We are talking subsidiarity .
4.1016	That is scarcely what you would call a responsible social policy .
143.4321	Supplementary health insurance must be just that : supplementary , for example , for those who are willing to pay for an extra service , or designed to cover the costs of more ordinary and frequently occurring illnesses for which actuarial calculations can reasonably be made .
1.4500	I am rather ashamed to admit it , but I chose that solution .
8.2179	Let us not add to this a two-speed Europe of health .
863.3318	Leaving aside for the moment the question as to whether these changes were for the better , one thing is for sure : far too little attention was given to the effects of these changes on cross-border workers , retired Dutch nationals living abroad , and for example , Germans and Belgians working in the Netherlands .
251.3913	That means that the present statutory health insurance system , which has , up to now , been based on the principle of social solidarity , will be reduced to an '' Ã la carte '' health system .
190.2089	His report is a useful contribution to that debate , though I hope he agrees in turn that the contributions made in committee , including those made on this side of the House , may perhaps have made it even more useful .
674.5046	It is , moreover , a fact that social systems - protection systems - have been suffering from the influences and consequences of economic , demographic and public health situations , etc . And it is also a fact that economic recession , unemployment , social exclusion , the appearance of new diseases , the ageing of the population , as well as advances in research , improved therapies , the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover .
192.1251	And so I and my pensioner friends call upon Commissioner Diamantopoulou to put on a doctor 's white coat , to treat the European Union 's poorly medical service and to make us better .
21.3012	The better the statutory system , the less need there will be for supplementary health insurance , and the less significant it will be .
5.2238	The new proposal before us is for a Green Paper .
16.9391	However , it is essential to draw up an in-depth report on the situation and we can do this as soon as possible .
2077.2991	It is crucial for the Council to keep the promises it has given , not only with regard to the programme , but also with regard to setting appropriate objectives and goals , to be agreed on by the end of this year , so that it meets the expectations it created with the Lisbon Summit conclusions on its commitment to combat poverty , unemployment and social exclusion .
8094.1522	This is not just a subject for discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it is also of concern to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , because these 65 million people are not only excluded from access to financial and other resources , because they are not only excluded from social and cultural rights , but because they are also prevented from using their talents to help shape our society and because they are prevented from developing their own talents , gaining additional qualifications and skills and working in jobs they are suited for .
169.1262	As you will remember , the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close , on-going supervision of the Member States ' budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union .
67.9960	Secondly , we shall also try to assess to what extent budget cuts and tax cuts are consistent , according to a number of principles which may enable us to adopt a common position on this point .
216.9916	Because of this factor and , more importantly , better budgetary positions and stronger economic growth , there will be a clear tendency for the proportions of national debt to fall over the coming years .
216.6620	Today , taking the average for the euro area , it has dropped back to around 1 % , and we are moving towards balanced budgets , that is to say very much in the right direction .
48.2908	When I mentioned overheating , I was referring more to the economies of the Netherlands and Finland than to the German economy .
35.3655	It also emphasises that national debt reductions , insofar as they can reduce future deficits , may help to resolve the situation .
78.3313	It is important to take stock of the situation with regard to the fight against BSE in the broader context of food safety developments in Europe .
22.2867	That is why the efforts that have been made since 1997 in terms of research will be extended and broadened .
21.6104	Only the dangerously complacent or naÃ ¯ ve could assume that we have safely put the BSE crisis behind us .
14.6272	The consumer reaction to BSE has been variously described as a psychosis , irrational or driven by panic .
0.5105	Extensive testing now appears to be the most effective means of providing such reassurance .
50.8134	Many inspections by the Commission 's Food and Veterinary Office point to weaknesses in the implementation of these controls .
27.3379	This includes in my view the responsibility not to mislead them into believing that there are magic solutions to a very difficult problem .
67.1734	This proposal aims at putting in place a Community framework which will address all relevant issues governing the treatment of animal waste , especially its use in animal feed .
479.3712	That is also why I wish to say here that the Commission must have powers at such times of crisis to take more rapid decisions in relation to infringements of Community law or when there is an imminent risk of such infringement , and that it should be in a position to take action in the public interest or if public health is threatened .
243.6327	If you are serious about all this , then you do not need a token Food Authority , which might prepare legislation on food safety , but which is not in a position to deliver what we can : good legislation and controls .
6.2754	Every food producer must be aware of this fact .
31.7669	The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which can not be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented .
110.2993	The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices , which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector .
6.4633	The facts stand , and they are appalling .
4.1631	This test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly .
29.0319	Unless there is mandatory general testing , confidence will not be restored , for confidence can not be restored by decree ; it has to be earned .
47.7891	These are the real causes of the crisis , and it is only by tackling these causes that you will be able to permanently solve this appalling problem , which you helped to create .
56.3665	If France is now in the situation in which it finds itself , it is because it practises controls which do not exist elsewhere .
6.2257	Production must be improved , and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy .
7.3381	You played no part in it whatsoever .
13.9067	We have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole BSE issue .
107.3996	Mr President , like many others , I want to thank Commissioner Byrne for his customary vigilance and also the French Minister for being here today .
3.7501	Lastly , we must make greater speed in urging the Council to act on our behalf .
474.1547	Now , the Community can not cultivate more than 5.5 million hectares of oil seeds , nor does it have the right to do so , even though our needs are in the order of 18 million hectares .
9.3451	Only then can we say to the public `` This meat has been tested and you can eat it '' .
205.7933	It is not acceptable if Germany , for example , does not introduce universal testing , but just tests in North Rhine-Westphalia , for fear of no longer having BSE-free status .
59.5818	Madam President , I am totally convinced that the Union in its entirety lacks the political , moral and educational authority to talk about the quality and safety of food .
30.7490	In the Netherlands , the legislation governing the use of offal in animal feed is already relatively stringent as matters stand .
23.4074	Madam President , I speak today both as an MEP and a beef farmer from the United Kingdom .
56.3809	It is very difficult for a feed mill to guarantee that its production lines are completely cleared of meat-and-bone meal before they start manufacturing feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry .
13.9845	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I have listened with great interest to everything that has been said .
1098.6499	Rest assured that , when it comes to continuing the work in the Council and my exchanges with the Commission , I will bear all this in mind , in the full knowledge that reaching agreement within the institutions is one of the best ways of dealing with a problem as complex and universal as that of food safety .
13.6330	You are therefore saying that the legislation that is in place is in some way inadequate or not being complied with .
0.2286	This is a consumer protection measure and also a measure to enhance consumer confidence .
3072.3126	Mr President , in my contribution to a secular miracle , I wish to say that , with regard to the harmonisation of asylum policy , the main measures that the Union will be adopting are defined not only in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council , but are also part of the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council and to the European Parliament , and will develop in two basic stages .
20.6414	The list of examples given in the question is the result of selective memory , which I feel is hardly appropriate in these cases .
149.7700	The Commission approved a pan-European policy to combat trafficking in human beings back in 1996 , with particular emphasis on the issue of women , who are the worst hit by this scourge .
684.8369	This operation consists of everything included under economic policy coordination , which has two basic aims : first , that the economic policies of the various Member States should not be incongruent with each other , and secondly , that they should not be incongruent with monetary policy either , generating a situation that could result in an over-restrictive monetary policy .
19.8483	First of all , it is a fact that we have an internal euro effect and an external euro effect .
4.9935	During the procedure the Greek authorities made known that the directive had now been transposed .
7.2929	There is the possibility of using Community funding for establishing networks and for measurements in Greece .
12.2150	Questions Nos 30 to 59 will be replied to in writing .
7.3571	Therefore , Commissioner , I ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty .
596.2845	Fourthly , by helping to define guidelines and national action plans along the same lines as the Luxembourg procedure on employment , based , therefore , on indicators and objectives which are not minimal but of a high level of requirement corresponding to the idea we have of the European social model .
25.3609	It would be interesting to hear from the Council , at some point , whether they are proposing to rectify this omission at the Nice Summit .
5.5697	All these groups are threatened by social exclusion if very extensive measures of support are not provided .
505.6346	If we do not reform the labour and welfare markets , re-establishing them on the basis of individual freedom and responsibility rather than on State and trade union paternalism , then I am afraid that our committees and our efforts at coordination will do very little for the poor of the European Union .
15.8086	Between 1980 and 1995 overall inequality rose in Member States .
3.9890	Mr President , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a quite excellent report .
153.9235	We must nevertheless issue a warning about the inadequacy of the NGOs ' financial control mechanisms , and demand a better system of financial management equal to the task of ensuring that public funds are spent in a sensible and rigorous way .
281.2799	After the Treaty of Amsterdam and some months after the Lisbon council , we all know that a new context has been created for Community action in the area of social policies and social exclusion and social protection .
1.5951	You know there is a political and theoretical discussion on the word `` poverty '' .
68.5582	Close cooperation between the contact group and the Social Protection Committee will ensure the exchange of views between the Council and Parliament .
3.2232	This is therefore the first legislative procedure in the field of renewable energy .
27.9993	In The Hague , the western industrialised nations are currently again being pilloried because they are only implementing those commitments half-heartedly .
475.3936	I hope that tomorrow this House will take a step forward on the basis of this proposed legislation and our opinion on it , and that you will be able to state , on behalf of the Commission , that you can accept our amendments and that the Council will then be next in line to do its bit !
3.6635	Investments in the environment are neither cost-free nor do they come into the field of competition .
1708.4955	After all , on the one hand , this directive is an important element in the series of measures taken to enable us to honour the commitment the EU entered into in Kyoto regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases and , on the other , it is a praiseworthy attempt to reduce the European Union ' s dependence on the oil-producing countries .
139.6726	I do not want electricians to cause interference between the two systems and to sow confusion and doubt amongst investors in Europe by short-circuiting and manipulating the system of guaranteed prices .
119.0176	Mr President , the Commission and the rapporteur are right to formulate long-term objectives for promoting electricity production from renewable energy sources , although what we need is a dynamic approach in these matters .
189.1238	We see it as building on the work of our colleague , Mr Mombaur , in advocating a greater share of electricity and energy in the European Union from these sources .
45.0861	The share should aim to be doubled in the next ten years ; it could well be more than that .
42.1067	There is a risk of renewables being stillborn or strangled at birth by the utilities that have a monopoly , if they can charge huge sums for grid access .
162.5812	Since , at the same time , the EU has to adhere to the climatic targets set at Kyoto , it is especially important that we invest more and more in research into renewables .
17.0403	Sustainable energy is often associated with small-scale solutions : solar panels on everyone ' s roof and a windmill in every village .
142.4000	The problem we have with different support systems in the Member States , referred to by Mr Chichester , is but one example of the need for a more common approach in this field .
169.6348	The second problem is that of household waste : strictly speaking it is not a renewable energy , but one must guard against sending a negative signal as regards the incineration of household waste .
97.0534	Lastly , I am aware that all this is easy to criticise and difficult to carry out , but if we do not act immediately , within a few generations we shall be in deep water , and that will lead us to disaster .
37.9676	As I have said , we can not take advantage of biomass in the case of unpolluted woods and we support Amendment No 24 .
211.4904	On the other hand , we could accept Amendments Nos 10 and 59 , which state that investment aid to large hydroelectric plants would only be possible in the event that they contribute to improving the environment .
5.1226	Conflicts are more likely to arise within rather than between States .
254.0435	This is also apparent from a series of UN documents , most recently the resolution concerning women , peace and security adopted by the Security Council two weeks ago .
57.2187	As , unfortunately , this is not regarded as obvious , this report makes a very specific demand for women to be integrated into these bodies and for them to be given a participatory role .
3.5351	In terms of objectives , this resolution broadly resembles the proposal now on the table .
21.7612	As regards women , since women are participants in history , they must now become players in the peace process .
8.7008	The training of men in all aspects of gender-related issues would also be of real help to the situation .
62.0409	When I listen to the various comments made , I find myself agreeing with those who recommend that we take a look at our priorities and then limit the number of aims we want to achieve .
120.7500	These pacific qualities in women could provide an alternative solution , the basis for the foundations of a new civilisation , a civilisation of peace , in which dialogue is protected at all levels and from which war and violence are excluded as a means of resolving differences .
2.4796	Women and men , and people in general , are all different .
16.1526	My only consolation is that this says a great deal about Mrs Theorin ' s parliamentary abilities .
102.1799	I strongly object to the attitude of mind , expressed in this Chamber this evening , whereby one sex is made collectively guilty .
403.5953	At the Commission 's initiative , 5 % of the resources may be provided for special projects , such as training civil servants at reception centres , the police and public hygiene officials in how to deal with the special needs of women refugees .
431.2974	I have therefore tried to establish , in various countries , but also at European level , how many people - insofar as this can be established , because the people concerned are often working ` on the black ' of course - work in this sector .
36.1931	I now come to my final point , that of migrant women , which is , of course , a very specific problematic area .
8.2397	Mrs Smet has done a wonderful job and of course we are going to support it .
161.2094	Domestic work is often heavy , involving many places of work . Wages are too low , there is an increase in illicit work , and a situation often prevails in which women , often immigrants , are the first to be exploited .
19.3807	Of course , both employers and workers - generally both women - are often happy with this state of affairs , which saves money .
604.2970	Mr President , it is with tremendous pleasure , profound respect for you and the people of Yugoslavia , and with great hope for the future that is opening up in your country and in the new relations between us that the European Parliament welcomes you here today .
83.8983	There is no better landmark for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in its state recovery and social development than the European Union .
63.5955	The democratic changes that began in Yugoslavia on 5 October have produced at miraculous speed extraordinary results on the international political plane .
15.3469	It is important to say that Muslims and Albanians inhabit Serbia and Montenegro in significant numbers .
8.2845	After all , Europe is a home we all share .
23.0655	The Minutes of the previous day 's sitting have been distributed .
5626.5724	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0318 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament , Council and Commission documents -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 30 - C5-0057 / 2000 - 2000/0032 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB- .
4.9411	What we have before us is , in fact , the work of these two committees .
6.8316	The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction .
62.4552	The opportunity of gaining access to public documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy , something the EU has precious little of at present .
5.2944	That is why we can not accept the long list of exceptions set out by the Commission .
624.5280	I also hope that the Council and the Commission can give us a commitment today to continuing to deal with this issue in a positive way so that we might , as quickly as possible , start making the necessary changes to the business procedures in such a way as to benefit people and the image of the institutions .
34.5783	We would also like to emphasis the important role the Ombudsman has played in the progress that has , nevertheless , been made .
333.9389	It must be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice , the Ombudsman or the relevant EU authority , and Parliament must always be able to question the grounds for confidentiality .
51.5638	I would like to draw attention to the Internet and other possibilities which in the future may facilitate access to documents .
34.6954	Mr President , a word about the position of the European Commission , because I have already talked about the Council .
84.8716	It is a project which may lead to citizens being placed in a position in which they are co-players and active participants and are not just spectators or like pawns in interesting , large-scale games of chess .
9.8745	The citizens have to be able to find out how their government has voted on highly important matters .
1.8638	The regulation is marked by imprecision , which will produce legal uncertainty for the citizens .
13.7925	Openness in legislative work and in public administration is , of course , crucial to our democracies being able to function .
15.1002	It is now that we have the chance to make the EU more open and more democratic .
69.0778	Fortunately , the Cashman/Maij-Wegen report represents an attempt to compile a document which lays down the citizen ' s right to access to documents , and not the right of institutions to impose restrictions .
369.7800	It is not just chance that we have heard almost only Scandinavians speak here , with very few speakers from Germany or Italy and , so far at least , I believe , none from France .
98.6011	Naturally we have to finally decide on the sort of practices which would shed public light on the work of the Council , and no set of derogations must be allowed to let the Council retreat behind it in the way it did before .
323.5825	At the end of the day , exchange of information is an essential foundation of modern democracy , which is nurtured by public debate , media and public control and the contribution of social organisations .
43.5702	The Treaty recognises the citizens ' right to have access to the documents of the European institutions in accordance with certain principles and conditions .
24.0733	I am referring in particular to texts for internal use and to initial drafts and preparatory study documents for exclusively internal use by the institutions .
5.6328	Therefore the principle that documents should be subject to a classification system does not raise any problems .
136.4301	It is not for the Commission to tell political groups what decisions they should make on the amendments that have come from the different political groups and therefore the Commissioner should not be placed in this invidious position .
2086.3930	The Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Malta held its 14th meeting here in Strasbourg , yesterday and today , and focused its discussions on the EU-Malta accession negotiations , on the basis of the periodic report by the European Commission on the progress Malta has made in its preparations for accession , which , as you know , was published in November 2000 .
21.1739	We also accept that there is a need for regulators to have the power to impose particular and additional charges on particular banks .
3176.7449	Report -LRB- A5-0307 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Figueiredo , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 368 - C5-0317 / 2000 - 2000/0157 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB-
7.3259	So I would be grateful if the Liberals could take a more pragmatic and speedier approach .
24.9139	It is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues can not be here in the evening .
0.4594	Mr President , I am totally opposed to what is happening here in Parliament .
290.2795	Mr President , I find , somewhat to my consternation , that the vote on the report I was to present in plenary and which is on this morning ' s agenda has been postponed inadvertently without anyone noticing .
77.7236	With regard to Friday , there do not appear to have been any further developments , and in any case , this will also be brought to the attention of the Conference of Presidents .
53.7309	Today , complete uncertainty reigns in a climate of anxiety as to the risks in store , and neither consumers nor government authorities have any information on them .
50.1323	Perhaps quality farming is a little more expensive , but the apparent savings gained by farming geared to productivity in fact end up as terrible costs for society as a whole .
4.4632	That is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle .
3.4149	The lack of consumer confidence is spreading and the agricultural markets are battening down the hatches .
27.5225	It is unthinkable that we should be trying to run a single market without common rules for such a major sector as that of public health .
6.6808	The time has come for a global debate .
304.5161	We must strictly respect the wishes of those Member States that intend to put food safety and consumer health above all other concerns , their resolve to give priority to scientifically based decisions and to the precautionary principle in regard to any measures they take , while choosing the middle road between the positions of the various partners , and especially those who are most lax .
321.4230	However , if more than 40 % of the waste incinerated in plants of this kind consists of toxic waste or untreated , mixed municipal waste , the plant will have to comply with the more stringent standards of another annex on incineration .
30.5749	Mr President , I voted for the Figuereido report on the eradication of social exclusion and poverty , to quote the actual text of the report .
0.2087	. -LRB- FR -RRB- We abstained on this report , even the amended version .
32.1878	Even though the unemployment rate has fallen , there are still 16 million unemployed in the European Union .
560.3552	- -LRB- FR -RRB- There is 18 % of the population of Europe , or 60 million people , living on less than 60 % of the average national income -LRB- the low-income threshold used to measure relative poverty -RRB- .
0.2446	That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion .
330.2643	I fully endorse this innovative measure that has benefited many young people in particular , through strong action on truancy and school exclusion , sleeping rough , teenage pregnancy and providing support to 16-18 year olds not in education , employment or training .
5.3046	Mr President , I voted for the report on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources .
38.1518	If the Union wants to remain competitive in this sector , it will have to contribute by using and developing the technologies concerned , which implies major public funding .
91.9914	. -LRB- DE -RRB- We all know that we can not base the future of our energy supplies on the energy sources of the past .
8.9921	There is still too little water , wind and solar power , which is what makes it comparatively expensive .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. -RRB-
633.1341	Hence the motion for a resolution that we are tabling following a project that was started a while ago by Parliament ' s delegation to Central America , chaired by Mr Salafranca , and which we have modestly continued with during our term of office .
335.8765	Two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area , which would be beneficial to all .
5219.6347	Mr President , through this resolution we therefore wish to express our support for , and solidarity with , the Central American Parliament and also to ask the Commission to decisively support the multiannual programme which Parlacen has presented to the Commission , since we believe that , as an institution , it legitimises the process of integration in Central America and serves as a symbol of a new era of dialogue and peace .
101.3162	For the next multiannual programme , which will begin soon , we are considering an additional contribution of more than EUR 10 million in order to continue this activity .
1.4760	-LRB- B5-0863 / 2000 -RRB- by Van Hecke , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
83.5039	CÃ ´ te d'Ivoire was driven into this widespread catastrophe because it was caught in the stranglehold of its financial commitment to lend credibility to its economic prospects and the cruel and indiscriminate fallout from international trade negotiations .
19.4499	It is also vital for relations with the neighbouring countries , especially Burkina Faso , to be restored .
46.6111	In the same way , I believe that the 14 parties that have been excluded must be reintegrated and play a full part in these elections .
124.2000	Since it came into force , people of foreign extraction , and in fact we are talking in terms of a third to half of the population , have been the object of discrimination and even of attacks .
118.4021	The unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200 , which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime .
60.0605	Conversely , we refuse to associate ourselves with the representatives of political parties who were or are involved in France ' s Africa policy .
1.2514	-LRB- B5-0853 / 2000 -RRB- by Kinnock , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
81.0485	Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said that the constructive engagement approach by ASEAN in relation to Rangoon is not working .
134.2507	Mr President , Commissioner , when Thursdays arrive and we deal with the situation of human rights in the world , I am put in mind , to some extent , of what the Wailing Wall must be like .
8.5691	I believe we should have sanctions .
11.2809	Please look at imposing sanctions .
15.1303	The glass is not full in Vietnam .
6.8919	So I believe this is an important resolution .
2.8736	When it comes to saving lives , there are no bureaucratic obstacles .
798.6089	Contrary to Amendment No 1 tabled by the PSE Group , I noted in a document published on 10 November , that Human Rights Watch regards the human rights situation as being grave on quite a number of counts .
1233.4852	Firstly , with regard to Myanmar , my colleague Chris Patten has already condemned before this House the constant violations of human rights by the military regime in Burma : executions without trial , the widespread imposition of forced labour , the enforced uprooting of local populations , hundreds of political prisoners in the country ' s prisons and the clear hindering of the free functioning of political parties .
414.4908	Furthermore - and I think this should be highlighted today - within the framework of the new constitution adopted in 1992 , Vietnam has an elected national parliament , which has the duty of adopting legislation and to which the government must answer in relation to its policies .
104.4080	Commissioner , I would ask you to take note of that and to be kind enough to reply to Mr Dupuis in the appropriate form - either in writing or orally .
20.8162	We have an opportunity to make progress at The Hague in the discussions there this week and next .
71.6441	In Britain alone the estimated cost of the damage is about GBP 4 billion , only half of which is covered by insurance .
8.0736	The damage is considerable this time as well , people have died and the material damage has been enormous .
30.2845	The first will deal with the security of the energy supply and the second with a revised common transport policy .
6.0530	We now adjourn the sitting until the beginning of the vote at 5.30 p.m.
275.6559	Mr President , I am in favour of postponing the vote out of respect for the rapporteur , Mr Rocard , who specifically asked this afternoon for the vote to be deferred .
116.3404	Mr President , on behalf of rapporteur Rocard , I would like , in any case , to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 1 .
138.1790	Differences between insurance systems in individual Member States and obstacles to the free movement of people and freedom of residence in another Member State can not be used as a pretext for privatising a large part - and later all - of the health care system .
2337.2037	. -LRB- DE -RRB- We are dealing again with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which , although supplementary health insurance is a highly topical issue , is not totally endorsed by the committee or here in the plenary of the European Parliament since , after all , 12 members did not vote for it in committee .
61.6019	People who have ordinary health insurance will end up on waiting lists and receiving second-rate care , whilst those who pay extra will be able to buy the right to priority treatment and luxury .
8.8853	I regard that as major progress .
120.5353	In particular , we must ensure that there are no major differences between Basel and ourselves in relation to timescales . Otherwise the institutions concerned would just face unreasonable burdens , additional costs or competitive disadvantages .
712.7993	One can not help feeling that Parliament , following the Commission , feels obliged to align its activities with those of the Basel committee , which , let me remind you , has no legitimate right to impose its views on the Member States .
8.2911	Another positive note in this regard is that it was clearly accepted that internal bank collateral mitigates risks .
102.0499	I appreciate that the capacity of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has nothing to do with that of the European Parliament .
126.6141	In the second place , there would be a level of technical detail covering that area which will be most subject to change if we want the regulations to reflect best practice .
1377.3752	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0293 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Almeida Garrett , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the modification of Parliament ' s decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations governing performance of the Ombudsman ' s duties .
3.5091	There is no doubt that in that role the position of Ombudsman is absolutely critical .
35.4020	Only in this way can the office of Ombudsman , at EU level too , serve its important and more profound purposes .
4047.5552	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0280 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr BÃ ¶ sch , on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , on the special report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the own-initiative inquiry into the secrecy which forms part of the Commission ' s recruitment procedures -LRB- C5-0082 / 2000 - 2000/2048 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RRB- .
246.7358	I have had to do it myself from time to time , looking at scripts in Italian or German as a native English - or at least a kind of English - speaker .
0.2245	The recruitment procedures must be transparent to avoid all abuse ; that is obvious .
431.3118	The report by the Committee on Petitions states that the Committee approves the special report being discussed and , in particular , the point which states the desire to improve the impression the public gets of the institutions from our competitions procedures .
4.6543	I call for all other institutions to follow this example .
9.6058	Access to official documents by citizens of the Union is a hallmark of a responsible and fully functioning democracy .
83.7302	Mr President , I should first of all like to congratulate Mr BÃ ¶ sch on his report , to which the Commission accords a favourable response .
4.4278	That was a very satisfactory finish to a very satisfactory debate .
508.9258	Mr President , the French version of the Minutes for yesterday ' s sitting state , on page 14 , that we were to come back this morning to my request to postpone the voting on the Villiers report .
5.7172	Mr President , this is an issue of principle .
90.7167	What is totally unacceptable is for the supervisory authority - the Banca d'Italia - to have the power to establish a higher minimum requirement under certain conditions .
0.4219	Mr President , we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports .
140.2889	In so doing , we are beginning to train the next generation of police officers to work and operate throughout Europe ; in other words , we will be preparing them to implement Community law and joint and Community actions .
284.7128	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like the previous speakers , I hope that this initiative will not be seen as the umpteenth European organisation , but that people will take this initiative seriously and , as a consequence , will give it enough of a chance .
0.4033	We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points .
9.3135	You speak about establishing public order .
4.0071	We will vote for the amendments but against the legislative resolution .
1.5240	As you can probably gather , I will not be supporting this report .
7.0332	I come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situation - a civil war .
673.5291	This week , the contribution made by President De Gaulle to establishing peace in Algeria was held up by Mr Posselt as a model for the role which Mr Kostunica will have to play in order to solve the Kosovo problem .
69.3686	I should like to assure Parliament that the Commission is willing to continue to cooperate , both with regard to creating the Academy and to ensuring its smooth operation .
9.5641	Combating crime is simply a pretext .
727.8114	The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction , emphasising that this is a temporary structure , that the time period for revision must be short , and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation .
66.7523	Crucial to its operation would be the principle that a judgment made on visiting rights in one Member State is recognised throughout the EU .
382.2502	In particular , we must take account of the fact that situations sometimes occur in which the parent comes from the other side of the Union , travelling thousands of kilometres , and so it is pointless to do this for a visit limited to one hour .
4.3212	Often , couples go their separate ways in a civilised manner .
366.7641	As the House knows , the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year .
5.7273	I think if there is a fear of abduction this can be handled by having supervised visitation .
16.3459	Certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the Treaty .
5.5759	However , let us not forget that football is of crucial interest to millions of our citizens .
74.8915	This is a matter of the most obvious monopoly , that of television rights , which a certain contract has ensured will continue for a hundred years .
275.1682	Mr President , the Commission is aware of the package of measures in the road transport sector that the UK Government announced on 8 November in response to the recent oil price increases .
34.8307	I believe that this measure is certainly contrary to free trade even with the improvement that has been mentioned by the Commission .
3.3843	Mr President , with great respect I have to disagree with Mr Simpson .
15.2462	The Commission has also quite clearly ascertained that the greatest problem on the roads at present is accidents .
17.0764	I am sure the British government will be in discussion with the Commission in applying this vignette .
14.9015	The Commission should consider coming forward with proposals in order to provide for a common system throughout Europe .
28.8603	In the 1960s , you fought together , Mr Colom i Naval , for democracy in Spain .
452.0805	You are perfectly entitled to do so pursuant to Rule 18 , but it must not be thought that procedural motions have nothing to do with the specific , topical issues which the Members wish to raise at the beginning of a sitting , and it is important that Parliament should hear them .
113.8896	With good technical progress on the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and the development of a compliance system , final negotiations focused mainly on trade-offs between `` supplementarity '' and `` sinks '' .
13.5227	The EU must review its positions on the key issues and , where appropriate , make new proposals .
2288.6852	My question to the Commissioner is : Does she feel that there is any flexibility likely to arise in the European Union position on `` sinks '' ; secondly , when does she forecast that the talks are likely to resume ; and thirdly , was Mr Prescott ' s statement to the House of Commons actually true ?
695.4272	Madam President , these negotiations were always going to be hard but Commission officials believed that a deal would be done at the end of the day because political leaders across the world simply had too much to lose by returning home empty-handed .
5.9404	Progress was also made in the field of enforcement .
46.1507	Only if equality is incorporated will the developing countries start to participate in the fight against climate change after 2012 .
904.5780	It is important for Europe to stick with a position taken up previously , even though it means that the United States will not be in a position to subscribe to an agreement of this kind for the period of the Bush administration .
371.2396	It has already been said that the next meeting to discuss the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will take place in Bonn , which will coincide with a publication by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change .
138.5832	The intransigence of the European Union , led by the French Minister for the Environment , Mrs Voynet , stood in the way of a potential agreement .
213.6202	Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let us not beat about the bush , the climate conference in The Hague was a flop , which is disappointing because it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change is happening much faster than anticipated .
0.2092	Clearly , however , there are many losers following a conference of this kind .
125.2367	Madam President , we knew that this COPÂVI would be of particularly great importance : it represented abandoning the stage of discussion in which we had been stuck since 1992 and moving on towards action .
8.5127	This is only the start .
9.8061	We now know what kind of questions we will have on the table for this last part .
291.1376	There are some very important items on the agenda but even so they far from reflect all the work that has been done and all the results that have already been obtained during the last six months .
11.0542	The role of the European Parliament is naturally one of the important elements in the debate .
4.9881	There too , a solution will have to be found at Nice .
17.0015	First , the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
56.1901	I hope we can profit from it even more in the future , notably by opening it up to other European countries .
276.8847	The European Council will thus be informed of the state of progress of the negotiations on the directive on the information and consultation of workers , and on the European company project , assuming these issues have not already been settled by then , as unfortunately they are running into persistent opposition .
22.7793	Madam President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , next week the European Council meets in Nice .
108.9633	This is a subject I would like to dwell on for a moment , because the House made a point of highlighting it on today 's agenda .
47.8138	But this means that the right of codecision must also apply to fundamental matters of European agricultural policy , where majority decision-making already exists .
68.7991	Then we will even be able to discuss - as suggested by President Chirac in the Bundestag , not here - the European Constitution .
902.4597	I should like to say , with regard to a number of the specific points , that my group believes that , at this stage of evolution of the European Union , having one national for each Member State of the Commission still remains a sensible proposition and enhances the legitimacy of the Union .
2.0915	However , it is important at this stage to discuss what is to happen post-Nice .
7.3696	The moment of truth is approaching in Nice .
70.4869	Another avenue must be explored , one that is more flexible and more respectful of the decisions of each Member State : the avenue of ` differentiated cooperation ' .
120.9047	The powers to be given to the EU by the Treaty of Nice treaty go beyond those exercised at federal level in many federal States .
339.2024	The federalists can achieve their desire for more integration , and the governments in Sweden , Great Britain and Denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions , binding in practice , have been taken .
34.3355	In view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro , people need to see that we are taking steps forward .
10.3931	Mr Poettering condemned the responsibilities of parties on all sides .
3.5036	Perhaps we should shift the focus to the issue of extending codecision with the Parliament .
101.2696	In my view , the most important thing to do at the Nice Summit is to set a timetable for when and how the EU is to become ready for enlargement .
16.2164	The stadium is now in sight .
10.6490	-LRB- Applause from the right and centre -RRB-
64.2287	In order to make room for the newcomers , all Member States need to move a little closer together , but they only do so when they really can not put off the evil moment any longer .
96.8800	I have this to say to the Heads of Governments : making concessions at the forthcoming summit is not a political defeat but a political triumph : the triumph of the new Europe over the old .
92.9574	Having said this , in my opinion , Nice needs to be an historic Council , for ourselves , our nations and the very future of Europe .
85.7511	In order to ensure that the institutions operate more efficiently , we called for Council decisions to be taken by qualified majority rather than unanimously , although we did , of course , exclude all issues of constitutional significance .
51.1664	Mr President , the EU summit at Nice will hopefully be a further positive step on the road to European integration .
8.1878	Every government is saying we need more qualified majority voting , but they all have their list of exceptions .
3.6654	If this is working here let us make it work across the whole spectrum of legislation .
20.6141	The common foreign policy needs to be fully integrated into Community procedure because only then shall we have the necessary safety valves .
5.8710	I do not believe that failure is an option .
0.3011	I would warn our Heads of Government against taking an over-minimalist stance in Nice .
269.5437	I feel it is also up to the Council to try to act not just for the sake of national interests but also for the sake of the common European interest , because united we stand , divided we fall , and we had better not forget it .
27.5333	I venture to doubt whether consensus will be easier to achieve in the new extended family than it is now .
549.1984	I definitely intend to pass on the information to the President of the Republic , who will be chairing the Nice European Council , the Prime Minister , and my colleagues on the General Affairs Council next Monday .
7.0635	We have to take it into account .
7.8463	The same applies to qualified majority voting issues .
120.7768	I would further stress that the Commission 's determination will target not only the points we have just discussed but also the consideration and the attention that will be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
432.7223	I wish to refer to the disgraceful demonstration that took place in the Foreign Affairs Committee of this Parliament yesterday morning when the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs was involved in discussions with us .
8.7543	It was a dangerous situation .
58.3451	She was unfortunate enough to utter a few words in the Kurdish language before coming to her national tongue , which is German .
80.9203	Based on the findings of this report , the President will not hesitate to take the required measures and also to involve the organs of this Parliament that need to be involved , such as the quaestors or the Bureau , for example .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
256.8032	Mr President , when Mr Gorostiaga uses the word `` dialogue '' in his tribute to the murdered Ernest Lluch , he is insulting his memory and insulting the ideas for which ETA murdered him .
0.6565	The next item is the joint debate on two reports and two oral questions :
26.0029	The problems do not lie with them , but rather in the institutional ramifications , and we must try to keep such problems to an absolute minimum .
5917.6103	I already know the vote will not be unanimous and that is not surprising , because this is difficult ground where differing political options are expressed on the role of the European Union as opposed to that of its Member States , on the place of the soldier as opposed to the civilian , on the place of the European Union as opposed to NATO and the United States , on the role of the European Union in the world and the choice it has to make between pacifism and non-intervention , on the one hand , and the will to deal with crises , on the other .
103.1978	Within the limits of operational security even the US Senate and House are closely involved with the operations of the Department of Defence .
31.8662	The mechanism created as a result of these decisions will be complemented by establishing procedures for crisis management and the establishment of an operations centre in the Secretariat-General .
6.7773	This applies to the actions of the traditional Member State administrations as well as to the specialist agencies .
1077.4740	Our policy is quite clear : we want , on the basis of principles of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and the market economy , to provide the most useful incentives and support for the huge changes undertaken by Russia , for it to become , eventually - and it will take as long as necessary - a great country , which is developing , which is modernising at every level and which is peace-loving , in short , the kind of country that we would be happy to have as our neighbour .
532.4485	We decided to work on the content of our policy towards North Korea and , on 20 November , we adopted guidelines for that country and the European troika has been able to visit North Korea on the basis of this approach .
576.4664	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as I speak to you today , I am aware of taking part in a key turning point in the life of Europe , because this is , I think , the first time that a Minister of Defence has addressed your Parliament .
9.9387	We also now have a catalogue of forces that records the voluntary contributions of each Member State .
23.0265	Our fifteen nations have set themselves the target of making this Force operational , I repeat , by 2003 .
28.2360	A Japanese-American political scientist wrote a book with the unhappy title of `` The End of History '' in 1989 .
93.0847	In the recent history of Bosnia , we saw a situation in which some of our soldiers were very often put in intolerable positions , not just militarily but morally as well .
152.9219	On crisis management , the Commission adopted on 27 September a draft decision on the establishment of a Community mechanism for coordination of civil protection interventions in emergency situations .
190.9924	Mr President , Mr Brok has made it perfectly clear what our group thinks of the progress achieved in the field of defence and of the distance that still needs to be covered here .
74.6729	We do not rule out the possibility of increasing defence expenditure , but that will have to be assessed on its own merits , also in line with other priorities , for example in the social and economic field .
132.4497	Naturally , the EU must take increased responsibility for conflict-prevention measures , crisis management , peacekeeping operations etc in the immediate vicinity of the European Union .
6.4349	Last summer ' s so-called Solana decision was criticised vociferously in this Chamber .
8.0529	I have a very specific question for Mr Richard on that score .
94.5839	Let us simply repeat what Mrs Mary Robinson said to the UN Commissioner for human rights : not more , but not less .
132.7384	Then , and only then , will it have a chance to overcome its impotence in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean region .
24.7388	Furthermore , as the French Minister for Defence pointed out , there has been progress in the field of defence policy .
92.7093	There is , however , a European level of security policy , and the European Parliament acts as a budgetary authority for security expenditure at that level .
84.6864	Yet the Union would be unrivalled in that domain if only it would improve the existing instruments and especially its present potential for civilian conflict prevention and apply them coherently .
15.6422	Civilian conflict prevention , and I stress the word ` prevention ' , can not be a mere appendage of military intervention .
1009.5245	I believe , Mr President , that if you were to ask the public for their opinion , you would find that they think we deal with foreign policy and security here in the European Parliament , and that this is also where the centre of gravity of our decision-making power lies , which is not the case .
831.7131	Fifthly , the United Nations should be asked to convene a world peace summit , at which lessons can be drawn from the wars of the twentieth century so that the peoples of this earth will be offered the prospect of a peaceful twenty-first century .
19.9221	Firstly , a key factor must be to maintain the consistency of the European Union 's external policy .
13.3150	It is an exciting debate we are having this evening .
4.6346	I am very proud however of the Irish agreement and the Irish contribution .
118.3069	Millions of dollars were promised and then given to the Taliban to enable them to remove , to pull up their opium crops : they pocketed the money and then promptly more than doubled their drugs production .
356.5316	EU policy must always be based on the partnership approach which seeks to share NATO assets , particularly planning and intelligence as well as hardware , rather than duplicate the structures of NATO , particularly when we share common objectives .
298.6621	On the question of duplication , let me point out that the resources , the military assets the nations have freely accepted to provide for this joint force , are the same capabilities most of these nations make available to the Atlantic Alliance .
353.3040	As a result , public opinion and our parliaments , including this one , will begin to give deeper political thought to the issues involved in resolving crises by a whole range of means , of which armed force is but one component .
29.2324	The need for reform is beyond doubt and the Commission must become a first-class administration in the service of our political objective .
6.4025	The recruitment procedure must always guarantee equal opportunities to all EU nationals .
6.5147	We are very much in favour of that .
153.1350	But looking at the four reports as a whole , this period of consultation has allowed us to take both a broader and a closer view , which has increased the value of Parliament 's opinion .
33.1815	As the committee with responsibility for budgetary control , I highlight in the report approved by the committee the aspects of the reform concerning competence in this area .
6.7339	The Court of Auditors also says that , on the express condition that the role of the contractor ...
331.8130	In the short time this evening I do not have time to go through all our specific recommendations in detail , so I want to centre on what I think is the key element of how these reforms must move forward .
2.7520	A further document on the subject is being prepared by the Commission .
296.7497	The Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the Union 's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies , and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service .
1.7966	My group does not reject the idea of this proposal on early retirement being obligatory .
382.8076	Second , the setting up of a financial irregularities help-desk or panel as proposed in the White Paper is acceptable to my group only if it can be shown that such a help-desk will in no way undermine the ability of OLAF to do its work .
3.6132	If there is more than one decision-maker , nobody clearly bears the responsibility .
1903.9570	The implementation of the budget is another area in which the Commission - and Parliament too , for that matter - must consider in future what to do about the problem of backlogs , how to ensure that we start to address the question of budgetary commitments in the implementation of new programmes too , so that we do not always have this huge discrepancy between commitments and payments .
46.5722	Commissioner Kinnock is trying , by changing and improving the rules , to give the Commission officials an enhanced sense of responsibility .
115.5262	The experts , as such , are specialists , but the legislator can not be either their obedient servant or another expert : he must hear , consult , reflect and then produce on his own initiative , or else he may as well give up politics and leave law-making to the experts .
63.5591	Amendment No 23 looks like it was an afterthought and while we are not against it , it should not replace the existing Paragraph 22 .
55.7421	That goal is enlargement and it is extremely difficult to achieve but we look to the Commission to be the driving force and we want to work alongside it .
20.9897	The European public ' s confidence was shaken and it is much more difficult to regain this now .
95.3641	It will only be possible to achieve results for the citizens if the Commission is able to act swiftly and transparently , and be accountable to this public service , among other things .
316.6429	Let us open a new book on a modern European public service that fulfils its constitutional role in the proper manner , is ready for the forthcoming enlargement and lastly , which embraces service provision for the European public as its new mission statement .
5.8359	The more power you have over an issue , the later it comes in the night .
244.9796	The provision of external channels will be a major and progressive change , which I am certain will work to the benefit of the institutions and their staff , the European Union and , of course , the public interest .
0.2290	The main focal point of the reform is the effort to improve financial management .
482.4398	Incidentally , I am delighted to note , Mrs Guy-Quint , that you are a specialist in this field who can be relied upon to debate the recast Financial Regulation in Parliament with competence and no doubt with passion too .
9.1178	Thank you very much , Commissioner .
11.4053	We fear that the origin of the absurdity lies in the internal debate within the Commission regarding who is who .
19.8379	First let me remind you of a few statistics , to avoid any complexes about our current activities .
3.4478	We want to see increased accountability for the public service and we want to see decentralisation .
3.3938	We often talk about cancelling the debt of the less developed countries .
4.0000	Let us give him the political responsibility to do the job .
24.3161	. Chairman , this debate is timely as the Commission has in fact taken important steps , new steps in the reform of external relations .
152.9518	Even if that reform were clearly insufficient , and this is beyond any discussion today , it did in fact lay the basis for a number of the changes which we are now pushing forward .
27461.0794	Report -LRB- A5-0343 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Watts , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement , in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States , of international standards for ship safety , pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions -LRB- port state control -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 142 - C5-0174 / 2000 - 2000/0065 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB-
572.2074	Personally , I want to tell you , ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , that the fact that we are examining these proposals today is living proof that the European Parliament is an effective institution , which can take on board the concerns of our citizens speedily and effectively .
96.0951	Indeed , citizens have the right to expect that ships are safe and that they can transport their cargo in an environmentally acceptable way without endangering the life and economy of people living on nearby coasts .
3012.7540	Finally , I wish to thank this House and in particular the rapporteurs , Mr Hatzidakis , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , Ms McKenna and Mr Watts , for their understanding of the importance of the first ` Erika ' package which is evidenced by the excellent work already done in such a limited time , and for the generally good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the field of maritime safety .
4.5065	We want black boxes in all ships as soon as possible .
253.3408	Not that this is a panacea , of course , as we saw with the Ievoli Sun , which was a new , double-hull vessel , from which we must conclude that this measure alone is not enough .
17.0414	In this respect , there is a commitment to improving the quality of vessel inspections as a measure to prevent maritime accidents .
2.1495	This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution .
3.3338	The definition of accidental marine pollution includes a reference to munitions dumping .
403.9615	Nor let us forget , as Mrs McKenna said , that a large percentage of marine pollution is due to practices coyly described as ` operational ' , that is , tank cleaning and other deliberate spills , against which the arsenal of deterrents must be intensified .
75.7053	I can therefore only ask you to accept the directive and the regulation in the form in which Parliament adopts them at noon today .
86.8217	I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points .
191.8702	We must send out a clear signal to unsafe flag states , to shipowners , including those from the EU who use these flag states , to shippers who can then get cheaper prices , and to classification societies that are not doing their job properly .
17.7807	This oil cake symbolises the enormous amount of work we have to do to make our seas cleaner and maritime transport safer .
328.0300	The Hatzidakis report , whilst banning single-hull oil tankers on the same dates as the American bans , nevertheless introduces a whole raft of exemptions which do not go in the desired direction , notably with the proposal to extend the deadlines for the phasing-out of single-hull vessels .
750.4505	Mrs de Palacio recalled a few days ago in Rennes that , in less than a year , the United States was able to unilaterally put in place a draconian law regarding maritime safety .
69.3683	What I would ask though , is what percentage of the ships should be refused at the present time on the basis of these criteria ?
88.8762	No one in the Council of which you are the Chairman should be tempted to accuse of us of moving too slowly ; we demand some minimums and everyone will understand that .
11.8253	Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their sterling work .
3.6038	These countries must make the necessary resources available , people must be trained and so on .
4.7892	Our political action must be powerful and commensurate with ecological urgency .
45.9242	I am convinced , however , that it is vitally important in the context of maritime accidents to consider the whole chain of responsibility and to examine every aspect of the matter .
27.8510	I would also like to point out that it is not enough that the Union alone should find solutions to increase safety at sea .
12.0043	The Erika catastrophe in autumn 1999 caused many to react , which is a good thing .
183.2467	Proposals have been made to prohibit ships which seriously endanger our seas from docking , to record voyage data so that conditions along a ship 's course can be checked in the event of an accident , to gradually make double hulls compulsory and to improve regulations and standards governing ship inspection and control bodies .
12.9902	Ladies and gentlemen , let us ensure that the `` polluter pays '' slogan does not remain just a slogan !
0.4080	Allow me to make a comment on Portugal , which has been mentioned here .
514.1289	Like my very good friend Mrs Langenhagen I am very worried about the situation in South Korea and I was glad to see that the European Commission will review this issue before May next year .
1.7874	It is true that the subjects we are dealing with are sometimes complex and technical .
3.0819	I would like to start with the proposal on port state control .
18.4563	This is not reflected in the text of the directive where the refusal of access only concerns EU ports .
33.0121	Amendment No 12 of the report says exactly the same , but it is more of a political commitment than a legal text .
255.7672	This is why the Commission would favour Amendment No 28 now on the table which reintroduces the obligation for Member States to carry out their assessment and therefore rejects Amendment No 13 .
26.8918	I have two comments on issues raised by Mr Stenmarck about oil spills in the Baltic Sea .
7.6315	Thank you , Mrs WallstrÃ ¶ m .
6.1487	The vote will take place in a few moments .
17.0478	Motion for a resolution on the preparation of the Nice European Council
0.2090	If the author of the amendment agrees , we could proceed in that way .
4321.3999	Report -LRB- A5-0326 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Harbour , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the White Paper on reforming the Commission -LRB- aspects concerning the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 0200 - C5-0446 / 2000 - 2000/2216 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB-
100.0591	I have talked to retired seamen , who tell me that they are all in favour of this programme , especially because it is a European programme aimed at keeping the seas clean .
10.2336	We need to change the system of shipping registers by moving them from the private to the public sector .
138.5122	It is significant that Mrs Vachetta has proposed that the level of manpower , the working hours , the pay levels and the training of sailors should be improved .
1.9131	We therefore call on the Member States to make a real commitment to maritime safety .
1.7764	Double-hull tankers reduce the risk of oil pollution , but do not rule it out .
9.2167	In short , what is being proposed is to eliminate the lack of maritime safety without attacking its causes .
268.0838	. The Erika and other recent oil spills form a continuing catalogue of disasters that have taken place in Community waters , including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress of Wales .
596.2502	Oil tanker traffic in the Baltic may now increase dramatically , since Russia is planning a number of oil ports along the Baltic coast , in the Gulf of Finland , in something approaching a major concentration of the Russian oil industry .
6.7299	The quality of our environment is at stake .
90.6663	It is a step in the right direction that the recognition accorded classification societies can be withdrawn , that liability is to be harmonised and that classification societies will always have to transfer their data to the competitor who takes over from them .
27.3916	In particular , we reject calls for a European constitution , at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions .
13.7918	- -LRB- SV -RRB- We are voting in favour of the resolution , but we wish to comment on the following points :
85.3660	That must not stop us , the people of the European Union , from seeking this justice in the here and now , here on earth .
155.6393	It now remains to make a success of the Nice Summit and , as regards institutional reform , to persuade each of you to make the final concessions needed to achieve ' a good agreement ' and a good Treaty .
230.8416	. As a Member of Parliament representing Ireland I am deeply disappointed with the wording of the resolution which has just been adopted by this House on the 2000 Nice European Council .
390.6283	The EU , within the framework of NATO , will take part in imposing a new world order which has little sympathy for the fate of the Palestinians and which is preparing to effectively endorse the liberalisation of rail transport and postal services .
43.1046	On the other hand , the so-called reforms proposed by the Nice Summit resolution make little sense to anyone in the world beyond Brussels .
0.3837	Need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote ?
69.5649	. -LRB- SV -RRB- I welcome the aim to ease the enlargement process at the Conference of the European Council in Nice .
4.2395	Nor can we support the conversion of the Community ' s delegations into EU embassies .
36.9321	The truth is that , far removed from the virtual visions which hold sway within this Parliament , diplomatic realities are entirely different and the CFSP hardly exists .
8.9687	' he told me .
3.9169	. -LRB- FR -RRB- We have naturally voted against this report .
38.1231	We feel that civil crisis management is a valuable instrument for preventing conflicts , something which we must unfortunately state has not been given sufficient attention in the report .
30.6048	Workers have nothing to gain and everything to lose from this ` new ' imperial design of the European Union .
7.7214	I therefore can not support the report .
48.8060	The talk about being ` united in diversity ' rings hollow , especially for the non-aligned Member States , if only parts of the content of the reports are put into practice .
5.3374	A teacher marking such a piece of work would write `` Does not answer the question '' .
24.8684	Whilst I fully recognise and support the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution , I must sadly vote against this rather confused report .
0.2015	However , I am not very comfortable with some of the wording in it .
8.3677	There is great demand for domestic help .
47.7950	Finally , she wants Member States to link the issuing of visas for domestic employees working for diplomats to be linked to a guaranteed minimum level of working conditions .
28.0654	It is just a fear : I am sure he will not do so , but I should like to emphasise this anyway on behalf of pensioners .
0.8379	Madam President , I voted in favour of the PomÃ © s Ruiz report .
704.1163	The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , however , forcefully recalls that , as regards staff recruitment , the Commission reform must take account of the diversity of opinions and beliefs which are expressed in our countries regarding Europe , its past and its future .
49.5589	The Commission should execute : it should be the executive power of the European Union ; Parliament should be the legislative power .
10.1285	This is absolutely essential !
7.9955	I shall try to clarify the position .
1.4357	Madam President , some of us were , of course , at the same meeting .
8.6614	So I am in favour of postponing the resolution until January .
126.6812	We have only just discovered that this text is not available , at least for the time being , but it might be in the next few hours .
19.6593	Madam President , we voted on 4 December .
7.5372	Does anyone from that group wish to support this request ?
5.2515	I will see what I can do about that .
875.4535	Legislative procedures do not take place in a vacuum ; as the negotiations for the framework agreement on tobacco control in the World Health Organisation have shown , there is a worldwide trend towards increasingly far-reaching control of what the World Health Organisation refers to as the tobacco epidemic .
384.0104	If this can be settled in a legally conclusive manner by adding a reference to the legal basis of Article 133 of the Treaty then I feel we should all support this solution , and I would also hope that by so doing , we will not encounter annulment rights at a later stage .
177.5098	To ditch , as someone has proposed , all this work and with it the opportunity to send a positive message to the citizens is , of course , a valid proposal , but at least let us have the courage to do it in the name of an explicit political reason and not hide behind formal homage to the Treaty .
738.5398	Fifty thousand deaths a year for decades , due to the consequences of using a drug with known side-effects for which doctors and hospital departments know there is only palliative treatment , and nothing is done apart from a few timid information campaigns .
3.0206	We have a positive opinion of the contents of the report and support its main points .
67.2498	That attitude perfectly sums up the defects of our European institutions , always ready to go to any lengths to achieve the ideological goals they have set themselves .
113.4904	Tobacco consumption is discouraged on the one hand , yet on the other , in excess of EUR 1 billion is spent on tobacco subsidies annually .
324.1048	The Commissioner today , for the first time , in his very brief intervention , has used the words `` no doubt '' at least three times and the words `` clear '' or `` clearly '' at least three times .
1479.5354	This judgment has several questionable aspects but , accepting the judgment as it stands - since we have no choice , given that the court of Justice is the highest body qualified to interpret Community law - there is nothing to prevent this Parliament from declaring itself in favour of the proposed legal basis of Article 95 with Article 133 , and introducing the amendments to which I have referred , which include the rapporteur ' s amendments .
103.8786	Parliament should no longer be deluded in this matter ; it should understand that it is now vital to show support for Mr Maaten ' s excellent report .
839.9698	Amendments approved by our committee were to increase the size of the general warnings such as `` smoking kills '' , on the front of cigarette packages from 25 to 30 % and to increase the size of additional warnings on cigarette packages from 25 to 40 % .
5.8336	It is a classic symptom of political correctness gone mad .
154.0319	It is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest .
15.4669	As a relatively new Member of this House it struck me how strong the forces against this directive are in this Parliament .
8.9790	This does not help anyone to achieve their objectives because production is not reduced , it is just moved .
13.2516	Only where these terms are part of registered trademarks which are already marketed could consideration be given to granting derogations .
6.3945	I therefore urge you to support this compromise package .
40.1747	People change from one type of cigarette to another under the false assumption that the ` light ' cigarette is safer for their health .
929.4575	In answer to the question on exports that Mr Bowis asked me earlier , it is quite clear that , in the unlikely event that the aspect of the directive that refers to exports is challenged and if the view of the Court - which I do not predict - is that it is not supported by the legal basis , it is clearly severable from the directive .
834.1936	I do not agree with that view for two reasons : firstly , this would run counter to the concept of harmonisation , which is the justification for using Article 95 as the basis ; secondly , even if Member States wanted to advertise in this way , it does not require any sanction or authorisation by legislation at EU level to do so .
27.8968	Thus , the amendments that the Commission has accepted will make this a much improved text and take account of the main concerns expressed by Members .
101.7545	In view of the changes that we will very likely be undergoing , it would not be a very good idea to introduce permanent arrangements now , with no opportunity for a review .
0.9001	The first report will be drafted by 30 April 2007 , at the latest .
345.4896	The dates for starting and ending summer time were harmonised , finally , a few years ago so that they have been the same in all the Member States of the EU since 1996 .
131.7766	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as the darkest time of the year approaches it is heartening to speak of summer , or even summer time .
1205.6841	While these are all reasons militating in favour of adopting open-ended arrangements , as a precaution the Commission has made provision for drawing up , no later than five years after the first year of application of the directive , a report based on information supplied by each Member State .
32.7144	Positions here in Parliament were very far apart , but they were equally divergent between the Member States and the different institutions .
32.1468	Children 's metabolisms have particular characteristics , which is why medicines which are administered to children also need to be tested on children in clinical trials .
140.8267	Madam President , I would like to join Mrs Patrie in warmly thanking our rapporteur , Mr Liese , for all his efforts to find a consensus .
11.3997	It was only , in my view , this amendment , tabled by us , that made this important debate possible .
114.1637	Current differences between the laws , regulations and administrative provisions in the Member States are creating obstacles to and competition between pharmaceutical companies in their bid to make new drugs quickly available to patients .
7.6263	But I was keen to hear whether the Council could accept it , if that were perhaps possible .
945.8293	So that is what we have agreed ; we have agreed that the two programmes which expire in December 2001 will be extended for one year and we have also agreed on the amount , which is the same , in fact it is slightly less than the amount which the European Commission originally requested .
270.5636	For example , even if the fight against AIDS is not fashionable , it still needs to be a priority because this tragic disease remains very present , particularly in the future candidate countries .
188.9767	The Irish Government runs a very successful programme called `` The Young People Facilities and Services Fund '' which supports the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas .
849.7246	I thank Parliament , particularly the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and , above all , the rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , for the great efforts made to ensure that this proposal can be adopted in one reading and in record time .
485.3161	In this matter , we simply have to remember , for example , that in 1997 , within the European Union , more than 200 million people crossed the borders of their State of residence into the territory of other Member States .
2016.9384	For this reason , the Citizens ' Europe will not make sense unless we first adopt , amongst others , the necessary measures to improve and also take account of the rights of victims of crime , aimed in a global sense at safeguarding all their rights and interests , on the one hand , and , from a Community point of view , at harmonising the legislation of the 15 Member States on the other .
453.5089	The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with the rapporteur 's view that this recorded evidence was not a suitable instrument in a State under the rule of law and therefore deleted video recordings from the relevant paragraph of the article concerned .
39.0074	It is crucial that there should be a legal instrument that enables national legislation in the various Member States on the victim ' s status to be harmonised .
49.4778	By adopting this report , the European Union is giving an initial response to a call for justice which has hitherto been disregarded .
281.2116	The study carried out by An Weghers within the framework of the Grotius programme provides the necessary basic information to this end . The useful information available in certain Member States concerning existing measures could play an important part in the harmonisation of a common package of measures .
84.2778	So , together with the euro , I also welcome the advent of the statute for the victims of crime , so that a genuine European area of justice can be built .
6.8729	I can not support this sort of trend .
5.0639	The Commission does not have any objection to the majority of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur .
231.1399	At this stage , it is perhaps preferable to bring about a working relationship with the services for victim support , rather than putting in a text the principle of a ` green number ' , which would be likely to have no future .
9.7052	Are there any comments ?
37.5595	Moreover , as I said before , I hope that we will be able to vote on this proposal during the January part-session .
4.9195	As the elected representatives of the people , we parliamentarians have acted in accordance with this proverb .
8.8778	We now expect the Commission to start work at soon as possible .
1.9930	I should like to have responded to long-term requirements with proper multiannual planning .
464.7075	I think that we are on the right path and , as part of the budgetary authority - in this case as the budgetary authority because the Council does not play the most decisive role here - we shall help to ensure that this continues in the future .
6.6993	Here the thing that we are not allowed to mention is ` revision of the financial perspective . '
290.5445	I am thinking specifically here of research , the Trans-European Networks and culture or audiovisual creation , with the MEDIA Plus programme , on which an agreement was concluded on 23 November .
588.7678	The credit for this result , which is proof of the priority given by the European Union to the development of small and medium-sized businesses and to employment must be given to your rapporteur , Jutta Haug , who is in the Chamber today .
766.2702	Mobilising the flexibility instrument , which is one of the key innovations of the 1999 agreement , has therefore enabled us to conclude an agreement on the funding of the European Union ' s external actions in 2001 , whilst taking account of factors that may occur along the way .
558.9986	I can assure you that the Council ' s objective , throughout this budgetary procedure , has been to produce a budget for 2001 that will enable the European Union to respond to the crises that affect it within Europe itself but also those occurring beyond its borders .
222.3910	I should like at this point to take the opportunity to thank Mr Kouchner for his splendid work in Kosovo ; we were also able to provide huge support here from our budgetary resources .
403.7961	The procedure for the flexibility instrument was laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the purpose , in exceptional cases , of funding specific expenditure over and above the ceilings agreed in Berlin , without calling the financial perspective into question .
63.3654	I have two comments to make in connection with the document now on the table , and these are directed at the Council and the Commission .
5.5892	This must shortly find expression - as is clear from the debate - in the multiannual programme .
5.1330	The amount for the common fisheries policy is scarcely 1 % of the Community budget .
479.6875	Turning to that for a moment , we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by Mrs Schreyer , preferably before 30 June , so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget .
1.6338	It shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them .
459.5839	Repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the Interinstitutional Agreement , because it was an instrument which this European Parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to EUR 600 million .
5.8531	We wanted to secure the EU 's ability to act and the confidence of the people .
37.6983	I am also aware that this outcome certainly owes a great deal to the contribution made by the European Parliament .
1752.2787	In deciding to abolish a second Commissioner , and in deciding on a varying upper limit for the number of Commissioners when there are less than 27 , with a scrupulously fair system of rotation , the Treaty of Nice guarantees both the Commission ' s task of embodying the interests of the Union and also its effectiveness .
39.7044	This therefore provides us with a guarantee that Europe will be able , no matter what happens , to forge ahead rapidly .
173.2554	Thirty new chapters were closed , including some in the most complex areas of Community legislation , and some countries , which have only just entered into negotiations , are already demonstrating their ability to catch up with the longer-standing candidates .
9.1104	I realise how much importance your Parliament attaches to this Charter .
47.1128	Over the last few months , the study of the Commission ' s excellent proposals has made considerable progress .
7.7424	The Member States then committed themselves to providing a contribution in terms of armed forces and military resources .
155.2366	Here , however , in this Chamber , on my own behalf , on behalf of the French Prime Minister and Government , I wish first and foremost to thank this House for its contribution .
193.2561	Moving on to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of Nice , I would first of all like to pay heartfelt tribute to Michel Barnier for his work .
55.6354	and secondly because it has made the decision-making process even more complex , which runs counter to the legibility and transparency for which the citizens are calling .
284.5377	For the European Parliament , which was the winner in Amsterdam , there has been no increase in codecision by the European Parliament and this is one of the great failings of the Nice Summit .
267.8626	If we want the Union to reflect the interests of all of its Member States and all of its peoples as a community of values , according to the Community method , the institutions that can guarantee this are the Commission and Parliament , acting within the framework of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
3439.3946	After nine months , more than 330 hours of preparation in formal sessions , thousands of hours of preparation surrounding those sessions , it ended up in the spectacle of the extraordinary difficulty of the negotiators being stuck at the end still having to try to resolve everything because in all that had gone before , nothing of substance had been decided .
19.2755	We would then have sent the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe a signal of incalculable political consequences .
266.8696	Speaking mainly on behalf of the French members of my group , I will say that there is a permanent contradiction between the virtues attributed to this Europe and the aberrations seen in the daily workings of the Union .
9.6271	The final result is preposterous .
59.5985	We are told of parity between the larger States but the division is confirmed with 27 additional seats being allocated to just one country .
128.6899	However , what is worrying in this situation , and this is something which both I and Mr Poettering have warned against , is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation may be used as a circumvention strategy in areas in which no decision can be reached by a qualified majority .
686.0536	Not counting certain irresponsible troublemakers who , of course , turned up with intentions which had nothing to do with the progress of human thought , there was indeed excellent and extensive participation , for which the European Confederation of Trade Unions was largely responsible .
185.7813	Not because I am opposed to the proposals in principle but because I want to safeguard the compromise with the Council and avoid risking a complicated and tricky conciliation procedure for the sake of an amendment .
3.0853	Two-thirds of children ' s medicines were in fact designed for adults .
233.2993	I welcome the agreement to continue to begin summer time on the last Sunday in March and to end it on the last Sunday in October .
11084.2000	You are going to be surprised , Mr President , for this time , before I left for Strasbourg , it was Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the tourist who said to Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the MEP - we talk to each other sometimes in the mirror - `` Seeing as you are going to debate the issue of the protection of victims , remember that last year I went to Spain on holiday and , when I got out my wallet in front of the Sagrada Familia to make a donation in order to make my humble contribution to the conclusion of the work on this structure , both wallet and all the documents inside disappeared .
1312.9640	I believe we have adequate protection for such victims under Article 6 of the Council of Europe 's Convention on Human Rights , and this report is yet another example of unnecessary proposed European interference into an area which is already covered by agreements between Member States , as well as 25 other non-EU members of the Council of Europe .
3.5014	the statement by the officiating President of the Council on the French Presidency .
9.8999	The results were heartbreaking .
15.9232	The candidates can not have been pleased at the sight of the scramble for national power and status among the prime ministers .
3.1897	It reads , ` Everyone is equal , but some are more equal than others . '
62.5910	For the fact is that what has been decided in Nice is enhanced cooperation , superpower domination , a Charter of Fundamental Rights , military development and the monitoring of democracy .
14.8922	This method has seen its heyday , this system of a Europe of chancelleries is on its last legs .
2939.3545	In response to President Chirac , we are not calling for haste ; we are asking not to have to take one step forwards and then one backwards , not to call for promotion of the drafting and proclamation of the Charter when we do not then dare to include it in the Treaty , not to call for the new wording of the Convention to be produced when we then do not even dare to suggest it as a potential post-Nice procedure .
318.8045	Terrified of jeopardising France 's equal voting rights with Germany , the Presidency docilely allowed its proposals to extend qualified majority voting to 40 or so subjects to be knocked down to less than half this number .
3.3606	We know we should think about Europe differently and we know we need new institutions .
6.7781	That is my main criticism of you .
11.7090	Only those who have always believed in the strategic value of enlargement have a genuine right to rejoice with them .
1.1237	Only the Belgian Head of Government , Mr Verhofstadt , was a notable exception .
172.4209	Given the procedure described , new proposals for the Europe of tomorrow need to be drafted by political and social bodies - mainly the national parliaments and the European Parliament .
65.9785	I think confidence in Europe would have been shaken in economic terms , and operationally we would have lost several years of ground .
7.1070	A safety net of Member States : any qualified majority must include a majority of the Member States .
27.1623	One can understand that Heads of State and Government are preoccupied with the sensitivities of their own public opinions and Parliaments .
6.0435	Therefore , my first words should be to thank Mr Prodi , who has stayed .
59.7398	Now that we have a population criterion in there anyway , it should have been possible to lower the threshold in terms of the number of votes .
7.8094	No reform of the common agricultural policy , no reform of the development policies which are vastly wasteful .
21.8770	These are challenges that can not be overcome , Mr President of the Commission , with our backs to the people .
377.5481	But I think that we should not do so until we have a clear and unequivocal promise from the Council as to how the process will operate from now on , i.e. with the close involvement of the European Parliament .
234.7082	Beyond the technical aspects of that reform , what concerns us most of all is the growing difficulty the Member States of the European Union have in making joint decisions , in accordance with the common interests of their citizens .
213.5096	We must surely agree with him , although we know that this desire will only be able to be realised after many years have passed , if , as I believe will happen , national parliaments ratify the Treaty of Nice .
3.1630	'' `` We can not get this through the House of Commons .
5.4218	Thank you very much , Mr President of the Commission .
2051.6185	In total , with about 1.09 % of European gross domestic product , or even less , the 2001 budget will be one of the lowest of the last ten years , in relative terms , since it is well below the already very restrictive ceiling established under Agenda 2000 in Berlin in March 1999 .
3.1486	An agreement has just been concluded in Nice to make enlargement possible .
341.3323	We are also aware of the assumption behind the Commission 's Letter of Amendment No. 2 , i.e. that around 900 million can be saved in Category I. However , this assumption no longer holds true .
363.2663	The Commission 's original proposal for a revision of the financial perspective to take EUR 300 million from category 1 for category 4 was a worthy idea : worthy of support and eminently sensible .
135.7423	There are times when I foolishly assumed this year that once the Commission had made its proposals for a revision we could reach an agreement with the Council .
118.4457	This year , the Haug report has taken advantage of this institutional declaration last year to discuss the need to revise the financial perspective .
21.3062	I believe , in actual fact , that both the Member States and the taxpayers are grateful that the charges are not still higher .
45.4137	We can not just keep on issuing endless directives and regulations , often without sufficient background information , scientific basis and generally to unbelievably short deadlines .
104.2032	We have overcome this to a considerable degree in foreign policy and I hope in the forthcoming budget debates that we shall take more decisions of substance and spend more time on the problems and less time haggling over national interests in this budget .
6.2194	This requirement does not apply to the flexibility reserve .
12.5266	After all , Russia too wants to be assessed by the same standards that we apply to ourselves .
4.2696	We are hoping that the cooperation will extend to external policy .
7.7139	Secondly , we must take great care to ensure diversity of production and supply in terms of energy .
30.8156	What is important , I think , is that it should continue to be the political responsibility of the administrative staff and should not turn into project management .
3.7869	Dozens of tons of waste plutonium have to be destroyed as a result of disarmament negotiations .
147.0107	Nor do I think it acceptable that the European Union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya .
34.7939	And yet Jawlinkski ' s portrayal of Europe ' s struggle with the phenomenon of Russia is very apt .
364.1875	Despite all its contradictions , Europeans clearly see Russia as part of Europe and have a huge interest in a stable , democratically-organised Russian Federation with good economic prospects which plays a confident part in and helps to shape international policy .
10.8952	Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Oostlander for his sterling contribution as rapporteur .
20.9963	We have already laid the foundations of a period of cooperation with Russia during which the political leadership has changed .
19.7728	The common strategy and Russia 's medium-term strategy for relations with the EU have created a new dynamism .
33.8613	The Commission has taken a leading role in the negotiation of an international agreement establishing the multilateral nuclear environment programme for Russia .
87.0778	Just one further word about a point that was raised by a couple of speakers in the debate - and that is the question of Georgia and visas .
54.8157	The Commission considers that once this new directive has come into force , it will make it possible to improve the current situation .
52.0602	The Lisbon Summit declared that the European Union was to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world .
24.1047	Question No 2 by -LRB- H-0871 / 00 -RRB- :
800.7557	Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we in Parliament have tried in vain to urge Mr Nielson , the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian matters , to visit Chechnya , not just for the sake of an official visit but to carry out a serious survey of the humanitarian situation .
8.3732	This Question Time is clearly not satisfactory .
11.1906	It also approved the summary of the report from the high-level group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector .
10.4222	This also refers to measures which might be undertaken in order to solve the specific problems of excise fraud .
71.1580	This is imperative and is something that was explicitly called for at the Feira European Council following the tragic events in Dover .
64.2155	The proposal provides for granting products from LDCs duty free access , amending the generalised tariff preference scheme currently implemented by the Community .
9.7624	You mentioned the Cotonou Agreement .
399.0009	Regarding the method of organisation and the criteria for the development of livestock farming , the Council would point out that , in the context of its decisions taken under the Agenda 2000 reform , emphasis has been placed on greater incentives for extensive production , particularly by means of bonuses .
179.2417	At any event there is now , I believe , a general increase in awareness throughout Europe which will enable whatever measures necessary to be taken in order to combat this disease .
175.4897	The bilateral political dialogue which the European Union is conducting with Algeria does indeed focus on the objectives you stressed in your question , i.e. restoring debate and a democratic political dynamic .
2632.8102	Consequently , on 20 November 2000 last , on the anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , the ministers of the Members States with responsibility for matters relating to children and a Commission representative met in Paris and adopted shared commitments which will contribute to enhancing European Union action in making preparations for this special session .
5025.2663	Does the Council intend to include in provisions regarding partnership arrangements stipulations regarding acceptance by Turkey of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague and compliance by Turkey with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights , in accordance with the unanimous wishes of the Council of Europe ?
24.8560	Question No 13 by -LRB- H-0897 / 00 -RRB- :
262.4184	Regarding the specific cases you mentioned , mutual recognition will not lead to validation of a judgement which flouts essential rights such as the right to legal representation of one ' s own choice or the right to the free assistance of an interpreter .
251.1687	According to these , with a view to setting up an operation , the Political and Security Committee -LRB- COPS -RRB- may submit a recommendation to the Council on the basis of advice from the Military Committee .
16.4954	Which taxes does the Council consider to have no bearing on the dynamic and competitive operation of the internal market ?
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. -RRB-
1100.3665	Mr President , the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement takes account of the new democratic developments in Croatia and highlights the European prospects for this country , which has managed in the course of the past year to achieve its aim of joining the international community of states .
6.2050	The new Croatian government has not only recognised but actually supports Europe 's Balkan policy .
14.5648	Indeed , that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure Croatia 's progress towards stabilisation .
5.7380	There they found their property and possessions in ruins .
147.7219	So I am delighted that we celebrate the end of the year by launching negotiations with Croatia for a stabilisation and association agreement .
25.6819	We have a team of officials in Croatia this week to look at programming for next year .
43.7333	With the start of these negotiations , Croatia has embarked on a new era in its relations with the European Union .
4.2876	The President is also still under fire over the Bulog and Brunei affair .
5.5997	That sort of violence only stirs up feelings of hatred .
48.7572	I have in mind sending UN observers to the crisis areas , where action is urgently needed , but also humanitarian relief action if necessary .
71.2150	These facts can only concern us , and therefore the initial optimism that was so clear in the Commission ' s communication should be reconsidered and tempered to some extent .
24.0261	We can support the democratisation process , as we have been doing ; what we can not do is take the place of the protagonists in this process .
36.2313	If these efforts should fall short of the mark , then we can not afford to rule out the possibility of the international community becoming more actively involved .
11.5322	It is of paramount importance that those guilty of human rights violations are not allowed to get away with it .
144.4959	We must learn from this year ' s experience , which has been a beneficial experience , and give a very powerful signal indicating the change that we want for Indonesia .
1173.1304	It was a recognition by the global community of the legality of the vote in Irian Jaya to become a permanent part of Indonesia and reaffirm United Nations Declaration 1514 of 1960 which prohibits any act aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a country .
0.2530	That is why we must link development aid to progress in human rights abuses .
7.1301	I listened with interest to the proposal made by the honourable Member towards the end of our discussion .
364.7474	I remember having the distinct feeling that this great country was poised somewhere on the high wire between riot and reform and that we would be very lucky if the democratic process produced a government such as the one that has been produced today .
5.6688	But above all , the legislation must be clearer , to prevent law-breakers from exploiting any loopholes .
19.4414	The same applies to the European Union .
13.0650	We know that the Commission discussed this question at its last meeting , without coming to a decision .
202.5411	In her speech at the meeting last month of the justice ministers of Germany ' s constituent States , Mrs Theato expressly said that the open frontiers facilitate criminal activities .
13.6627	Fortunately this idea found very little support at Nice last weekend .
373.8121	We must not forget that 85 % of the money is spent within the Member States and we must also not forget that Parliament ' s and the Commission 's role is to take a pan-European approach to these things .
533.5761	As Mrs Theato rightly points out in her report , OLAF occupies a crucial position in the Commission 's anti-fraud strategy , which is why , and I want to stress that very strongly , the Commission is extremely keen to see this authority built up rapidly .
12.3634	Reform of budgetary control procedures
5.1695	So , where are the reforms from these guilty Member States ?
133.0814	Controlling the Commission 's management and spending is the main justification for the existence of the European Parliament and the discharge procedure is the chief instrument by which this is done .
8.5249	This also happens in many reports .
7.9627	We must name countries , specific cases and institutions ; all these things would make it easier to understand .
0.2301	I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch .
5.5370	So let us understand that fraud is not a problem peculiar to the European Union .
805.1990	Regarding access to documents for the discharge report , which is indeed an important issue , let me point out that the Commission 's point of departure in its activities is the Interinstitutional Agreement reached in July this year , especially Annex 3 on access to confidential information .
45.5689	Let me point out that I will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the Member States ' representatives concerned with financial control .
388.1741	For that simple reason the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I am presenting today includes a whole raft of amendments containing concrete proposals on how these issues could be resolved .
30.1314	The only way to remedy these weaknesses is by deciding to opt for conciliation here by a majority of 314 votes .
0.2157	Unfortunately , we believe that some of the proposed amendments do not improve it .
0.4460	The third block contains those amendments that have been most controversial during the procedure .
16.7300	Some of the amendments seem to be a covert attempt to introduce some elements of a company statute through the back door .
134.4969	Mr President , the aim of this report - to establish common rules in Europe on takeover bids - relates only to a tiny minority of large corporations and their major shareholders , who dominate company ownership .
197.9229	Anyone who wants to avoid such consequences has the opportunity to vote in favour of Amendment No 19 , which makes it clear that it is the target company ' s head office which counts .
6.4567	But it should be pointed out that the situation has definitely changed since the first reading .
121.6988	That is something that everyone in the European Union is going to have to tackle and this takeover directive , in the final form that comes through has to address that issue .
29.8841	Much to its regret , the Commission is unable to approve the other amendments , and this is for a variety of reasons .
134.5142	Lastly , the Commission would point out that should this House approve the proposed amendments , it could prove very difficult for an agreement to be reached between the Council and Parliament .
328.5024	It needs to be harmonised because although it already applies in many EU states , it has not so far been recognised in the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Ireland or Austria .
178.1354	In addition , it is in the interests of both Switzerland and the USA to introduce a right of resale once we have adopted a harmonised right of resale in Europe .
119.6385	In addition , setting this type of precedent at a time when the European Union is set to double in size would be to give out the wrong signal to candidate states .
326.2812	In the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms , we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd .
15.6020	Without an international droit de suite , the fact is that the European art market will go offshore .
184.8960	I am afraid this leads me to the inevitable conclusion that we do not need this , and that without international agreement in place , it is one piece of internal market legislation that we can do without .
373.7990	The third and final issue is that of the threshold , which Amendment No 6 brings back down to EUR 1 000 or , in other words , to the Commission ' s original proposal .
7.7603	Madam President , on a point of order .
0.2167	It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate .
23.2637	We in the reporting committee agreed on a compromise , namely that the same weight ceiling should apply to cross-border mail and national mail .
162.5247	It is also guaranteed that cross-border mail will remain a service reserved for the postal services , and also , if VAT comes to be levied on postal services , that the tax should be levied at a reduced rate so as not to raise the price of stamps in the Community .
138.1778	Madam President , I welcome the fact that in committee we managed to achieve a balanced compromise on this issue and I hope that Parliament will adopt that position in substance tomorrow .
256.5217	Our group agrees with the Commissioner and with the Lisbon meeting of the European Council , though not that of Nice , that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services .
59.9724	We also need to make the point made by Mr Jarzembowski : so many studies have been conducted by this Commission , yet we have never seen them .
3.1671	Some people have said that we have liberalised telecoms and it was not a great problem .
72.3635	The same holds true for the Netherlands , and when I talk face to face with other people from postal companies , they do not express these concerns either .
73.4494	By putting operators in competition with each other in the most profitable areas , it would lead to the closure of a large number of post offices , job losses and insecure jobs and would result in social dumping .
70.4688	They will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the European Union .
9.3164	This would be in outright contrast with the goals the European institutions set themselves in Lisbon .
56.9382	At the same time , it is the country where the highest number of letters are delivered the day after they have been posted .
35.9986	Madam President , Council , Commissioner , I understand the desires expressed by some of my colleagues for an end-date and for moves towards greater liberalisation .
328.0665	I do believe that the compromise which is now on the table takes account of the aforementioned criteria , and I am delighted that our rejection of the general liberalisation of express services and cross-border services has now been set down in black and white .
113.9328	Quite the reverse in fact : the concept of universal services is ideally suited to solve problems encountered in rural areas and areas which are difficult to access , via agreements and , if need be , compensatory funding .
12.7060	Madam President , allow me to address Mr Simpson .
6.2796	The costs are not higher than in other countries .
160.4426	The radical reform which the Commission proposed at the beginning of this year is threatening to turn the clock back by two hundred years .
48.6629	In spite of this , the Commission chose to ignore the view expressed by the vast majority of Members of this House from various Member States and political groups .
7.2624	Madam President , the service we are considering faces fierce competition from the new information and communication technologies .
260.7958	Now , a self-styled ` soft ' version of the Commission ' s liberalising proposal is offered to us , particularly in connection with the price-weight threshold of 150 instead of 350 grammes .
855.8940	However , the compromise proposal which was submitted by the two large parties to the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism at the eleventh hour and brought about without the help of the Liberal Group , does not accommodate this view .
0.2040	We have , alongside this , an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation .
5.7209	All of them are backing Mr Simpson and opposing your party 's views on this matter .
53.4117	There are many possibilities apart from the one-stop shop where all government services are available to the local community , such as e-commerce and the Internet .
38.7250	Mrs Peijs , this is not a point of order and this is not the correct moment in the debate to make it .
7070.8565	The degree of market opening as now proposed by Parliament would reduce the 20 % of the Commission proposals to only 6 % from the start of the year 2005 , without any prospect of completion of the internal market in the postal sector and that , I am afraid , does not comply with the conclusions of the European Council , nor would it meet the needs and expectations of postal clients , both business users and individual households .
34.4218	I call upon all of you not to shy away from your responsibility as elected legislators to do what is required and to support a dynamic process of change .
301.9366	Most of the amendments adopted by Parliament 's Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism would , if accepted , lead to a situation where hardly anything would change .
11.3451	However , it will not surprise Members of this Parliament that the Commission can not accept the remaining proposed amendments .
54.5970	If Members of this Parliament are of the opinion that whatever Heads of State or Government say is of no concern to them , that is not an attitude that I share .
167.3540	At that time , the Commission proposed maintaining a non-discriminatory , fixed-quota system with a slight rating preference for the ACP countries and the transition to a ` tariff only ' system in 2006 .
48.6552	Codecision does not mean that the system is fair , but it means that it is the only method compatible with the rules of the WTO .
107.6168	These are differences , it is true , but now we are talking a similar language , which is radically different to the one we have used for years .
51.7436	The Dary report is a difficult and intricate piece of work which is worthy of praise , and has allowed us to unanimously approve a report on a truly complex issue .
4406.8481	Therefore , the proposals in the Dary report , approved unanimously in the Agriculture Committee , refer to the need to take account of the structural problems of these outermost regions , which furthermore have a new legal basis in Article 299 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the European Community Treaty , introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam , and which is currently awaiting the adoption of the relevant proposals by the Commission .
86.6521	But let us not turn our backs , as is suggested in Amendment No 11 , on the idea that we must eventually move to a ` tariff only ' system .
366.6021	Frankly , I believe that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did the best it could , or what was within its power to do , in order to reach an agreement with the Commission .
53.1835	That was the thinking behind the COM in the banana sector , and that is the thinking behind our rapporteur , Mr Dary ' s , counter-proposal .
48.1020	I hope that the Commission will respond positively to the amendments , not with the blanket negative view of the last debate , and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns .
212.6443	I trust that , with the passing of time , the system of distribution known as the ` regatta ' system , in other words , ` first come , first served ' , may be accepted by the banana-producing countries .
2.8942	We must not take that as evidence of unanimity in any way .
153.5002	It consists of four members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea , presided over by the Honourable Mr Jeymoon Chung .
8.2135	-LRB- The President declared the common position approved -RRB-
3167.2075	Recommendation for second reading -LRB- A5-0368 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on company law concerning takeover bids -LSB- 8129/1/2000 - C5-0327 / 2000 - 1995/0341 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB-
0.4066	In this context , the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention .
3600.4562	Report -LRB- A5-0364 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Baltas , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the Commission report on the feasibility of negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 311 - C5-0506 / 2000 - 2000/2244 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB-
101.8013	Mr President , I should like to inform you that , on 29 September this year , Portugal also ratified this Treaty unanimously .
45.5841	Of course , if we want to be consistent in our approach , we should put similar warnings on products which are equally harmful to consumers , such as animal fats .
162.7838	When I voted against the ban on the advertising of tobacco products in 1998 , my vote was misconstrued in letters to the editors of Luxembourg newspapers as a vote against the prevention of cancer .
10.2987	Over 95 % of the output of the Southampton plant is exported .
1.7395	It is preposterous that the tobacco lobby is seeking to destroy this legislation .
115.1009	It is important to avoid interruption and to proceed with the extension of the existing programmes in the field of public health that expire in the short term , given that their objectives are to complement national policies in protecting human health .
6.5938	In my opinion , they should be privatised .
19.9810	There must be more to this world than mere numbers and sterile computers : it must include artists - for as long as possible .
12.2560	In various Member States , it has transpired that resale right is superfluous and causes distortions on the internal market .
607.0877	I am concerned for their welfare not only because I have discovered that there is a Russian Pensioners ' Party whose symbol is a heart , a red heart , while the symbol of the European People 's Party , which I belong to , is a blue heart .
647.5736	We can , therefore , only condemn the fact that Fanjo Tudjman was not charged before his death , in the same way as Slobodan Milosevic , since the newly opened archives prove the extent to which the two men jointly planned the ethnic dismemberment of the region .
27.6052	I expelled them from the Pensioners ' Party myself , but I do consult them every now and again and ask their advice .
26.0563	We therefore welcome the Theato report and have voted for the creation of the office of a European Public Prosecutor .
21.9415	The government 's preference is to improve existing cooperation between Member States to tackle fraud and other serious crimes with a cross-border element .
1.5504	In my constituency I have industries that are being forced out of business .
131.7079	At the same time , it stresses how important it is for the Commission to listen to the European Parliament and consider the interests of all parties at every stage .
8.3946	A second subject that has played a part in this debate is that of the reports .
62.6309	A formal review of the compensatory-aid mechanism is therefore unnecessary , because the current regime permits full compensation for the income effects of price fluctuations .
101.5508	Mr President , I am pleased to have this opportunity to update Parliament on preparations for the EU/US Summit in Washington next Monday .
164.7093	We have made some progress in moving things in the direction I describe in recent summits and I hope we will be able to take this forward in Washington next week .
12.9430	This then will be the last summit under this administration , the last such summit with President Clinton .
10.2521	Another area relates to the aforementioned EU educational centres , which I believe have been highly successful .
157.0656	Research from the development agency OXFAM has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since Seattle with the developing country delegations , the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all .
15.6720	On every continent , a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people .
1449.5988	I think I am right in saying that EU/US trade amounts to about EUR 1billion a day and the total worth of the sanctions applied by the United States against European goods represents about six hours ' worth of trade .
1.5711	Mr President , I shall just take a moment , with your permission .
344.1711	The proposal which the Commission has referred to Parliament has , in my opinion , a priority objective : to remedy the discriminatory situation currently suffered by European e-commerce companies in comparison to companies from third countries .
63.1865	Consequently , services provided by European companies to non-European companies would always be exempt from the tax , which would revive our international competitiveness .
261.4416	Thirdly , and this I do agree with , the need - within the international framework of the ICAO - to make all the progress necessary to establish a tax which is world-wide , and therefore not discriminatory , on Community transport .
112.2585	They disadvantage people inside the EU because they currently pay VAT for the supply of these services whereas those outside the European Union do not .
3.8862	It may not be enough to rely on the good will of enterprises outside our reach .
119.4208	Add to this the unruly increase in the number of flights , including short-haul flights , and the question arises as to where all of this will end . In business and leisure travel alike , people must be able to choose on the basis of honest competitive conditions .
18.5647	The question arising here is whether VAT is levied when such items are the subject of a service which is provided electronically .
1.7493	We are already familiar with the problems in the domains of VAT and energy taxes .
6.7222	It is both an excellent and necessary ambition .
67.3751	Mr President , I believe that the successive interventions of our fellow MEPs in the Liberal Group show the complexity of the problem .
10.3461	Therefore , point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome .
7.0149	We would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods .
99.1896	The sixth VAT directive must be simplified ; if any limit is to be imposed at all on VAT rates , it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum .
10.3095	The right to levy taxes and other charges is one of the foundations of any organised society .
146.5096	American local sales tax may vary between zero and ten points , although the difference between neighbouring states is generally no more than five points .
44.5654	Furthermore , it is not true that a moratorium on the taxation of electronic services has been introduced in the United States .
56.3732	The main reason for this is the fact that different regions have different rules for night flying , a situation which affects cargo transport in particular .
51.5567	I think that the real problem is that EU retail industries will continue to suffer the disadvantages that they are currently suffering .
21.3244	Mr President , I wish to address my concerns this afternoon to the proposed taxation on aircraft fuel .
58.9451	There are those , like Mr Titford , who vigorously defend their own national interest , preferring tax competition to European coordination .
145.6924	If this can provide the basis for a compromise , it will probably be a good compromise as long as it is not used to reintroduce distortion of competition due to the different VAT rates applicable in our various Member States .
92.0463	By focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the EU , we risk harming our industry without achieving much-needed progress in lowering emissions .
3.6452	I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe .
218.0713	I would especially like to thank the rapporteur , Mr GarcÃa - Margallo y Marfil , for his contribution and for the positive ideas which were put forward in his report .
67.2339	As usual , we need to ensure that the solution we opt for does not give cause for concern outside the Community with regard to discrimination against suppliers who are not based in the Community .
525.4391	However , it should also be pointed out that the current climate , where the conditions are not favourable for achieving further harmonisation of VAT rates in the short term , makes meaningful progress in the near future very unlikely .
347.3867	A resolution issued by the general meeting of the ICAO which paves the way for an internal solution to the issue of tax on aircraft fuel or the use of other instruments with equivalent effects would be a crucial first step in the right direction .
1178.2267	It is obvious that one State of the Union on its own can not have any real influence on maritime transport across the world and , on the other hand , the International Maritime Organisation is too slow and lacks effective means to adequately monitor the rules which it lays down .
4061.8013	Thus the Commission ' s priority is to try to resolve these two problems , and the solution we propose is to supplement the existing funds through the creation of a European fund financed by the oil companies , which would offer the victims quick compensation of up to EUR 1 000 million , instead of the EUR 200 million - USD 180 million - currently granted by the international authorities .
38.0247	If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate , which would be unfortunate , we shall then try to sort out this issue .
57.5401	Even the countries which have a lesser degree of safety with regard to their ships have some ships which are safe ; therefore , in accordance with international laws , we can not exclude them a priori .
101.4787	Regarding the Erika II package , I shall confine myself to one question in the form of an observation , although there are so many to be made !
826.0243	Provided that the implementation aspects of the charge in question do not introduce indirect discrimination either and they respect all other relevant specific rules governing the introduction of user charges in the European Union , such a charge seems at this stage to be in line with current Community law , that is Directive 1999/62/EC .
799.0421	I have set out in the Commission 's response the principles and the criteria and assured Parliament that the Commission will analyse and follow closely the development of the UK scheme , including its implementation in practice , and of course the absence of any discrimination be it direct or indirect will be a crucial reference point in such an assessment .
727.8317	Mr President , given the evolution of the situation within the European Community , the Commission is writing to third countries drawing their attention to the measures taken in relation to BSE within the European Union and alerting them to the need to consider similar measures .
1820.0558	Subject : EU funding for the Palestinian education system It appears that a large number of school books issued by the Palestinian Authority contain anti-Semitic statements and incitement to hatred of Jews that would result in prosecution for ` incitement to racial hatred ' , in any EU Member State .
88.6470	Those are a few passages from the Palestinian schoolbooks used to teach children in the territories , an education service , moreover , which we ourselves are funding to a large extent .
8.0994	That starts with the young people .
96.6827	Mr Patten , sitting alongside him , must have been squirming when he heard that answer , because in the previous question we heard a great lecture on respect for human rights .
20.0477	The report concludes , inter alia , that the aid received by our industry has not solved the Korean issue .
71.2629	On a multilateral level , the Commission will pursue its efforts to establish a level international playing field for the shipbuilding industry within the OECD .
216.3534	The Commission report has established that , as operating aid has not been helpful in solving the problems created by unfair Korean competition , we decided not to prolong those operating aids .
4.8244	There are therefore unlikely to be harmful effects on employment and competition in the coke-using industry .
6.0485	I shall answer both questions at the same time .
251.0580	We are therefore prepared to monitor the effects of this initiative and its results very carefully and to examine , if need be together with the ACP States , the measures which might be required in order to preserve their competitive position in the Community ' s markets .
5.8424	The initiative is not therefore of a kind which will destabilise the highly protected Community sugar market .
666.3593	As my colleague Bill Newton-Dunn said , we have a number of colleagues in the UK who are indulging in fairly standard if facile anti-European scaremongering on this proposal and they have got a large number of sugarbeet farmers extremely worried .
210.2080	Programmes like Stop and Daphne have been earmarked by the Commission to allow child sex tourism to be fought as a form of sexual exploitation of children and violence against children in the candidate countries too .
16.6374	The second area is technology .
31.9428	I should like to point out that Munich is situated in the heart of Europe and is also very accessible .
18.9179	If Mr MacCormick means a functional proliferation of courts of justice , I can see his point of view .
437.5935	Those contacts have been successful to the extent that , over the past year , another three Member States have submitted their lists with courts of first and second instance for the Community trade mark .
1355.4844	Subject : Thessaloniki underground rail system After more than eight years , the Thessaloniki underground rail system - an infrastructure project designed to promote the sustainable economic development of the city - still unfortunately exists only on paper in the 2nd CSF , the local newspapers and the Ministry for the Environment , Regional Planning and Public Works .
1292.5034	What I want from you is a specific date by which you will reply to me , together with your interpretation of the European Investment Bank 's action and whether its present refusal to fund the project is due to the fact that the project is currently bogged down at the Commission - this too is an accusation which you have not investigated .
2.4344	If this is the case , then I thank you for that .
3.5893	The directives apply to professions which do not fall within one particular directive .
9.3581	obtaining a EU subsidy to support the unprofitable regional traffic network ,
426.1325	What is clear is that future action will include an examination of infrastructure across the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia and therefore I am confident that due consideration will be taken of the situation faced by the ferry services .
179.7543	Owing to the fast-changing nature of this sector , the EU needs to take immediate and concrete measures since the new communication technologies are already generating demand for content , products and services as well as having considerable social impact .
64.0782	My reasoning is that I believe there is a greater potential for public/private partnerships as there is a huge commercial value to be exploited on the market in the interest both of companies and citizens .
16.1649	In implementing the programme , I therefore want us to have a requirement for a definition of what may constitute digital content .
20.6768	Although linguistic differences might mean extra costs , multilingual content is an important precondition of democracy in the EU .
0.2404	We should actively seek such cooperation and develop joint strategies with the applicant countries .
33.6912	The stumbling blocks of modern technology and the possible need to communicate in a foreign language can now be more easily overcome .
449.9533	I also want to say how important it is for citizens of the European Union to be able to develop professionally , socially and culturally and how important it is to avoid , in this area , the creation of that digital divide to which we refer so often in our debates .
8.3391	The budget proposed by the Commission is EUR 150 m over five years .
8.1153	Thank you very much for your attention .
70.2848	If a group would like to vote against , it has of course every right to do so , but we must also give others the opportunity to vote in favour and let the democratic process run its course .
7.6825	The Commission now estimates that one in every three Europeans complains about noise .
13.7377	The Environmental Committee has criticised the European Commission ' s hesitation to propose EU noise standards .
30.6327	As far as legislation is concerned , I would , however , like to prioritise and , initially , to opt for regulation of noise around airports .
28.1941	The harmonisation of noise-measurement procedures and the production of action plans by the Member States are good things but are not enough to satisfy us .
69.1797	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are many citizens of the European Union for whom quality of life is just a mirage .
6.0204	It is our duty as MEPs and as a European institution to do something about this .
150.8611	But this mechanism is of no use , since , unfortunately , people do not sleep siestas all year in Spain and it is not even slept in the whole of Spain .
3.3220	We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House .
9.6994	We must know the precise levels at which exposure starts to harm people in the long and short term .
0.1812	That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it .
7.2328	A particular problem is the noise around airports .
99.0285	To conclude I would like to thank European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been contributed .
307.8442	According to all the scientific literature and the Scientific Committee for Human Food , this additive is innocuous , but it has a laxative effect which is considered to be negligible in the small quantity ingested .
16.3202	We would not ask for peeled and cut carrots to be plunged into alginate , and support the rapporteur in his amendment .
25.1585	In anticipation of the Council 's discussion of the matter , the Commission has chosen to withdraw permission for the use of ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose .
18.9430	Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that approval of the joint draft text will guarantee us a win tomorrow .
0.5557	Furthermore , the results of the inspections will be imparted to the European Parliament .
6.8423	The PPE-DE Group supports the compromise that has been achieved .
61.7423	But , anyway , the idea of sustainable urban development has grown into something significant in just the last few years .
30.1461	There are many rural parts of the European Union that need to be developed and sustained in a positive manner .
62.9881	One major challenge in creating an urban policy is to find the means of pursuing sustainable urban development objectives within the administrative structure of the city .
4.7261	It is often in the municipalities and towns that they are most aware of their own problems .
35.8194	Accordingly , we are strongly in favour of the establishment of a platform of dialogue with the key stakeholders to help determine the priority themes to be supported .
677.3738	So , to conclude , the Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 2 , 5 to 8 , 10 to 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 to 20 , 22 to 24 , 28 , 30 , 32 to 35 and 37 .
146.0987	In order to explain the result I should like our Parliament to arrive at , I should like this evening quickly to underline two key aspects of this debate .
57.2996	The European Union ' s ambition is to guarantee its citizens a high level of protection where their health and the environment are concerned .
14.5019	After all , let us remind ourselves that BSE was brought to public attention through a minority report .
9.9547	We must avoid unknown risks .
2519.2736	It is a very positive sign that the Council text says that it considers that the WTO rules basically allow for account to be taken of the precautionary principle , and further that it calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure that , and I quote , `` the precautionary principle is fully recognised in all trade fora to pursue that aim and ensure that it is taken into account at the same time , particularly at the World Trade Organisation '' .
1425.3370	Mr President , as the rapporteur points out very effectively , the cautionary or precautionary principle - even though the rapporteur differentiates between the two - is laid down in several international agreements , ranging from Rio 1992 , to the protection of the North Sea and , more recently , in the Montreal Biosecurity Protocol .
54.1092	Mrs Patrie ' s opinion that the EU must clarify its stance on the precautionary principle , has my unqualified support .
420.2059	By establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied , it clarifies its use at a European level , making it more credible , and it mandates the European negotiators in the next round of the World Trade Organisation to inscribe the precautionary principle as basic and universal .
20.9840	It is just a shame that it is not the scientific community but the internal market that controls what is released onto the market .
17.9923	I also think that far too much emphasis is placed on the assessment of a matter by experts , toxicologists and economists .
10.1548	We now examine how this resolution should be followed up .
3.4242	To conclude , I would like to thank Parliament for its support in addressing this issue .
12.3766	That is also why Parliament sides with your struggle .
96.8994	Our organisation includes teachers and workers , public employees and private individuals , religious and lay people , trade unionists , businesspeople , militant pacifists , artists , people working in the media , very well-known individuals and many who are completely unknown .
399.4418	There is daily extortion of traders and professional people , there are countless forms of harassment and threats against people considered to be ` espaÃ ± olistas ' , that is to say , those who dare to publicly express their support for the rule of law that has come into force by constitutional means .
9.7541	We shall now proceed to the signing of the budget .
1246.4793	I. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation -LRB- EEC -RRB- No 218/92 on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation -LRB- VAT -RRB- -LRB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 349 - C5-0298 / 2000 - 2000/0147 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RRB- , and
79.0948	Instead of what is suggested by the words `` of producers and artists , especially from the non profit-making sector '' , my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers .
1898.7819	Report -LRB- A5-0352 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Patrie , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the Commission communication on the precautionary principle -LRB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 1 - C5Â0143 / 2000 - 2000/2086 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RRB-
369.1150	At the second reading of the budget , Parliament has just approved the full reinstatement to the Cohesion Fund budget line of EUR 360 million , which it had placed in reserve on the first reading .
239.3213	The gravity of the situation has led our group to table a number of amendments highlighting the importance of earmarking the necessary funds for standardising screening tests and for compensation for them , as well as for massive aid to the cattle industry , which has been severely affected .
377.2634	Here in Parliament we take every suitable opportunity , as well as some unsuitable opportunities , to adopt resolutions about the reunification of families . Yet we want to tear the families of our own officials apart , especially those in the D , C and B grades , who can not afford expensive removals and all the other financial burdens such moves entail , on the basis of the spurious argument that we have to cut costs in this particular way .
4.8097	However , the need for a long-term solution for future budget years remains .
31.1719	Staes report -LRB- A5-0372 / 2000 -RRB-
31.9552	Moreover , we must break the tendency to import American incongruities into Europe in this area as in other areas .
151.8634	We also consider it unjustifiable that countries in the EU compete in Sweden ' s postal market , for example , when they are not prepared to allow competition in their own markets .
27.9504	We are not asking Sweden to change its system , but we certainly do not want it to impose its system on us .
59.3661	The compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect , which means that I can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading .
5.6850	I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
3.0257	However , we are happy to see inter-state solutions in this area .
1387.3853	We must have the courage to continue to protect those areas of the European Union - and I refer in particular to the most remote areas such as the Canary Islands and other areas - which earn their livelihood from banana production and which need and have the right to be protected by the Union as a whole , including the States who do not produce bananas .
802.6104	Exactly eight months ago , this House sent a very clear message to the Commission : the adoption of a wholly tariff-based system after a transitional period of six years would inevitably condemn banana producers within the Community and those from the ACP to bankruptcy and misery .
0.2371	We must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests .
37.7889	This proposal for a Council decision is in line with the action intended to improve the networks of knowledge in Europe .
64.1221	We have already heard vivid examples in this Parliament of separatist Members who would rather speak in English than in the official language of their Member State .
95.9864	It should , however , be emphasised that the strong endorsement of EU enlargement , highlighted by Amendment 1 , which was adopted , I wholeheartedly subscribe to .
38.6780	The Heads of State and Government locked themselves into short-term haggling , without any great vision of Europe ' s future .
62.8109	Germany will therefore find it easier than the others to reach the blocking threshold , by adding a few smaller countries to its sphere of influence .
1.6376	On this point , too , we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved .
9.5153	That is natural .
508.3759	The Nice Summit has sadly become known as a further step in the militarisation of the European Union and as a major threat to the sovereignty of the small - and medium-sized countries like Portugal , which , in general , are losing power and the ability to influence decisions .
4.3651	This was domestic politicking for the sake of a forthcoming election .
573.8534	We can not , however , ignore the fact that the solutions found for the complex decision-making system in the Council and the corresponding vote weighting increase the gap between the more and the less highly populated states , which is something we regard as less positive because of our concept of a Europe of sovereign nations .
11.9126	We therefore oppose the principal orientation of the Treaty of Nice and will vote against it .
9.5156	Flying used to be expensive .
7.4854	` Oh no , God forbid !
553.2634	For that reason , we should endorse the call for the responsible authorities at national , regional and local levels to ensure , by their own efforts and with the aid of all available EU support mechanisms , that the same terms and conditions are created throughout the EU for the acquisition of modern information technology by educational establishments .
10.1964	We must avoid being too prescriptive and thus putting up artificial barriers which would prevent us reaching our goals .
432.7987	There is a passage in Mr Markov ' s draft , Commissioner , which I would like you to take into account and which says , and with this I shall end : `` suggests likewise , given the scant budgetary allocation set aside for innovatory measures , that the Commission encourage the incorporation of this type of project in the regional operational programmes '' .
9.2636	We should spell that out very clearly .
50.9534	Finally , may I too congratulate Mr Markov and wish everyone a Merry Christmas and an Innovative New Year .
562.6611	We fought hard to keep the innovative measures within the new round of structural fund programmes and I am really pleased that we are here today , both confirming this and the EUR 3 million that is going to be available through agreeing the new guidelines .
9.2235	Furthermore , I would like to draw attention to another aspect of the new policy proposed by the Commission .
8.7452	So these are the priorities .
76.2886	However , I understand that this concern needs to be coordinated with other instruments , especially - as you suggested earlier Mr Markov - with the European Social Fund .
122.0984	I am also positive that , even with these necessarily limited sums , we may still exercise a significant leverage effect and impact on all the Structural Funds programmes .
520.2122	We in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy welcomed the fact that the European Commission has taken steps to have the issue resolved by means of a dispute-settlement procedure before the World Trade Organisation .
13.8704	The conclusions seem quite clear that the principal culprit is predatory pricing from the Korean shipbuilding industry .
49.7851	What we are calling for , what I am calling for today is the full and - more importantly - the immediate application of the Council 's conclusions .
254.3062	And I do not believe that we are exaggerating because the different workers ' groups have been claiming that over recent years thousands and thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of the restructuring of the shipbuilding industry .
251.5315	I would like to thank Mr Langen for his work and hope that we do not have a re-run of the same debate at the end of next year .
133.6684	But as soon as the capitalist groups whose interests they defend are in trouble on the markets , they call for governments or the European institutions to intervene , subsidise and protect the sector under threat .
15.8413	There is a crisis in the fishing industry , and we Spaniards and Galicians know that only too well .
47.9167	In reality , there are limited instruments available to the Commission and Member States in order to defend the EU shipbuilding industry .
139.2687	Industry should seriously reflect about how these instruments can be used to adapt their activities in a way which will ensure the future of the sector on a lasting basis .
1159.4809	I do not think there is any need to add anything to what Mr Galeote has just said other than to assure him of our support and solidarity and I agree that , in future , we need to look at ways in which we can perhaps assist our colleagues in Spain .
3.9360	But the director of the hospital did not authorise the admission .
9.1725	Let us not wait any longer .
10.4415	I can assure you that it was not due to a lack of will on the part of my Group .
191.4991	After visits to the submarine by Spanish nuclear safety experts , we have heard that there is no danger , but we have had later statements indicating that they were not allowed to see , observe or inspect the actual site of the fault .
121.6836	When I became a Commissioner I swore an oath to be completely independent in the performance of my duties in the general interest of the Communities , to neither seek nor take instructions from any government or from any other body in the performance of my duties .
1443.4664	The intervention plan is `` drawn up by the interested parties , which include the British Ministry of Defence , the Gibraltar Government and the emergency services and is issued by the Chief Officer , Gibraltar City Fire Brigade , and the Commander of British Forces , on behalf of the Gibraltar Local Liaison Committee .
1734.6000	One might well ask whether the government of the United Kingdom has exercised its responsibility in that regard to keep its defence equipment properly maintained , and indeed whether people in the UK are aware that , because of this incident , and the withdrawal of other nuclear submarines , our shores are currently being defended - rumour has it - by a U-boat from Germany .
19.5724	I felt , listening to the Commissioner 's excellent report , growing confidence that the matter is being handled in the proper way .
216.6846	But I must still point out that , however worrying , this affair also has its amusing side and , if nothing else , illustrates the current state of Europe , the Europe of Nice .
3027.9067	On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card-carrying member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations .
2486.9414	I am not being alarmist , I am not against nuclear energy , I would never defend , as I believe nobody in Spain would , the idea of a submarine being moved at any cost if that meant an increased risk , but it is not in the spirit of European democracies , nor of the European Union Treaty , for decisions to be taken which jeopardise human safety and cause a population to be put at risk for the sake of greater technical , budgetary and diplomatic comfort .
52.4695	Repairing a submarine in situ remains by far the safest option available : towing it would not only be dangerous but would , in any event , require considerable repairs to be done beforehand .
186.1222	The important thing at the moment is to ensure that we are provided with good , transparent information , with a sufficient scientific basis , on the scope and consequences of the repairs , and that there be a serious study of the possibilities and risks involved in a possible removal of the submarine , if that becomes necessary .
1.4797	B5-0921 / 2000 by Muscardini and Collins , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
12.9599	At the same time , fewer and fewer countries are abiding by the agreements of the Geneva Convention .
1.2053	The UNHCR is currently helping 5 million displaced persons and some 11.5 million refugees .
277.8830	The Commission and the UNHCR therefore demonstrated , on 6 July , the strengthening of their partnership on asylum and refugees through an exchange of letters between Commissioner Vitorino and Mrs Ogata .
765.7946	That is why I am extremely keen to see appropriate changes made in our new financial regulation to ensure that we can support programming so that UN bodies and other similar organisations can be sure some time in advance of a flow of funds to support work we are doing in common and to which we both attach priority .
17.4238	B5-0920 / 2000 by Muscardini , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
1811.4989	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , on 25 December - Christmas Day - of last year , three prominent Albanian Kosovars started a three-week hunger strike in Brussels to bring to the attention of the international community the fate of these prisoners and especially of the many thousands of missing persons .
32.6416	For all our delight at the changes in Belgrade , we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims .
8.7381	What we need now are concrete steps to reach lasting peace .
196.0104	Despite this , many Kosovar Albanians remain in prison in Serbia and there remain many missing Kosovar Albanians and Serbs whom the ICRC is still attempting to trace .
11.6146	B5-0930 / 2000 by Di Pietro , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
14.0303	B5-0936 / 2000 by Gemelli , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
1598.7634	The only thing we can do here is to support the Chilean Government at this time and , taking advantage of the presence of Commissioner Patten , to ask him , as the previous speaker , Mr Salafranca , did , for a new agreement to be sought with Chile which will help continue to strengthen democracy in that country .
12.9446	We are happy that the situation has now changed .
21.9592	Turkey
96.4618	But it is also true that the hunger strike is taking place at a time when reforms are under way in the Turkish regime , and specifically in the area of prison policy .
4316.2481	May I also take this occasion to say that it is , of course , not only a matter of there being too many political prisoners - the fact that a country applying for membership of the European Union has any political prisoners at all merits outright condemnation - but that we are also aware of the way in which the existing prisons and the conditions that prevail within them have led to various criminal activities emanating from Turkish prisons .
326.0650	This is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression , association or assembly ; now , freedom of movement , freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one 's choice are difficult to exercise in Tunisia .
486.5518	The spokesman of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties , Professor Moncef Marzouki , is due to appear in court this week , on 16 December , and risks ten years in prison .
5.5445	We in liberal camps are very concerned at this development .
18.7336	However , this requires Tunisia to respect agreements entered into , including those which encompass clauses on human rights .
278.6964	Any meeting , any gathering , such as the national conference organised by the Tunisian National Council for Liberties on 10 December , is effectively banned due to police violence .
238.6082	The Commission is , and always has been , fully committed to respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and that is why the Commission has lent substantial and tangible support to the process of transition to democracy in Chile .
213.6509	Although I would not want to downplay it , the situation , despite being serious , does not appear to be out of control and there is some concern that outside interference could harm the chances of the two sides reaching some form of negotiated settlement .
147.6520	Whatever the economic progress made , whatever the social progress in Tunisia , I know that Parliament will return to its concerns on these subjects as long as it has reason to express them .
5.4548	We were delighted , Commissioner , at the departure of General Guei .
47.4308	The traumatic events that have occurred there are a clear demonstration of the process of degradation that the whole of the African continent is experiencing .
29.5401	That is exactly what has happened also in the CÃ ´ te d'Ivoire , and in an even grosser way , as I understand it .
12.1696	It is to France 's credit that it is supporting its partners and allies in this healthy development .
20.2390	The vote will be taken in a few minutes .
64.6705	In that case , ladies and gentlemen , it is confirmed that the draft resolutions mentioned by Mr Wurtz have been withdrawn , and therefore this vote lapses .
226.4763	I deeply regret that the French Government has not appealed to the Court of Justice against the European Parliament decision , but I have no doubt that this decision will be overturned sooner or later .
968.8520	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0319 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Sbarbati , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission communication ` Towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity ' .
0.2322	This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified , independent , self-sufficient lifestyle .
5.2262	The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard .
271.4657	Over the past decade in Central and Eastern Europe , we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate .
126.2204	In the next few decades , an ageing and greying population will emerge , caused by a falling birth rate and an increase in life expectancy .
6.2941	Here , too , individualism has taken its toll .
2118.7316	And the worker , who has given everything to society , has to sell his house to pay for healthcare , to use up all his money and to see his family reduced to scrimping and saving , at the very moment when one would expect the State and other people to be supportive , during the last years of one 's life , when everything looks black and the only ray of light is the help of one 's neighbour .
40.3969	The communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death .
2.7991	Almost all of the speakers have mentioned the `` ageing workforce '' .
149.8491	Consequently , I can only be delighted , today , at the issue of this communication and this report aimed at building a Europe for all ages and promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity .
85.1660	Mrs Flemming has rightly pointed out that it is positive that people are able to live for longer and at the same time stay healthy .
889.1461	As part of efforts to combat discrimination on the basis of Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty , there is a campaign for measures to be introduced to ensure that older people are no longer excluded from the workplace , which is actually saying that the obligatory age limit and also compulsory early retirement are discriminatory .
22.8768	Mr President , my father , Robert Purvis , is 90 and not too well just now .
172.9349	Concerns about closing the age gap in Europe 's performance balance sheet have been reflected very strongly in the employment process , from the guidelines to the recommendations to the NLP and peer review procedures .
93.6141	In fact it is a precondition for our ability to find sufficient resources for those in need of care , so that the wealthy amongst us are willing and able to pay higher contributions and become more independent in old age .
930.6712	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0385 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Dary , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market .
45.8190	A coherent product promotion policy is one of the tools making it possible to put European farm models into practice effectively .
7.9427	We need to emphasise the European aspects to the general public .
3.7441	I believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products .
125.6559	And while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers , we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves , who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them .
95.7604	A simple truth , if people are now saying that we could not guarantee calf feed because there was no milk replacer feed , is that calves drink milk .
7.4276	It is also important to point out that there are serious faults in this aspect of agricultural policy .
5.3254	I agree that we should spend money on this subject .
0.2302	The existing schemes , which lacked uniformity , will thus be harmonised and simplified .
23.5348	Consequently , thanks to your help and your opinion , the Community will soon be in a position to implement an important new promotional tool .
698.0296	But this does not in any way change what I said clearly just now , that we also need to pay attention to the small details , that we must not forget the superior culture of a European agricultural policy which is geared towards social and ecological concerns , and that we should always check measures to ensure that they are also having the desired effect .
4.2189	I really must protest about that , as it was only 15 million .
5.2187	We must continue to refer to the Internal Market principles in our policy , including public health .
16.6898	Our declaration of rights is the first of this millennium .
166.5287	Let us , as a Europe of 15 Member States , organise ourselves in order to be able to welcome those countries who are knocking at the door into the fold under respectable conditions .
119.1583	Provision for social , cultural and charitable causes must be included in Article 87 so that the future of these important institutions can also be permanently safeguarded .
29.4981	Some people think that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles .
0.5066	I too would like to welcome Mr Prodi ' s forceful and meaningful intervention .
2017.0420	You will be aware that this was a deliberate decision taken in Amsterdam to clearly distinguish the two roles , with the High Representative , as opposed to the Commission , not speaking from a completely independent viewpoint , but under a remit to coordinate the common foreign and security policies that lie within the competence of the Member States , and there we should leave perhaps ample scope for an intergovernmental approach .
8.2708	He wanted the Presidency to outline the way forward at Nice .
24.9181	One could indeed wish for more and for improvement , but I honestly believe that we have made a good start .
569.5527	I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will associate itself with this project and decide to launch it as a practical project rather than an accomplished fact once , of course , the reforms of which we are currently in need have been adopted .
216.5850	However , I also specified clearly that , as things stand at the moment , we can achieve extremely important objectives through the Community method as it is today , for example , to improve our action in the Balkans .
242.5215	Only if we bind Russia to the West and to the European Union will we also be able to bring an influence to bear on its policies and remain in contact and in discussion with Russia .
393.3445	Motion for a resolution -LRB- B5-0767 / 00 -RRB- by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights
176.7389	He is currently continuing this genocide and moreover he is also trying to completely eliminate the freedom of the media and the rule of law in Russia , which , as it is , barely exist .
1053.1546	In order to do something to meet the expectations of this pensioner , who is called Giuseppe Italia , lives in Cremona and would love to be able to sail on the Po , I voted for the Piecyk report , which concerns the expansion and development of sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals .
65.3796	The result of the voting in this House makes the objective of the directive - which was recognised and supported by all the speakers and the Commission - unattainable .
62.3290	Mr President , I voted for the Skinner report , as I explained during the debate before the vote , because I feel that risk capital is important .
121.2454	My colleague Mrs Armonie Bordes cuttingly pointed out yesterday that only a minority benefit from deploying community capital and pension premiums for entrepreneurial risks .
78.9777	The Charter will , consequently , be used more to enshrine the current practices , including the reactionary practices , of the national States than to represent genuine progress .
85.7596	Mr President , at last we have a Charter of the rights of the European citizen with an entire article - Article 25 - dedicated to the elderly .
1696.5749	This text may initially seem benign , since it basically reiterates existing rights , but if it were to be incorporated into the treaty and to be made binding , as the European Parliament is urging , it would automatically tend to standardise national legal systems in Europe ; it would give the Court of Justice disproportionate power ; it would promote increased centralisation around the European institutions ; it would restrict every nation ' s margin for autonomous decision making .
12.6790	Â · The Charter should not be overloaded with detailed rules ; these should remain the preserve of subordinate law .
200.8915	I shall be voting for an alternative charter by participating in the demonstrations in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October and in Nice on 7 December 2000 .
19.1332	Progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries
600.6247	In my opinion , even today there are a number of Member States which have still not understood that this link exists , and that the slow progress in the Intergovernmental Conference might make it very difficult for us to bring about enlargement in the necessary time frame .
1177.7378	We will only be able to achieve all the objectives which I have mentioned so far if politicians and the elite both in the applicant countries and in the European Union - and in this limited context I agree with you , Commissioner - finally advertise the fact that the enlargement of the European Union is actually of benefit to Europe itself too .
8.9661	That is the wording adopted .
71.9470	Let me now mention the second guideline along which the Presidency hopes the enlargement process will develop in these six months .
152.6541	What I therefore propose is to work towards this , bearing in mind that , with a view to 2003 , we shall have to examine which candidates are ready to join us at that time .
304.9198	I should like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , Mr Brok , for his clear , comprehensive report .
31.7353	There is no single case in the negotiations in which it is a question of `` if '' ; it is only a question of `` how '' and `` when '' .
229.8493	But they have also done so because the prospect of membership of the European Union gives them hope of solidarity with the people of Europe and because they are being offered a firm political and economic foothold .
176.2322	A number of countries have made such good progress with the second economic criterion of their ability to compete in the single market that they are fast reaching the point at which they are ready for accession .
27.6479	We are therefore looking to coordinate as closely as possible with the programmes of national governments , Parliament and other institutions .
227.2712	Every year - and this is shortly to happen again , on 8 November - each candidate country awaits with bated breath the judgement of the Commission with regard to the progress made .
15.8890	We were right in opting for the principle of differentiation , whereby each candidate country is assessed on its own merits .
1428.6278	This debate is a further opportunity for my group to reaffirm its view that the accession of the central and eastern European countries , but also of Cyprus and Malta , is the best way of safeguarding the future for all of us in Europe both in the East and in the West .
5.5396	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention .
23.3235	People joke that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall enlargement is always just five years away .
140.8364	The next natural opportunity would be the European parliamentary elections that follow in 2009 , but we would like to push for as many countries as possible joining in 2004 .
3.4023	Furthermore , there are six basic aspects which worry us because of the method employed .
733.8718	In actual fact , the thing we are rushing into is the very model of the construction of Europe , by which I mean to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or special characteristics of the individual sectors , which once again has turned into a trap .
136.3600	The way in which this almost universal feeling found expression in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 80s still merits our gratitude to this day .
1.6062	To make matters clear , however , there can be no accession on the cheap .
252.8090	This contains a powerful idea , which is also a fine idea , namely that we shall not carry out enlargement in the face of opinion and that , effectively , the best way to carry out enlargement with the assent of opinion is by involving it in elections , since elections are the expression of democracy and the citizens ' means of gaining access to the political system .
76.6756	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should just like to say a few words about the sine qua non for the scenario which many here have called for .
2.9779	I would be most surprised if they did not exert any pressure .
22.6089	But , as I have already indicated , all the countries are approaching the point at which they will be ready for accession relatively quickly .
64.8463	In other words liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products has already been agreed and the Poles are not worried that Polish agriculture will collapse as a result .
67.9866	There have been strains but , on the whole , peace and trade have established a closer association between people , now further consolidated by means of the currency union .
4.7048	It must be the results of the negotiations which count .
42.8571	The only amendment which has already been tabled is covered in my report , but I am pleased that the Greens wish to emphasise the importance of treating citizens equally .
26.3664	This does not just mean a law for the civil service ; it also means giving young civil servants opportunities and paying them a decent wage .
17.4718	That applies to both Latvia and the European Union .
18.2630	There are plans to peg the litas to the euro in the second half of 2001 .
1463.8397	Mr President , Commissioner , Poland , the country for which I am rapporteur , is the largest and most important of the countries which are preparing to enter the European Union , but it is also , as we know , the most problematic , so much so that there have been rumours that it might be excluded from the first group , the group of countries which are to join the Union first .
111.4216	There are too many promises which we have made to Poland , the countries of Eastern Europe , the former Communist countries , and failed to keep .
89.3409	There is still one point which crops up constantly when talk turns to the Czech Republic and that is the problem of the Roma .
85.7184	Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic .
57.6371	On a final note , I would like to take the liberty of making one comment on Slovakia ' s home affairs policy .
484.1113	Thirdly , with regard to agriculture , which has a lower level of productivity than in the European Union , we need to ensure that the agricultural market is fully opened up to the capital that is necessary for land privatisation , for the modernisation of farms and marketing structures and for improving yields .
22.5467	Bulgaria is anxious to join the European Union and NATO .
110.6847	Acute poverty has been a key problem in Romania since 1990 and under the present government , the economy is at last showing real signs of improvement .
123.5032	I call upon the new parliament , which will take up office a fortnight from now , and the new government to make these matters a priority .
983.6791	We must however also point out that the definitive solution , a fair and lasting solution , must fully comply with both the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions , with this being , quite simply , the international law in force , and also the principles governing the European Union .
12.9236	Malta also has stable , working , democratic institutions .
227.9920	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we wish to make our contribution to this debate .
40.2938	I must say , I personally have been particular impressed with the success of Hungary , Estonia and Slovenia here .
80.7074	This change places heavy demands on the people in the candidate countries but , at the same time , it guarantees their future and their children ' s future .
9.6790	Particular attention - and here I agree with the previous speaker - needs to be paid to border regions .
4.1146	The Commission should not be left to fend for itself here .
43.0910	The candidate countries want to experience quick economic growth , even if this is at the expense of previously stipulated nature protection policy .
1.7160	We had a two-way traffic of bad habits , many of them linked to health .
23.3941	. -LRB- ES -RRB- Mr President , enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent .
1136.1062	The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy , which also has competence in the field of transport and the Trans-European Networks , is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different Community sectoral policies in favour of a global policy of regional planning .
4.4108	But first a reminder that transport infrastructure will be instrumental to the success of enlargement .
62.1254	Mr President , I would join the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the main task of the EU .
45.7120	A great deal of pressure has been placed upon traditional social values in the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe .
30.5739	The PPE-DE does not want to take on the responsibility for pacing accession from the candidates because we can not set any dates in this respect .
13.5871	The second point concerns the setting of dates .
8.5918	There is another reason .
265.1350	Thirdly , acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy .
23.6054	Populism is how technocrats choose to denigrate the will of the people when it is expressed in a direction which does not suit them .
51.9825	Ladies and gentlemen , we shall now stop for a break and something to eat and shall resume at 9 o ' clock .
7.8207	Albeit in a somewhat longer time-scale , we shall be obtaining a common currency for the whole continent .
1.5399	Internal battles are being sparked off in the individual countries over these issues .
296.2468	We call on them to fight for a different Europe of all the people , a Europe without this inhumane side , in which people will defend their destiny and live with each other in peace , freedom , comradeship and mutually beneficial cooperation .
1691.2111	I publicly commend the work of these and , in particular , the Romanian Challenge Appeal based in Birmingham and others from Ireland supported by a number of people including Daniel O'Donnell , the Irish entertainer , who has pledged GBP 1 million and has raised that in Ireland and other parts of the world .
74.1540	Above all , the Nice Summit must clarify whether , and how , the EU , for its part , can get itself completely ready for enlargement in good time .
109.2728	The Polish people are asking themselves whether they will receive these payments once they are members of the EU , or whether they are regarded as second-class citizens .
466.7881	However , I am sure that , with good will and the help of the European Union , a solution can be found which will allow the two communities to live together peaceably and prosper , as they have done for centuries .
31.7230	We have also addressed the issue of minorities , because the integration of these minorities - including their linguistic integration - in these countries , is also of significance .
24.4255	The requirement for becoming an EU Member State is that of complying with the basic Copenhagen criteria .
33.3987	We heard about the benefits of enlargement , and this is one of the issues where we can learn from Lithuania .
7.2711	Imagine if they were all like that !
205.9497	Mr President , Commissioner , I too should like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs , but I would mainly like to focus on Slovakia and the policy on minorities , to be more specific .
51.2862	I urge you to set a deadline in Nice by which you intend to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries - naming no names - that have made the most progress .
179.8841	The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress towards joining the Union and , of course , to ensure that the planning of that aid becomes even more decentralised .
43.4545	The dialogue between the social partners , the other groups within civil society , the government and parliament will play an important - and as we see it - positive part in the process .
42.7802	We are just doing away with a divided Europe , and we are not going to create a new one now .
135.9630	All this is to be found in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne , and on behalf of my group , I would like to thank her warmly for this report .
143.4369	In this sense , I think that , if anything , it will be Cyprus on which Europe ' s ability to look itself in the face politically will be judged .
2.4351	I myself live close to the Baltic , which matters to us all .
10.3611	The political vision endures .
676.8123	So it was very cheering to hear Klaus HÃ $ nsch , speaking for the PSE Group , hope that he Commission would make a real appraisal of the effects of enlargement , including the economic impact if enlargement were not to take place .
2747.8578	However , in common with our rapporteur , Mr Wuermeling , I believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods , and being a delegate from a border region , who , like Mrs Schierhuber , owns a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border , it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close , common economic areas should be managed without any major problems , and lead to a positive outcome on both sides .
0.7118	As a Social Democrat , there are three points I would like to highlight .
35.1280	This would mean greater commitment to the implementation of EU legislation than what is required in the present convergence agreements .
67.6778	Secondly , say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group , since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits .
371.0178	Thirdly , we must do our utmost to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process , by 2003 , in the spirit of the splendid speech made by President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
149.7523	I should like to refer to the relations between Parliament and the Council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the Council 's replies to our written questions .
18.4824	It is worrying that this can happen in a country which is going to join the European Union .
4.1030	I ask it to be sent back to committee for preparation .
110.1716	Mr President , today we are to discuss , and perhaps vote on , a total of three reports which deal with this subject , two of them mine .
5.8891	This is something which everyone at each stage in the food chain should in fact help with .
3.4074	There will be a price to pay for safe food at every stage in the chain .
180.2172	We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non-dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers .
34.3948	The 1999 Directive was well thought-out , and it has already scored its first success by demonstrably reducing pollution levels .
5.2116	But it is not the answer simply to permit blending .
3.5922	Very briefly , we must insist on Amendment No 37 , concerning dioxins .
7.0348	On this point we are in agreement .
3571.0455	As a result , we European consumers will find ourselves continuing to buy meat and milk and their derivatives that are produced on the world markets using animal feedingstuffs which are in no way subject to the thresholds and limit values defined by the European Union , under a system which allows raw materials to be acquired on the international markets , where producers are free to mix all types of ingredients and formulations before selling their products on Union territory .
39.3864	By the second reading we need to have the Commission 's view on how the risk assessment will be carried out .
266.6761	However , it would be unfortunate if , for example , Amendments 39 and 40 were adopted , for this would mean that the opportunities for Member States to intervene quickly to combat newly discovered dangers would disappear .
17.9536	Consumer safety begins with animal feed , with its ingredients , the declaration and , last but not least , the official inspections .
205.4662	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Paulsen ' s report on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition deals with an important subject , which , like all important subjects , is highly controversial .
814.2088	The discussion on Mrs Paulsen ' s sound report was emotionally charged at times , and I believe that now , with this discussion behind us , we can assume that , although the requirements prescribed for the feed industry are strict , we can ensure that by admixture , the quality will change in future .
15.5449	Individually and collectively , these three proposals will address major shortcomings brought to light by the dioxin crisis .
4.4447	Amendment No 33 deletes the possibility of exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin .
150.4182	Amendments Nos 41 , 42 , 43 and 44 , proposing to reintroduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of contaminated feed materials are also unacceptable .
39.1938	This should be sufficient , considering our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering all the food and feed chain in the new proposal on the food authority .
54.4398	Commissioner Byrne , in this directive on the marketing of compound feed we find our old problem lurking , namely the question of open declarations .
11.3124	So that in itself has already made my morning .
159.8919	So if we were to do what we intend , if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too , that would certainly be a huge step forward , and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council .
124.7855	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it can still happen , or at least it can not be ruled out , that contaminated primary products will find their way into animal feed again at some future juncture .
10.2900	The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example .
17.4347	Common sense , as our rapporteur said , would suggest that labelling should make a clean sweep and list all the ingredients .
1329.5113	I believe the specialised knowledge and the powers of judgement of the members of the Agriculture Committee on farming matters , and hence on animal nutrition too , are beyond question and that the Agriculture Committee is therefore the body which is best qualified to arrive at a practical and practicable solution that the farmers in question will apply and which consumers will understand .
8.6030	This is the good news .
1.6207	In my opinion , this is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied .
1126.0617	On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries , I would ask you , Madam President , to send Parliament ' s condolences to the families of the victims and to the local authorities in both Brittany and in MarÃn , Galicia , from where the majority of the victims came .
19.1503	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
7.8515	Are there any objections to this oral amendment being tabled ?
6.0728	That is how the rapporteur explained matters to us .
686.7561	Most of the report ' s technical amendments deserve our wholehearted support , for example , those on food safety , the dismantling of first generation nuclear power stations , environmental protection , the fight against social dumping and the crucial code of conduct for Western businesses operating in the East , etc . The task is huge and also a matter of the utmost priority .
7.0069	At the same time , there are still considerable difficulties to overcome , particularly in terms of budgets .
525.8509	Enlargement with the addition of thirteen countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union , but also its structure , because the total population will increase -LRB- by 28 % -RRB- , but so will the number of ` disadvantaged ' regions .
136.4424	We should also do well to remember that , because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output , a competitive agricultural and food-supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries ' transformation and restructuring processes .
943.9863	For this reason , I hope that the outermost regions , six out of seven of which always feature amongst the ten poorest in the EU , benefit from the Structural Funds , no longer just according to the sole criterion of GDP but also according to geographical , demographic and , especially , social indicators .
920.2486	Because we reject this Europe in the interests of the French people , we can not in all conscience endorse its enlargement to include the countries and the peoples of the East , which have only just emerged from Communist dictatorship and can not yet know what a technocratic and totalitarian trap it is that they are wanting to enter .
9.0971	We should have made do with the country reports , adding at most a short , yet succinct resolution .
20.5283	The current system of subsidies , grants and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market .
78.9186	The size and breadth of the problems raised by enlargement are incompatible with the duplicitous language that has been used about it within the European Union .
18.7529	For me , enlargement is not a question of whether to endorse the entry of certain countries into Europe .
19.8257	Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership .
1897.3235	Latvia is entitled to its place in this forum , not only because , on the whole , the progress it has made has earned it the right to this ` allocation of confidence ' that is essential in order to successfully concluded negotiations of this type , but more especially , and above all , because Latvia is at home in Europe as a European country .
716.6102	I feel that , out of all the States which have applied to join the Union , Poland is the one which most deserves our support and our commitment for , without Poland 's crucial initiatives , Communism would not have ended and we would not be discussing this issue today .
16.4427	This is not perhaps quite so obvious to the Polish population which is still generally very Euro-sceptical .
389.2341	I call on Prague to respond to this signal , this challenge , this plea for dialogue , to grant our request and to ensure , together with our House , that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past .
86.3722	I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia 's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws .
27.8538	I welcome this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of the Bulgarian Republic .
309.6832	If Romania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Romania should not be admitted to the Union .
32.6584	Whatever the solution on settlers , and it is a thorny issue along with land restitution on both sides , this is too harsh without giving a qualification .
635.1250	Unfortunately some of the comments made in the draft report on the application by Cyprus for membership of the European Union by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy are not helpful .
104.2722	It is not going to be an easy task , given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot side and of Turkey .
31.1719	Stenzel Report -LRB- A5-0243 / 2000 -RRB-
112.8820	I was , alas , the victim of an - albeit mild - dose of food poisoning , brought on , I regret to say , by eating at the European Parliament .
19.3055	For all these reasons I voted in favour of the ban on dilution proposed by the European Commission .
26.2878	We must urge the ASEM countries in this resolution to pressurise the military regime in Burma to restore democracy .
6.7931	We are partial in our approach and application .
7.1534	This is no time for the faint-hearted .
6.6034	A few important points in the directive are , firstly , the rules on the burden of proof .
10.8265	Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU .
8.4591	'' That is why we need anti-discrimination legislation .
480.0182	Partly thanks to this , we now have a large number of legal , technical amendments before us which aim to guarantee a level of equal protection against discrimination on the basis of race on the one hand and on the basis of religion , handicap , age and sexual orientation on the other .
5.0870	Balance , moderation and legal expertise were required and I believe that his report reflects those qualities .
9.1412	In addition , their view is that cases of discrimination are not so numerous as to warrant any legislation .
154.1655	There is not enough money in the action programme to replace that work which takes place in the fifth framework which will hopefully continue in any other framework programmes , but we need to make sure they work together .
17.7122	Everyone is agreed that discrimination should be fought but opinions differ as to how , to what extent and by what means .
35.2538	In committee , I have had occasion to make a stand against the fact that there may also be experts outside NGOs that have something to say .
55.7343	We are also delighted with the provision in the directive which stipulates that equal treatment for the disabled also means that companies are expected to make the necessary adjustments within the workplace .
0.2671	Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life .
202.4125	After all , as the great democracies of the English-speaking world teach us , racism and discrimination must be fought with liberal democracy , not by restrictions and the gradual erosion of freedom of opinion , freedom of expression , freedom of association and economic freedom .
0.2341	We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same position as holy marriage .
98.4964	We are thereby boosting the positions of the European Union regarding the practical situations experienced by European nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment .
1.9774	I too would like to touch on the issue of exception made for religious organisations .
102.4753	Concerns have been raised with me about the potential interpretation of the explanatory notes to Article 1 , which again may seem a bit obscure , but these distinguish between sexual orientation and behaviour .
8.0444	This is the hierarchy of discrimination .
17.3826	So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour .
1517.5243	These aspects of the directive , together with the fact that , a short time ago , Directive 2000 was adopted , are proof of the avowed will of the European Union to guarantee an open society , free from predetermined categorisations and , most importantly , from the stigma of racism , which has its roots deep in European history .
61.1494	So those who claim here that Europe does not need to lay down in a directive the values which we all aim to defend are mistaken .
8.8804	Do not meddle with these hard-won gains .
5.1032	Finally , ladies and gentlemen , the media must also play an important role in this task .
7.1597	Experience has also shown us that the promotion of anti-discrimination legislation is essential but it is not enough .
68.2165	We must avoid absurd tangles of red tape , which will only succeed in reducing Europe to a purely materialistic , politically correct but pointless entity .
87.0366	In my view , Parliament has overdone it when it comes to the rather restrained legislation which the European Commission would have wanted to submit .
37.3429	I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs , Mr Mann and Mr Cashman , for their quite excellent reports .
25.3499	I will also accept the amendments you have tabled to bring out the importance of preventing discrimination , as well as combating it .
543.1618	The second category aims to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third category consists of a large number of amendments which try to bring this proposal in line with the directive on racial discrimination adopted last June .
80.9951	In particular , Amendments Nos 9 , 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin .
139.7295	I can not accept your references in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and non-formalised groups of persons , as this employment proposal only applies to individuals .
20.3972	The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
14.3357	You can not expect public support for peacemaking operations if our troops face death from weapons which we have ourselves supplied .
27.0506	In my own country I would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed .
33.8763	Another major point is the ban on exporting , promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is , in practice , to be used for the purposes of torture .
25.8776	Having said this , I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Titley on his excellent report .
1111.2017	We must extend our study , on the one hand , not only to matters of binding agreements , but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes , voluntary disarmament , conversion , and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective , and , on the other hand , the applicant countries just mentioned by Mr Wiersma .
3.8743	Monitoring the money circuit is bound to make it more difficult to avoid arms trade regulations .
5.8002	The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements .
91.4523	The European Union is currently considering the continuation of the project beyond its expiry date in November of this year .
8.6205	A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next Research Council .
9.7669	Thank you , Commissioner .
102.2057	As regards the issue of SMEs , we have , of course , been careful to ensure that SMEs play a part in the framework programme , as was stipulated in the budget decision .
143.3842	At least that is what seems to be coming out of the budget debate in Greece , and many people are calling upon the European Union to make its views clear .
11.9036	I share your views on multidisciplinarity .
5.2758	The first is that he specifically mentioned in his statement EU participation in national programmes .
42.3503	There can therefore be no talk of a European Research Area if we are only responsible for 5 % of that research .
22.9265	Thank you very much , Mr Busquin .
642.8895	On the one hand , as a result of the efforts made to commit all the appropriations at the end of 1999 , there was inevitably a very sharp drop in applications for the financing of new projects at the beginning of this financial year .
10.6684	I would , however , reiterate that Portugal did indeed handle matters well in the previous period .
24.1047	Question No 2 by -LRB- H-0730 / 00 -RRB- :
33.6854	Finally , if duties on mineral oils are laid down at a high level , this does not lead to non-compliance with Community regulations in terms of competition .
181.4657	Secondly , as Mr MacCormick knows , where Member States favour by fiscal means a certain sector of industry , they thereby infringe the rules on state aid , in this case fiscal state aid which is akin to a subsidy .
2.9407	For example , nuclear energy is a very clear case in point .
396.4922	Subject : Budget line for minority languages The budget line of the European Union for minority languages was introduced in 1983 and increased steadily to reach a peak in 1995 with EUR 4 million .
1075.2315	Mr President , I am sure my parliamentary colleagues know that the Structural Funds - and this is something new - earmark very substantial funds for cultural activities , for both I and Michel Barnier considered it important to ensure that the Structural Funds do not invest only in roads and airports but also in people .
13.2117	Thus the Commission will not make new financing commitments next year .
28.1592	Where concrete financing proposals are concerned , it is not possible for me to adopt a position here , because we must respect the normal procedures .
5.6352	I have thought of a number of different possibilities .
3.4422	This must be addressed , as we are talking of millions of SMEs throughout Europe .
19.8812	Do the requirements relating to hunting , for example of elk , also cover the treatment of meat for own consumption ?
30.7841	If these rules were to be applied to meat consumed by people within their own households , this would constitute a bureaucratic disaster for elk hunting .
106.5035	When this report has been concluded , I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of insufficient enforcement of the travelling time limits will be addressed .
9.6332	We discussed this issue previously at my meeting with the Green Group .
4.6001	Our question was clear : what measures is the Commission taking ?
5.9015	The general product safety also puts an obligation on producers to provide consumers with information on risks .
22.9796	Maryam Ayubi 's case is extremely disturbing .
24.8560	Question No 14 by -LRB- H-0745 / 00 -RRB- :
709.9191	The EU 's attitude towards that ministerial meeting in Vientiane and indeed , whether it should take place at all , or at what level the EU should be represented at it , will depend on developments in Burma between now and December .
20.6063	One last point .
17.7107	The elections are an important step in involving the people of Kosovo in the running of their own communities .
51.1012	I can tell you that these elections were conducted democratically , and were better than elections in our own countries , which I have happened to take part in or observe on many occasions .
5.1011	But we saw it as a beginning and not by any means the end of the process .
3.7632	It argues in favour of better and stricter controls in the arms trade and greater transparency .
6.8670	Now I find that contracts for arms and components for arms are increasing every year .
1.8244	We can not take practical decisions based on false information and distorted realities .
1.9668	The arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed .
32.0452	While these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor , it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller .
5.1940	This proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as , the Commissioner well knows .
132.2378	So - nothing against an independent , internal audit service , to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten ' s report !
0.2990	Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur .
5.6479	We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management .
9.2229	Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors .
148.7363	In future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner , and of course we also want a better guarantee that the funds are actually spent for the purposes decided by the budgetary authority .
42.7454	Turning now to the proposed amendments , let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital .
4.1145	Let me therefore thank you for your proposals and your opinions .
1561.1981	I would like to summarise the proposals made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms : firstly , the setting up of an group of experts consisting of high-level individuals appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criteria for the protection of minors in the media context ; secondly , the establishment by all the operators in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors ; thirdly , the possibility of promoting filtering systems and making them available for use on both television programmes and the Internet .
9.5978	Unfortunately , I can not endorse the Liberals ' demands .
110.3475	That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation , although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level .
33.1063	But , all other things being equal , I think it is the job of parents to prevent their children from seeing that sort of thing at home .
505.1581	Parents are in particular need of help here , and in the following form : parameters to protect minors in the media context throughout the European Union , the introduction of filter systems available at low cost , legislation to protect minors and assumption of responsibility by the media , enterprises and private and public-sector providers .
132.9169	So when I hear some people stating in debates in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all its forms may have a harmful influence upon children , I am , to put it mildly , surprised .
127.6419	With regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code , it should be noted , particularly in terms of the technical aspects , that , in a number of Member States , broadcasters have already introduced coding systems for television sets to enable parents to cut off the power .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
12.0649	Specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisations by , in effect , repatriating the decisions to the Member States .
41.7653	This is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen .
13.6364	Some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996 .
93.6553	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work .
26.6212	I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments put forward by Mr Evans .
21.3964	Our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge .
32.8798	It is through practical action and not through green or white papers or , for that matter , black or red ones , that problems are solved .
27.3833	However , as is its proper role , Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers to be included in the text nonetheless .
4.9502	Your visit today comes at what is a crucial time for European integration .
29.2568	Yet , as we know , the process is incomplete and , as such , it is not firing on all four cylinders .
156.9035	If we do not make this clear now , in this sensitive , turbulent passage of European and world history , when will we be able to ?
268.2903	None of us can claim to know , here and now , exactly when and in what order we will achieve these goals , but we do all know that , if we firmly believe in and desire these things , then we will already be halfway to success .
314.5235	We must make sure women benefit from the new jobs generated , while avoiding reproducing the inequalities that exist in more traditional sectors : less skilled jobs , part-time work -LRB- sometimes not by choice -RRB- , insecure contracts and difficulties put in the way of access to decision-making posts .
1.7465	A proposal on indicators to measure progress will be put before the Council .
56.9308	Finally , in a word , the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines .
79.4632	I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer , one of my priorities for government action , and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too .
418.2064	We know that measures for combining family and working life particularly favour women , although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it , which is no longer the traditional role , because society has changed a great deal , and at the same time , so has family structure .
21.9755	Sometimes , some people - even colleagues in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities , but they do not .
1.7808	I should like to conclude by saying that equality begins in the home .
81.5934	I find that position awkward and ambiguous , and I think that means more thought is required on the drafts you are presenting to us , because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results .
5.8859	In that area , there is no equality .
169.0559	The image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women , the majority of whom are saying no to the euro .
47.5980	I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society , for example in the labour market .
12.3180	This is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity .
41.1505	The Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart .
11.1921	We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality .
352.3255	Women ' s average salaries are still lower than men ' s , by around 28 % on average , which is a contributory factor to women making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life .
10.0857	That is really excellent .
353.7079	Today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning women all over Europe , including France , where 15 % of them live on less than FRF 3 650 a month .
18.4914	Not all countries have managed to follow France ' s example , which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere .
6.3318	Of course the history of feminism is very long .
3.4085	The candidates really must be helped to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire .
7.7088	However , I need your help here .
332.8525	That is not the case , but it is a satisfactory text and , having given it great thought and following an extensive debate , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments .
2136.4398	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , following a long debate , considered that it was not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six years , and that three years , which is the period set , is a more reasonable period of time for establishing , with the appropriate means and the average proceedings , whether or not there were irregularities in a declaration .
13.7564	It is Amendment No 15 , on fraud .
1050.2595	The goal to achieve simplified yet quality communication whilst building in a sufficient level of flexibility with regard to the basic rules , thus improving the procedure for collecting duties and offering a higher degree of adjustment of the provisions with regard to offering goods at customs , meets one of the requirements of the single market , and that has been achieved in this case , so much so , in fact , that many countries have drawn on this model in order to speed up the process to be able to take part in international trade .
248.9904	It would like to thank Parliament and the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio , in particular , for the efforts made and interest shown by Parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier .
15.6684	Welcome
16.6832	I trust this will not change the way we vote , but the French translation really must be checked .
7.8221	Mr President , I voted in favour of the Evans report .
3.0680	Knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility .
21.3186	We also believe that , to a great extent , the Member States themselves should be allowed to decide on the taxes to be collected .
37.6680	I was slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents .
210.1910	During the Treaty of Amsterdam negotiations we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of sex , racial or ethnic origin , religion or belief , disability , age and sexual orientation .
55.9261	My final comment relates to the budget for this programme , EUR 98.4 million . That figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged .
204.3836	It is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in Member States , which , in any case , are fully justified for reasons of psychological development , and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market .
15.6344	I also think that we can do without the entire contents of the new Article 12 -LRB- a -RRB- .
2.6107	On religion/belief , the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection on these grounds .
29.8384	Broadly speaking , the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality .
30.8685	But this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department .
297.7522	The EU has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objectives -LRB- crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU -RRB- , but it has no common defence policy .
6.2133	The world would be a safer place without weapons .
47.1763	The resolution is not seeking to reduce arms sales radically to promote a policy of disarmament , but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profits for the industrial groups .
977.5403	The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but proposes no specific measures because it is blinkered by the philosophy of market liberalisation and competition , and any proposals which it makes fail to get to the heart of the harsh reality - a reality especially harsh on children - of the unaccountability of multinationals which , in their lust for profit , are indifferent to the impact which their programmes and products have and which not only shift the entire responsibility to parents but even expect them to buy new products to protect their children .
45.4251	Like the rapporteur , I believe measures intended to protect young people from violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television but should apply to all media .
72.6051	With viewing averaging three hours per day , it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adults - work .
29.6380	Moreover , women are often in ` flexible ' jobs ; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority .
146.1530	They are the first to fall foul of cuts in public spending , privatisation of the health sector , the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programmes .
1209.1058	B5-0792 / 2000 , by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , on the crisis in Peru .
295.1179	Mr President , I would prefer it if , for once , we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussions in the committees , rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other .
218.7658	We must ensure that , when Peru reaches its goal , it has candidates who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the Peruvian people 's demand for political renewal and genuine democracy .
9.7635	The joint debate is closed .
273.2760	We know Afghanistan is not far away , and we know it is the world ' s largest producer of opiates , so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias , which are not necessarily simply political , in the expansion of the drug trade .
66.1765	It calls on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone .
7.2582	Terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict .
29.5616	There has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now .
471.8524	I would like to take the opportunity to say , in response to Mrs Paciotti ' s comment , that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today as to what has become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it .
1076.3926	B5-0794 / 2000 , by Mr Medina Ortega , Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas ;
0.4183	Unfortunately , we all hoped that we would not have to discuss Colombia again .
305.0597	The Commission has already offered to coordinate the measures for a package of this kind , and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few days .
3.1418	So , once again , we have double standards and I think that is deplorable .
184.1000	I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party , which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia .
48.6111	In my view , it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders .
139.3106	Therefore , I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable , but that the government , which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues , needs visible signs of its success , and powerful support , else peace throughout the region will be under threat .
333.2856	The PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year , i.e. in 2001 and 2002 .
19.2875	I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation .
150.7502	And because all this concerns Greece , which has the biggest shipping sector in the European Union , it basically concerns the safety of all types of shipping throughout the Union .
180.5801	In recent years many other lives have been lost at sea in our waters , not only by way of major ferry disasters but , on all too frequent a basis , from amongst our fishing communities .
5.6987	On the contrary , innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners ' wider objectives .
45.8820	We must be aware that when something like this happens , the credibility of the European Union also comes into play .
603.8198	Finally , I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community .
1359.1924	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , excuse me for having arrived a little late , for reasons that you are well aware of , in order to make a brief declaration on the two matters on the agenda : the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general , and the situation in the Middle East .
279.9702	Like Mr Solana , Commissioner Verheugen will be speaking on the two issues on our agenda this afternoon , which is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia .
7.6965	We must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected .
4834.2280	Madam President , Mr Solana , Commissioner , I take part in this debate with certain reservations because I do not want this Parliament giving the impression that it is sitting in judgment , casting anathema on this or that person when , after such great hopes were raised here only a month ago , we face the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East .
541.9371	Madam President , my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week , because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbances took place .
35.8355	While condemning all forms of violence , we can not make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence .
1409.9887	I would like to ask Parliament at this critical hour to issue a statement of support for the brave people who have , today , defended freedom and liberty in the streets of Belgrade , echoing the support which we Europeans gave not many years ago to sustain those people in other capitals who were also fighting for their freedom .
233.7387	Madam President , there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council .
7.4448	The position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations .
217.8298	He has managed for years , with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media , to deceive the people in his own country and , unfortunately , many in the western world , to whom he has misrepresented the real situation .
267.7613	As the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament , as a symbol of united free Europe , to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate .
170.2871	Precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst - and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago .
756.7929	I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people , and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today .
56.7840	The European Parliament wishes to express its total solidarity with them at this historic time , as tyranny crumbles and democracy emerges triumphant .
7043.3590	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0237 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr SeppÃ $ nen , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia -LRB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000/0122 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RRB- .
9.2270	We must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there , following the legislative and presidential elections .
118.7557	Between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place , whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations .
217.3138	Let us not forget that , until recently , Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand , and which benefited only one individual .
791.3991	The contribution under discussion , which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007 , may not prove to be a milestone , but it would certainly help the process on its way .
2.0350	It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation .
138.6951	When half a century ago , Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time , they became vassals of the Hitler regime .
157.2811	Of course we can not consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade .
298.9551	When it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed , we hope that action to establish normal relations and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracies will only be days away .
10.8472	I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000 .
17.2930	-LRB- The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence -RRB-
0.6870	My question is : Who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this Statute ?
1907.0623	I ask you , Madam President , to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation , in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection .
27.3551	The autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he was the victim of murder and had , in all probability , been tortured .
67.1297	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream , one I do not , however , personally share .
16.3493	This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants .
2.7995	He is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m. -RRB-
4397.7569	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0291 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Van Lancker , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission communication to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000/2219 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB- .
532.3084	Stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation , because we should lay down social rights in Europe too . We should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market .
384.7072	In our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society , especially women ' s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family , because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe .
1.8561	The areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement .
248.9810	Let me , at this point , remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz , which I shall be chairing .
698.0339	At the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October , a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion , which will serve as a foundation for national action plans .
14.2317	I have heard from some quarters that having read the report , they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription .
52.3861	Technological development and new methods of organisation call , of course , for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation .
55.9269	It is in this area that we can , in our opinion , find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market .
14.5367	This has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad .
2.8691	The method used , on the other hand , seems more debatable .
101.6122	In discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we can not shy away from certain issues : we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken , even if this means producing more accurate legislation .
92.2931	I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work , employee participation and labour relations .
31.3678	Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the Commissioner and Mrs PÃ © ry on this presentation of the social agenda .
49.5983	These are points which , we know , are contested by the conservatives in Europe , but to which we , in our Group , attach great importance .
13.7648	The third strand in the content is enlargement .
15.6325	The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m .
294.7360	The Commission ' s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions , an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours .
113.6406	Women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme .
101.3941	We expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission , within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament .
25.9683	I am delighted , moreover , that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life .
1.7505	This is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
111.7681	I find the Commission ' s new approach to be a very positive one , and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered .
149.1816	I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women ' s Rights .
1418.3519	Firstly because , in the course of last year , I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers , especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission ' s ruling .
535.7900	I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public , efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and , in the same vein , when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality .
75.3010	I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial services sector .
6.7617	This does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy ; it applies right across the board .
346.8716	Commissioner Monti , on behalf of the Italian Radicals , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced , which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition .
25.5267	I stress this point because the market can not regulate everything , which is why competition is not completely unrestricted , nor should it be .
224.4231	Mr President , today no one disputes , and of course I am not going to do so , the fact that state aid alters the conditions for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings .
129.5166	Hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998 , even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction , is already bizarre , to say the least .
1258.4825	And obviously , Mr President , although my opinion refers to the Commission ' s 29th report on competition policy , it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past , but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future .
198.2349	Mr President , in the time available to me , I would like to focus on the following three points : the modernisation of Community competition law , the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid .
10.6379	The Commission has continued to intervene resolutely , particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned .
284.8199	Mr Rapkay , it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away .
1925.0766	This mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation , currently Denmark , the United Kingdom and Sweden .
0.4268	In future , recourse to the capital market should be the only option available .
157.2378	I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report as it stands , and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material .
74.2851	It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress , particularly in the field of in vitro propagation .
51.4145	I also feel that , abiding by this precautionary principle , referring to the possibility of genetic modification , means , for example , cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments .
2288.4990	In conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter , should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn , then , as the wine growers themselves demand , we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler BÃ © guin , and the Committee on the Environment , and vote against them .
520.3330	Mr President , if you permit , I should like to ask the Commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , Amendment No 1 .
338.1106	The only issue open to debate is whether or not I should have taken note of the decree terminating Mr Le Pen ' s mandate as soon as the French government notified me of it .
2.9242	I would remind you that the vote is to take place at 12.30 .
24.3821	In the field of justice and home affairs , I am optimistic that a solution will be found concerning judicial cooperation in civil cases .
44.5475	The preparatory group is to play a full role up until 19 November , the date of the next ministerial level meeting .
239.0911	We needed this invigorating climate , as Mr Moscovici has said , and I too sensed among the Heads of State and of Government a very solemn air of collective and historic responsibility at this historic juncture for European integration .
145.9524	Ladies and gentlemen , we must quite simply see to it that from now on we keep alive the spirit and climate of Biarritz as regards these qualified majority voting issues .
13.5635	The small countries are not there to take orders from the large countries of the European Union .
0.2290	I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point .
0.5586	On the one hand , the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event .
258.4831	Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , while progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting , deep-seated disagreement persists , as you yourself have underlined , concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in Council .
2.6177	It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction .
16.9206	Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car .
146.9643	I am no more qualified than you to meddle in German internal affairs , but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if I am not mistaken also moves into line with what the Commission wants .
29.0615	We have started to exchange ideas on this question , from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement .
7.7018	I do not think it will happen .
60.0003	Firstly , one sometimes had the impression that at Biarritz there was an obsession with the debate between the smaller and the larger states .
5.1936	On this count , I consider it insufficient to say that the Community method must be safeguarded .
59.8468	Even once the present candidate countries have joined , each Member State must be able to retain one junior or senior Commissioner .
343.0743	The wording of Article 93 becomes all the more critical considering that , once the first wave of new states has joined the Union , it will be all the more difficult for us to progress towards qualified majority voting .
19.5043	One has to convince the citizens in these countries of the clear merits of any new European treaty .
76.7365	We would be failing to understand the origins of this crisis if we imagined that fears which have reigned for generations were to give way to lasting peace , a prelude to reconciliation , without further ado .
3.4555	I am also worried by the minimum response to Parliament ' s call for democratisation .
8.5178	It is , rather , those who are demanding extensive reforms prior to enlargement who are guilty of that .
492.9829	On the one hand , there is the decision by the head of the Israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition , Mr Sharon .
68.1408	Needless to say , we in this Parliament can only rejoice at the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica as President .
1306.1068	I would advise Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain to him why they are in government in Italy with an openly Communist party and why they are preparing to go to the political elections with another openly Communist party , the Communist Refoundation Party .
1.7382	This is precisely where we must advance the cause of the codecision procedure .
50.0828	The Commission , having the option of simple majority voting , would be better equipped to provide this impetus in the future .
819.1279	The Union does not now need visionaries with tunnel vision leading up to the year 2030 , but problem-solvers that can see the problems that enlargement over the next 3 to 8 years will bring with it , and see the solutions to them .
15.9001	We are thus talking about an open piece of work which has not fallen from on high or been imposed from above .
9.4548	That concludes the debate .
16.6076	Without this fundamental point of reference , at best there is mutual lack of understanding and at worst there is mutual killing .
8.9768	Democracy in Europe is in good health , but European democracy is in a bad way .
420.0664	Today , the 24 October 2000 , in Strasbourg , the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly : the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want .
4.6990	It expresses the idea , that is , that island status is in itself an adequate criterion .
115.9204	Let me go to the heart of the matter , focussing on the salient points of Mr Gil-Robles ' report , which I shall simply describe as excellent in my view .
8.5528	Firstly , simplification and clarification of the Treaties .
27.0385	I shall not continue , as we are not here , or I , at least , am not here , to discuss the Institute ' s report .
548.2277	According to the information available to the Presidency , forgive me if I have to be technical at this point , it appears that the clear majority of the language versions , unlike the Italian version , as far as the implementation of cohesion policy is concerned , refer only to the less favoured islands and not to islands in general .
523.0824	Mr Duhamel , you will undoubtedly agree with me that if Nice is not successful , there will be no room , or at least no credibility , for consideration of the future of European integration , at least within the current framework .
770.1804	What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union , inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed , and provide for joint action to be taken , for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
3.2088	It may also prove essential if we are to overcome persistent obstacles .
8.2869	A clearer distribution of powers is required , as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle .
15.2262	As is well known , opinion on this differs widely in the various Member States and amongst the various forces of society .
26.5627	Unfortunately , the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite , and so , of course , we can not vote for it .
58.9669	In the enhanced European house , some nations will be sitting at the military , monetary , and possibly tax , tables , and others will be left out .
534.4481	Obviously the second version is incorrect , first because regions lagging behind economically are , in any case , covered by the Structural Funds and , secondly , because if this interpretation were correct , there would have been no point in adopting declaration No 30 .
444.3685	Mr President , I shall focus my scant sixty seconds on the report by Mr Duhamel , which is a good report , because it has the courage to state things clearly and the eloquence of our rapporteur just now has finally convinced us .
2.6859	In my view , the unity of Europe can not but be political .
22.6624	In our opinion , the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections .
600.8752	Consequently , the description `` less developed '' is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and , according to Mr Barnier ' s proposal , what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty , in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
0.2392	Since the honourable Member said she would vote against , this amendment is repealed .
0.2278	Mr President , what is being asked for here is a recipe for chaos .
43.2981	I welcome the EP ' s adoption of the Trakatellis report as it provides for the setting of high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives .
124.9834	If European parliamentary immunity is independent , the French authorities ought to have consulted us regarding the waiver of Mr Le Pen ' s immunity .
30.2567	I am particularly disappointed at the European Parliament ' s vote on the report on the reproduction of vine plants .
94.0546	To some , alcohol , like tobacco and drugs , is a product which can cause a great deal of harm to the users and the people around them ; to others , it is mainly a source of employment which can generate large sums of money .
64.0050	The rapporteur generally welcomes the proposals in the Commission White Paper on this subject but is apprehensive of the possible implications of the reform , which aims principally to decentralise the implementation of competition rules .
334.5379	During the debate yesterday evening , I welcomed the work of Mr Evans , but I was immediately bound to express my deep disagreement with the rather too liberal , not to say ultraliberal , tenor of his report .
290.9967	IDA Ireland has been reorganising that focus so as to win half of all new jobs from Greenfield Projects in the Objective 1 region over the coming three years .
44.6295	Sometimes , when the consequences of this policy cause an outcry , state intervention , aid and other economic and fiscal incentives come along and go some way to restoring the situation .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 2.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. -RRB-
85.2541	So here we are in October 2000 , with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed .
19.7281	But that did not stop the Council from cutting agricultural expenditure by a total of EUR 555 million .
89.9457	In addition , naturally we take the view that it would not be acceptable simply to create 400 additional jobs , i.e. on top of those already in existence .
2.4327	All I can say to the Council is : follow our example .
5.4602	Hence the administration of this House is there to serve the delegates , and not vice versa .
8.3820	The European Court of Auditors is giving us the least cause for concern at present .
5.3573	Finally , we also handle the Ombudsman ' s budget .
15.4509	On the contrary , we feel that there should be increased efforts in research , particularly in view of the candidate countries .
0.4713	Furthermore , we propose that Parliament should be kept informed on a regular basis .
631.2836	When a legislative conciliation takes place on social , cultural or environmental issues - and the Commissioner will recognise that I am right - the Commissioner for Budgets , the Ministers for Finance and the members of the Committee on Budgets all pray that a financial blunder will not occur .
5.3986	Mr President , honourable Members , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your welcome .
433.8786	The Council voted through , at the first reading , the appropriations that it felt to be justified for 2001 , without taking into consideration any tactical concerns would only work against the objective of the sound allocation of appropriations , which is the objective that the Community institutions must pursue .
257.2292	Before you reach your decision on this draft budget , I would like to emphasise that the Council and Parliament share a number of objectives on which agreement could well be reached by our two arms of the budgetary authority .
5.2860	We are in a similar situation as regards structural policy .
875.3092	The conciliation process which took place in the summer - Mr Colom i Naval made this point - had a positive outcome too , in that , in future , there will be an increase in the information made available to Parliament , and all new legislative proposals must be accompanied by an estimate of their compatibility with the financial forecasts .
197.4037	I would remind you that the financial plan for the Balkans agreed last year only made provision for EUR 1.85 billion for the entire period up to 2006 .
58.5412	I would again urge you - the Commission is leaving your proposal on the table - to examine this proposal without bias and consider it as a possibility .
17.8843	The material was obviously useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge .
7092.4184	As much as I , as a member of the Committee on Budgets , appreciate the work undertaken by this committee , and as impressed as I am by the labours of the Committee on Budgets ' rapporteurs , as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , it is imperative that I highlight two proposed amendments , which the committee is resubmitting to the plenary , and which are by no means insignificant , despite the small amounts involved .
300.1295	In implementing these measures , we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order , restore people ' s faith in the legal certainty of the EU , and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law .
41.4247	The Commission ' s attempt to abolish this initiative showed out-and-out disregard for the political will of Lisbon and the priorities of this House .
173.1534	This was an astonishing decision and left many of us feeling that this whole very important programme had simply become a football in a game between the Budgets Committee and the Commission .
28.6804	The third point pertains to European agricultural policy as it is now before us in the budget proposals .
68.7894	Whilst employment may be the European Union ' s priority policy , fisheries , as another economic sector , can not remain on the sidelines .
472.8287	I am especially glad that we have been able to safeguard financing for the Socrates , Youth and Culture 2000 programmes that were decided at the end of last year .
54.6406	For example , with regard to our aid to Mediterranean countries , we have a backlog which has accumulated over many years of budgets .
412.5677	Mr President , in previous years ' debates I spoke for the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , where we heard from Mrs Iivari this afternoon .
442.4599	But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends just 1 % of GDP and much of that is administered in the Member States .
8.1511	Let me turn to the overall strategy .
66.5455	This brings me to our group ' s strategy , because at the core of our belief is the wish to get value for money for the European citizen .
67.5589	On the contrary , we must work for a Parliament which campaigns for openness , efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions .
4.2364	And so we must think about how to solve this problem .
54.9881	We want to drive democratisation processes forward , and we want to strike a balance between the traditional political fields of foreign policy now before us .
5.0200	The most difficult problems in the new budget concern external action .
10.7995	Naturally there is a need to budget carefully , we support this and should not try to get round it .
248.5219	This is a truly extraordinary initiative , especially at first reading , and one that is bound to be unsuccessful , for in the present circumstances it can not possible gain a majority of votes in favour .
9.6969	That being the case , the level of funding allocated to Kosovo is not without certain problems .
12.2175	Budget policy needs to instil public confidence in European policy .
0.2521	We must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises .
10.1902	the level of budgetary implementation ;
249.2607	By preserving this strategic approach in the way we address the budget this year and in years to come , the European Parliament will fully play its role in the budgetary process .
24.0678	With the transfer of EUR 175 million we have estimated EUR 25 million more than we expected .
76.0775	As regards MEDA , the Council said that the commitments are not a problem owing to the eight years of payment backlogs .
35.2901	I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz .
9.5169	My answer is very simple .
429.8874	Ramiro Zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and , recently , the Colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups ' `` Plan 100 '' to kill one hundred human rights activists .
910.5310	I am a bit happier with the attitude of the Council today than I was in July because , as on many occasions in situations of crisis , the European Union seems always to be the last authority to arrive on the international scene and make its voice heard .
1726.7252	The question , Mr President , and I shall end here , is whether there is a solution that would exert greater pressure than that proposed by the President in his statement and whether the aid we are going to give will be entirely different from that of the United States , in other words , not intended for crop-spraying , but for crop replacement and also for social , rather than military , purposes .
10.1580	The questions that I and other Members asked are very specifically related to the situation in Colombia .
208.9439	As they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 will be taken together .
2723.4816	Subject : Tax on financial transactions In recent months there have been growing calls for a tax on financial speculation , with ATTAC committees -LRB- association for a tax on financial transactions and aid for citizens -RRB- springing up in France and Europe , as well as the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and Senate .
1198.8067	I should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets , particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50 % .
48.8823	In paragraph 26 , moreover , it called for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation to cancel the debts of the countries of the South .
39.8490	Indeed this is what has happened in the case of the euro over the year , whether we like it or not .
11505.3122	Further to the comment which Danielle Auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the South , I would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures , for instance , a range between USD 50 and 250 billion , which could be recovered by a Tobin-type tax , whereas , at the same time , the UNDP -LSB- United Nations Development Programme -RSB- amounts to USD 40 billion per annum , which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world .
15.0881	In recent months the disease has been detected , inter alia , in various areas of France .
2853.1915	Now I would like to ask , while the French representative of the country holding the presidency is here , whether this slaughter of cows will be paid for out of the EU budget or will you be paying for them out of your national budget , and whether , in your opinion , it is indeed appropriate that they should be paid for out of the EU budget .
6.8875	I beg your indulgence to hear the answer please .
0.4187	Any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law .
26.9228	It escapes me how the Commission can give this estimate as early as February and the Council in July .
329.2875	By acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity , the Union is , in actual fact , shirking one of its responsibilities , as it has in recent weeks both in northern Italy and in Spain .
886.6224	As an MEP who cares about that majority , how can I endorse the spending of GBP 11.5 billion of UK taxpayers ' money - that is our current annual contribution - when it does not have broad public approval ?
30.6327	If the Council took a flexible position , we could reach an agreement at second reading in order to close the budget .
5.9813	If anyone needs convincing , just look at the evidence .
8.9659	This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval , the Vice-President for buildings .
1874.5741	As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned , there are many political announcements coming out of this year ' s Budget : the reorganisation of agricultural policy , new structural programmes , measures to ensure better implementation of the structural policy , and steps designed to follow up the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for creating a stronger and more competitive EU and for combating social exclusion .
0.4695	The NATO war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake .
85.8507	Despite what has been agreed , I sometimes wonder if it is possible to achieve this objective within existing budget constraints without undermining the agricultural budget necessary for a sustainable rural sector in existing Member States .
1748.3911	And I am telling you loud and clear : Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months , but meanwhile , I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines , democratisation and reconstruction , to be accompanied by political conditions , both from a political and budgetary perspective .
146.2738	The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things : that the people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and that they have confidence in Professor Kostunica .
3.7406	I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released soon .
69.8756	If the financial perspective is not revised , we will inevitably be caught up in `` financial engineering '' , in redeploying resources and in cuts , either in general expenditure , social and environmental spending or in cooperation .
5.0223	In this connection , efforts are required to solve the major social problems , for example unemployment .
579.2438	There is , of course , one crucial event , namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it , but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this , partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes .
8.6734	Prioritising is important in all Budget work .
65.3192	This is not very serious with the expiry of the Treaty very close on the horizon , but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework maintained the possibility of prolonging such practices .
10.8293	That leads to my third remark on what now faces us .
16.0626	The new Finance Agreement is of no use , and I see that mistrust of EU politicians is growing .
6.8656	I pay tribute to them for that .
136.4099	The willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which , it is my fervent hope , will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading .
395.3860	Those of us who stand for European values in a Eurosceptic country are now being given further arguments in favour of the EU , namely more effective protection of privacy , which is important for the citizens of a modern society .
192.0502	I now see that my own country is to alter the law relating to personal data which deprives elected representatives of any influence at all over the Commission ' s decisions .
5.2585	There are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable .
305.1298	The Commission would first and foremost like to highlight the commitment we made to the citizens of Europe to ensure protection of the personal data processed by the institutions of Europe .
46.4524	If this statement is made , the Commission will accept the scope of the regulation being limited exclusively to first pillar activities .
4997.9826	In order to honour the political agreement made with the Council and the rapporteur to enable the regulation to be adopted at first reading , the Commission rejects all other amendments which were not part of the Paciotti report adopted by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , except for Amendment No 69 which is a correction to Amendment No 41 .
2620.9506	As a matter of urgency , therefore , the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied , when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact .
304.5875	From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , what I would like to point out is that , in actual fact , we can only treat equally what is equal .
4.9123	Given the importance of fisheries to the outermost regions , I can only be saddened by this .
384.4423	So far , since an interdepartmental group was set up for the outermost regions under the presidency of Mr Delors , we have travelled a long and fruitful road , and I must express the deepest gratitude of the Europeans from the outermost regions to those who have presided over that group .
3263.7520	The fact is , even though , as early as the Treaty of Rome , reference was made to the French overseas departments , we had to wait until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of these regions , the notorious POSEI programmes , for the European Union to at long last acknowledge that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps affecting the outermost regions justified special treatment in comparison with the other regions of the Community .
29.7274	I have no doubt but that the proposals which the Commission will submit to the Council will be characterised by these qualities .
7.6020	This question will become that much more relevant the closer EU enlargement towards the East becomes .
58.4110	It should be noted that this right to be different is nothing more than a demonstration of the principle of equality , which also requires different treatment for anything that is different .
97.8339	It is a document which my team and I feel is full of ideas and proposals , which goes to the heart of the issues and does not dodge any of the areas of concern of the peoples of the outermost communities .
5.3364	Your report , Mrs Sudre , quite rightly stresses the need to take long-term action .
11.7004	As for the revival of the diversification of the economy , we have made progress in a number of key areas .
296.8913	The important thing now is that a good number of projects are presented under the SPDs , but also , alongside this grass-roots action , we must consider in depth the specific needs of each of the outermost regions in relation to access to the information society .
25.9070	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
0.1865	I will , of course , inform the President of what you have said .
39.9913	I am concerned about the possibility of a general failure of numerous machines and rules which would then call the decisions of the House into question .
52.9244	Both this food authority and the legislative proposals being proposed , which aim to guarantee food safety , will receive the support of this House , Commissioner .
7.5865	Its key task is providing scientific advice , for the discussion on food safety must be pure too .
24.6967	I would just like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take on board the recommendations from other Committees .
5.1167	When we are faced with a potential risk , it is important to apply the precautionary principle .
466.1018	On the still vexed question of how far we should go in allowing it to look at nutrition , and indeed to offer advice and to be consulted by those whose primary concern is risk management , we have also said that where the issue of safety is involved , these issues also should at least be within the remit of the opinion and the advice of this food standards authority .
5.3433	A central aspect of this is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions can be preserved .
34.5964	This respectability will be gained , not through laws or legislation , but through integrity , academic brilliance , neutrality , duty to be accountable , transparency and comprehensibility .
21.2226	Sound scientific knowledge is certainly essential to help assess the risks linked to the food chain , from the farm to the table .
170.8929	Mr President , it is clear that there is considerable enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency , as our rapporteur would prefer to call it .
344.9652	Given that the WHO programme remains properly funded and supported , there would appear to be no need whatsoever for yet another agency , especially one with such a limited reach as the 15 Member States of the European Union .
22.3311	Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers , because they want to eat healthily , and we have to ensure that this is possible .
1.8773	Without a new framework directive we will be helpless in many areas of food safety .
331.8409	We must consequently make such changes to the EU Treaty as to ensure that the Commission is given the option of imposing sanctions in the area of food , just as it has at present in the area of competition .
23.4820	I support everyone involved , be it in a political , administrative or other capacity , who is working on a `` food for all '' strategy .
11.3133	I do not share this viewpoint , for we know that a human being is more than just a body .
96.8924	It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which , in turn , must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions .
11.1042	I therefore believe that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly reconcilable .
26.7645	The reform of European Union food laws would be carried out at the level of the European Union .
4.6260	His report does not so much propose amendments as establish emphases .
6.1767	We have spelled this out very clearly in the report , and I am absolutely delighted about it .
7.3910	Yet , the creation of a European Food Safety Agency is a very positive step .
18.6228	In the interests of the citizens of the Union as a whole , it is to be hoped that these criteria will be implemented .
49.6216	I think there should be specific deadlines by which the European Commission must be notified if there is any cause for concern .
0.4290	The EU must have the highest possible standards of food safety for its citizens .
7.5285	The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency .
41.0132	I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action .
10.1053	As we create new levels of bureaucracy and spend ever more money we get less and less in return .
4.6750	You must prevent several institutions carrying out similar work in parallel .
454.8968	We must , however , ensure that in the wake of the debate on the White Paper , the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which concerns itself with the quality of products without doing anything effective to combat fraud that threatens the health of the consumer is not reinforced in the mind of the public .
5.2096	As you are aware , the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety .
176.2331	The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the overarching principles and objectives of food law , which will provide the framework for future health protection measures relating to food .
9.1178	Thank you very much , Commissioner .
1415.4315	Turning to our report , I welcome the Commission 's proposal as positive , and I have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have worked extremely hard in order to improve it - if this was possible - on certain points in particular .
56.4980	As Mrs Bonino said , very clearly and explicitly , the Commission 's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward .
7.2693	The Commission ' s draft regulation seems too vague .
102.6690	Proper mine-clearance equipment therefore needs to be arranged and we need to finance research work on detection and clearance , and on equipment that is simple to use on the ground , which is particularly helpful for developing countries .
77.2045	Over the last eight years we have contributed over EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against landmines .
2.8611	But we can not penalise people when they have a lousy government .
263.2228	Firstly , as I have already mentioned , I think it would be a mistake , well-intentioned but nevertheless counter-productive , to make accession to the Ottawa Convention a hard and fast condition for European mine-action assistance .
16.0596	I can not accept Amendment No 19 .
21.8881	Secondly , the international community needs to improve the coordination of its efforts both at the global level and particularly within the afflicted countries .
263.5439	Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists shares the pride which Mr van Orden expressed a moment ago in the role of the European Union .
13.5465	Think of the Soviet ` toy ' bombs in Afghanistan .
8.6085	Thank you for a good report .
8.5674	Mr President , the Cambodians call mines ` everlasting sentinels ' .
3.8249	People have a justified mistrust of uniformed personnel , born of many years of war .
344.5939	Mr President , I am pleased that we finally have European legislation , in the form of a regulation , on anti-personnel landmines and that today we have a good report on the subject by Mrs Bonino .
11.7470	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing a very sad subject today .
65.6371	It is no coincidence that most mines are to be found in crisis areas , i.e. in areas where a different sort of initiative could have been taken in order to resolve the crisis .
174.4508	Two kilometres away from a hamlet in Bosnia , in 1999 , a sign indicated the presence of mines in a field , but this did not stop a little boy going there .
11.1773	It is tragic when the civil population suffers as a result of its leaders ' lack of skills and experience .
166.1494	Allow me to welcome you on behalf of our institution , with which your country maintains privileged relations within the context of our joint project to construct an area of prosperity , safety and peace in the Mediterranean basin .
7.9419	All the mines are in storage .
37.6454	Mr President , as I agree with almost everything my colleagues have said , I do not want to repeat it , so I shall give up my speaking time .
3.7407	Your concept of open cooperation is a reversion to an institutional system dominated by Commission officials .
14.0919	We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions must be made as close as possible to those they affect .
128.0847	However , as the Group of the European People 's Party 's key amendments have just obtained a substantial majority , I have voted for the report .
1055.1073	Mr President , I abstained from voting on the resolution on the results of the informal Biarritz European Council for two reasons : firstly , because I had the opportunity to vote in person on Paragraphs 2 and 5 separately , which allowed me to express my total opposition to both .
151.4920	In other words , among those sitting round the table of the common European home , some would eat Ã la carte while others would get the dish of the day .
333.9347	There is always room for improvement , of course , and democratic control must not be found wanting in this respect , but we did not feel that cataloguing these rights and including them in the Treaties should be the European Union 's top priority .
8.1222	There has been talk about referenda and the amendments that were made to this report in relation to referenda .
552.3236	Only 40 per cent of people voted in the 1999 elections to the European Parliament , if countries with voting duties are discounted , as well as those which had national elections at the same time as elections to the European Parliament .
25.9793	To achieve the desirable objective of a European Constitution it is inadvisable to impose rigid patterns and methods , which would inevitably lead to failure .
27.6531	A genuine social constitution ought to bring together , from the top down , the best acquired rights for work , women , immigrants and citizens .
432.7240	Although I do not reject the praiseworthy intention of strengthening , clarifying and deepening the European Union and of simplifying the texts so as to bring its workings closer to the citizens , I did not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution .
9.9538	the allocation of powers and responsibilities
125.9441	I believe it is absolutely crucial that the EU ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights should involve subscribing to the Council of Europe 's Convention on Human Rights .
318.1806	However , Mr Gil-Robles ' report is a help in this respect because it proposes that , for certain issues and sectors , some of the Member States of the European Union reach agreement upon joint actions .
30.2413	To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards .
30.5831	It is now attempting to prevent reinforced cooperation being made more flexible , but here too it will eventually lose .
68.9020	The report before us tends to consolidate Parliament ' s position in this respect -LRB- resolution of 13 April 2000 -RRB- .
6.9453	We are broadly in favour of so-called flexible integration .
168.7032	The UK Labour members of the PES Group welcome the adoption of their contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation , without endorsing every single detail .
168.3019	These islands must be able to feel that they are an active part of the European Union , and I hope that the Union will turn them into a paradise both for tourists and for their inhabitants .
92.5964	In the Middle Ages , those regions and their people did not belong to Europe , and even today , they are not really considered to be European .
209.4314	The special characteristics of these regions derive in general from their island status and their distance from continental Europe , but also from their chronic dependence on only a few products or even a single product , and thus require specific measures designed to overcome these constraints .
420.9573	Mr President , I apologise to the Presidency and to the interpreters , who have to listen to this last explanation of vote and , in particular , I sympathise with the translators of our explanations of votes , particularly , in my case , the Italian translator , Ornella Buson .
99.5008	In fact it becomes clear that the purpose of the agency is to take over national defence powers , or to paralyse them , and to put them at the service of the Commission 's objectives .
132.9938	That does not prevent the Commission and Parliament from christening the agency a `` European Authority '' , a title totally contrary to the philosophy that supposedly inspires it .
433.0750	That is not at all what the Bowis report is proposing ; it gives the impression that basically it regards food safety as another pretext for fuelling the well-known process of strengthening the Commission 's powers at the expense of the national authorities and public safety .
378.8230	So I think it appropriate for me to make a statement condemning these unspeakable acts on behalf of the European Parliament , which has always advocated respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities .
427.4304	Madam President , I understand the rapporteur 's objections , but the vote on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will not only be about money but also about a particular political line .
443.1600	I should like to ask you also to support our making the necessary adjustments to budget line A-206 , Acquisition of immovable property , depending on which amendments are adopted , so that we do not exceed our self-imposed ceiling of 20 % of total administrative expenditure .
21.9427	Before the vote on Amendment No 929
27.2895	Section VI , Economic and Social Committee
5335.4701	Report -LRB- A5-0276 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Nicholson , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea -LRB- ICES Division VIIa -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000/0071 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RSB-
19.1503	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
194.7843	The export subsidies mean that the EU ' s food surplus is dumped on the world market at low prices , as a result of which the food industry in many developing countries , for example , suffers serious competitive disadvantages .
32.3501	To obtain sufficient economic funds for increased aid to the Balkans , the Member States must reallocate funds from the available budget .
1317.0639	Nonetheless , Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important priorities - especially , increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty , a number of important environmental and equality issues , etc . We have voted against the right ' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women 's Lobby .
215.1822	- -LRB- SV -RRB- Where travel expense refunds for Members of the European Parliament are concerned , we maintain our view that refunds must be made only for actual costs incurred for travel on official business .
326.8881	I am assuming - and I hope that the Commission will contribute appropriate constructive solutions - that we will have a transitional arrangement to fill the three years between 2002 and 2005 .
3400.3474	It is with the purpose of effectively muzzling the national parliaments , above all , that the European Commission , in its frenzy of regulation and liberalisation , has tabled a proposal for a directly binding regulation rather than a directive , which is to be whipped through Parliament and the Council of Ministers with all hands on deck so that it can enter into force as early as 31 December of this year .
13.9833	We therefore support the Commission ' s efforts at reform and oppose further preferential treatment of this sector .
8.7457	That made them heavily dependent on loans .
25.1682	Nicholson Report -LRB- A-0276 / 2000 -RRB-
0.2462	It is important to ensure that aid funds are not used for military purposes .
77.9392	We stand by the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be paid for by the real polluters -LRB- i.e. large-scale industry -RRB- out of their excess profits .
44.3215	Moreira Da Silva Report -LRB- A5-0271 / 2000 -RRB-
92.7595	This money should be spent by bringing into line and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all the 15 Member States of the European Union .
0.2409	Out of precautionary considerations , it is useful to be clear about these substances .
9.9849	That concludes voting time .
1.6556	This is to replace the national format which is already widely in use .
5.8269	The loss of data for balance of payment reporting statistics brought about by this change is minimal .
11.6938	You have to bear in mind that small and medium-sized businesses are of course the ones primarily affected by this .
0.3983	For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised .
87.2817	I believe that this report is of central importance if we are truly to succeed in integrating the public and small and medium-sized businesses into the euro area and for increasing public acceptance of economic and monetary union .
11.4762	In the free movement of capital involving the single currency , there should not be any restrictions or huge discrepancies .
4.7130	Yet the European Parliament and the Commission genuinely attach vast significance to it .
12.6310	I endorse the dual-track policy , by means of which the rapporteur hopes to spur the slow banks into action .
5954.0048	We can not force banks to engage in unprofitable business , but , as politicians , what we can do is support the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , which calls for measures to be implemented before the end of next year , and , preferably , for these standards to be in place when the euro coins and notes come into circulation .
314.4286	The proposal by Mrs Peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table , not to lay down the law , but because we simply can not increase the pressure any further from the political side .
97.8555	After all , if the systems for making cross-border payments remain as expensive as they are today , the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be called into question .
435.0431	We are of the opinion that this form of collecting statistical data on the Union ' s internal credit transfers is a vestige of the past which can no longer be justified in an integrated , unified area and which forms an obstruction to the proper running of the market .
475.2918	Listening to what some Members had to say in committee , Members who have been in this House longer than I have , gave me the feeling that this multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship exercise that Parliament is going through for the fourth time belongs in that category .
3.0796	Ladies and gentlemen , thank you in advance for supporting my report .
42.2299	But if assistance is withdrawn at European level then the regions need once again to be given increased opportunities to act .
63.1620	SMEs are the major source of job creation , in terms of both quality and quantity , and they play a crucial role in social cohesion and regional planning .
60.2650	She has studied the proposals with great care , and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned . That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme .
12.8881	Thirdly , we must look for European added value .
66.7531	It follows from this that small and medium-sized businesses only thrive if unemployment is low and if public budgets at all levels are free of debt and have sufficient resources to commit to the investment budget .
11.8238	Enterprises need clarity .
601.0818	Above all , when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project , it should not need to provide 120 % loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing ; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea .
208.9286	The national governments , and even the regional and local authorities , already act as gigantic finance pumps to siphon off taxpayers ' money , that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population including the most disadvantaged , and pour this into big business and thence to proprietors and shareholders .
20.6265	The nursery for small and medium-sized businesses contains several thousand experiments which feed large enterprises with manpower and ideas .
101.7266	What I want the Commissioner to address above all in the range of measures that we have proposed here is making access to support and information easy and quick so that people running these businesses will be able to use the information effectively .
2.8003	They will all have a place of honour in the multiannual programme .
6.7442	Finally , I welcome the idea that we should review the implementation of the programme annually .
194.7268	There is an urgent need , following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara , to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania .
88.7080	A considerable number of Albanians are leaving their homeland because of the instability in their country , because of the social difficulties and because of the pre-modern structures of society and family .
104.2902	We need preventative measures specially tailored to Albania , which will provide support for building or rebuilding the country so as to enable people to live in dignity in the region .
463.1873	Thus it is that documents have been circulating from one body to the next , and the European Commission , for example , refuses to make public the report concerning inter alia even the Customs Assistance Mission -LRB- CAM -RRB- established in Albania .
5.8001	Let us try to see the truth with open eyes .
5.2521	Mrs Karamanou , congratulations on the extensive , wide-angled approach in your report .
8.9588	It is a very important issue which is being shaped by historical , social , political and economic factors .
7.3274	We will never know the true death toll .
0.4390	People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another .
228.0022	However , what I can not accept in this report , and I will state this quite frankly , is that it confuses cause and effect , which is to say it confuses a procedure for the carefully considered issuing of visas , and hence the possibility of migration , with a cause , that of illegal immigration .
46.2795	The enormous institutional changes that came out of the Treaty of Amsterdam have had an impact on the way asylum and migration are dealt with .
3.4734	Thirdly and lastly , the action plan and its way of implementation must be observed regionally .
9.0971	But of course , this request is also directed at ourselves to be sparing with European regulation .
8.1310	It is particularly important for this strength of acting at Community level to be emphasised at this time .
94.3458	I am also in favour of making codified proposals with regard to amendments to existing EC legislation , so that the amendments can be integrated into the existing directives or regulations .
186.2344	The principle of subsidiarity , properly understood , points us in both directions : take decisions at the lowest level possible , but acknowledge that the lowest level possible may be indeed a very high level , when general goods are at stake that will be lost unless protected on the same terms everywhere .
11.7996	The report is a model of concise and clear drafting and I hope colleagues will take that very seriously indeed .
51.9906	The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did not gain much enthusiasm from its Members .
439.2090	I referred to this in the report on the SLIM project , because Community legislation - and Mr Medina has just proved it by reading out one of the articles of the Treaty - is difficult to understand , even for the experts .
138.9535	I am therefore not very enthusiastic about certain aspects of the report , because I would have liked the report to have been more ` communitising ' as regards the internal market , and on this point , especially , these are clearly not the prevailing winds in the report .
55.6297	What is important for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to improving the quality of legislation , especially with regard to subsidiarity .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
16.7106	This continuing state of affairs could have an adverse effect on the public 's attitude towards the euro and its acceptance of it .
203.4892	Mr President , we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
594.7764	So , as chair of the Committee on Fisheries , I would like to use our oral question and this debate to talk to both sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides - about a few issues , and I would like to do so very calmly .
11.9292	This is what the people of the European Union , whom we represent here , are demanding .
14.3753	A great deal of water has flowed under the bridge since , and yet the agreement has expired and not been replaced .
1.5316	I can understand the Commissioner ' s reasons , but not those of the Director-General .
67.7963	We could say that , eleven months after the docking , we are still paying for the previous agreement and the one before that .
647.5991	Mr President , we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations even get under way shows how difficult it is becoming to find fish stocks for our massive EU fleets to exploit .
12.1273	With the second agreement , things were very clear .
0.2550	But we must also understand that nothing lasts forever , not even fish stocks .
208.1158	I am therefore particularly keen to make it clear that if there is anything that sets the PPE-DE Group apart , it is not only in supporting , defending and fostering fisheries agreements , but also in firmly promoting their extension .
299.5039	Thirdly , since the fisheries agreement came to an end , Community and non-Community fleets that are not subject to the control of either the Commission or the Member States have continued to exploit the Saharan fishing grounds , in particular a substantial Dutch fleet .
63.6527	I can well understand why , because this type of fishing was a source of revenue and employment for what is by European standards a poor region .
1258.0774	Another aspect that I wish to highlight is the fact that at the end of this month , temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year of inactivity comes to an end . This situation is unsustainable , since they would all rather work than receive aid .
1024.3737	This Andalusian MEP has been negotiating and proposing initiatives for a year in corridors , in offices , in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner so that the highly specific idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet working in Morocco would be taken into account .
262.5891	Spain has done a magnificent job in turning round the difficult neighbourly relations which Europe and North Africa and Spain and Morocco have suffered during the course of history .
877.1671	As a Spanish and Andalusian MEP , I assert the rights of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend their jobs , which have been endangered for almost a year , and for us also to defend these jobs here in Parliament .
14.8514	We shall now proceed to the vote .
357.2602	An almost 12-year old story full of false hopes , stalling tactics , hopes and personal need , about placatory measures for those involved and tough defence of old rights against citizens seeking no more than their due .
69.2555	As you know , the issue is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities .
292.2675	If the Italian legal system is reformed and modified , as it was in respect of academic teaching staff , we do not think that the Commission can intervene given that every European citizen has equal access to all categories of professions .
41.2260	The injustice is about two people doing the same job , working side by side , but on different pay and under different conditions .
59.5800	Worst of all , I believe , is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives .
4635.3989	I remind the Commission that I hope it will reply to the point that in the AlluÃ © case the ruling of the Court is as follows : ` Hereby rules , it is contrary to Article 48 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the EEC Treaty for the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants in any event to one year , with the possibility of renewal where in principle no such limit exists with regard to other teachers . '
149.8921	Well , I believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with European law , particularly the freedom of movement , and no exceptions can be made to these principles .
47.9343	There are still many fetters and many obstacles to this internal market , as today 's debate has shown , and not just in this case .
14.8514	We shall now proceed to the vote .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
1329.2183	On behalf of this Parliament , I immediately sent to the President of Austria , Mr Thomas Klestil , and to the Chancellor , Mr Wolfgang SchÃ 1/4 ssel , messages of condolence and support in the ordeal that a tragedy of this kind is for the victims , those close to them and the people of Austria as a whole .
9.7052	Are there any comments ?
67.2268	I support Mr Ceyhun ' s proposal , and I would be very grateful if the Council could clarify whether it really intends to put forward a new proposal with regard to this issue .
101.7854	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , our group regards this incident as being so important that we do not consider it appropriate for it to be dealt with in the topical and urgent debate .
39.0555	I have the impression that you agree with their rationale , Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo , if I understand you correctly .
9.8974	Madam President , some time ago in this House we discussed the issue of sanctions on Iraq .
87.1833	It is urgent that before the proposed change by the British authorities is implemented we have a debate and the Commission indicates quite clearly where the law lies in this regard .
12801.0836	-LRB- A5-0314 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Roure , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters , in particular in the area of combating organised crime , laundering of the proceeds from crime and financial crime -LSB- 10213/2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000/0815 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RSB- .
9.9746	Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace , freeze , seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime .
67.6061	The creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice can not remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments .
57.5200	Furthermore , Article 8 of the draft Convention limits the reasons which Member States may invoke for refusing to provide assistance to `` essential interests '' .
163.1250	Allow me to start by congratulating Mr Marinho on his work and to say that , although we need to support efforts to combat financial crime , we also need to be careful .
32.4353	Of course , we must identify , prosecute and sentence people who launder dirty money on behalf of terrorists , arms dealers and drug traffickers .
9.6273	Our task is to detect , trace , freeze , seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime .
45.7237	These things are in the amendments and , judging by the debate in the committee , I am very hopeful that Parliament will vote for them .
475.8767	It seems to me that this set of initiatives is going forward in a way which risks setting at naught the protection provided by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
1.5496	In reality , however , it is not all as simple as that .
275.3534	Lastly , Mr President , the Group of the European People ' s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on lawyers ' activities .
13.5556	The second measure , the second instrument , is harmonisation .
6.6827	This is a Portuguese initiative that has already been commended by a number of previous speakers .
26.0733	This was also the subject of the joint Justice and Internal Affairs/Ecofin Council meeting held on 17 October .
130.2477	The best way of strengthening Parliamentary control of Europol is to fully integrate the Europol Convention into the European Union ' s ' judicial framework .
151.6716	A step in the right direction , for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now , is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation .
1.7538	This is the sense of the guarantees : to push forward this aspect of freedoms .
97.1169	The European Parliament is the supranational Community body that can determine this relationship , and I therefore propose that you support its validity by showing support for our rapporteur .
216.9524	Only when the institutional model and the rules governing the European area of justice are clearly defined will it be possible for citizens and Parliament to express their opinions on the individual measures proposed by the Council .
74.7440	By strengthening the fight against serious organised crime , Eurojust is therefore a logical step in the efforts to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom , security and justice .
283.2647	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Gebhardt deserves our congratulations on the excellent report she has presented , dealing with one of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council .
282.9983	However , since with Eurojust we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges in order to combat all forms of serious crime - and on this point I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur - this concept is being enlarged : we are no longer talking solely about cooperation on purely transnational crimes , but also about cooperating to counteract criminal activities .
275.7141	We will have the opportunity to make our commitment to this provisional unit from 1 January 2001 , but the Commission wants to sustain the debate on the form that the definitive Eurojust unit will take .
8.0310	All sides gave their honest opinions - in my view - without falling back on inflexible opposing positions .
48.4841	The problems that arose in spending were not of too much concern to the Fisheries Committee ; other areas were of greater concern .
26.0580	That we do not have clear targets , that we can not measure output , is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution .
43.2289	My second point concerns the hierarchy of staff with powers of authorisation . Here , Commissioner , overlaps which are actually unacceptable have occurred .
3.4228	My point is that it has played a beneficial role in addressing a number of issues .
7.9232	It is clear that this consortium approach does not establish a duality in terms of joint financial responsibility .
160.9249	We have therefore worked very hard to recover the 3.4 million euros , and one could say that we are over 90 % of the way there .
9.7052	Are there any comments ?
130.9177	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , after nine months ' work and a long struggle for consensus , we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
1489.1257	I hope that , even though it can only say yes to this Charter of Fundamental Rights , Parliament will clearly apprise the Council of its demand for this Charter to be made legally binding over coming weeks , so that it can open the way to the European Court of Justice for the citizens of Europe .
772.2590	As you know , this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter , and I can only urge you , therefore , on behalf of the Council , to follow suit , perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so .
12.5896	I am convinced , however , that the Charter will make its mark most especially by the strength of its content .
599.9523	The European Trade Union Confederation , for its part , saw fit to complain about what it considers to be some omissions , such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income , for example .
1199.5845	The fact remains that several individuals , Members of the European Parliament in particular , have suggested that explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union , which already refers to the European Convention on Human Rights .
0.4185	With the exception of the British delegation , our group unanimously supports the Charter .
666.0690	We in the European People 's Party are jointly and firmly committed to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaties as quickly as possible so that it can become a Charter of direct and unassailable rights for the people of the European Union .
387.4769	They have shown that European issues can be worked with in a new and exemplary way , a way superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference because of its open and democratic method of working , involving full public control and opportunities for citizens to participate .
29.5017	The right to health , social security , accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature , or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion .
35.9693	Fourthly , because the Charter - and this is particularly important for me - is based on indivisible civil and political human rights and fundamental social rights .
741.7872	Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe this Charter is nothing more than the umpteenth example of the ability of the European Union and its Member States to proliferate empty texts and declarations of intent .
3.5593	The Commission ' s representative at the Turin Convention attaches judicial significance to the document .
257.1548	Now that we have had the single market , it is now time for a Europe of rights The concept of citizenship within the European Union is a relatively new one .
4.9250	The Charter has actually been drawn up as if it were a text which might become binding .
161.7491	I am also very proud to see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country , Gunnar Jansson , played a very important role when this Charter was drawn up .
831.2611	As I said last night - I will say it again today - there are too many failings in that respect all across this Union and sometimes , in our eagerness to develop judicial and police cooperation , we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not made the passive victims , the collateral damage of a war against crime .
72.5918	Madam President , the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights has the same ambiguous foundation as the work of the body itself .
113.4357	For example , the Italian Constitution lays down the limits of public morality and the European Convention lays down the limit of the rights of others and public safety .
1617.3386	Mr President , today in the vote at 12 noon we will conclude a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union , which already contained the request for a declaration of rights , a process that we continued in 1989 with the De Gucht Resolution .
3.0851	The Charter is going to have effects , whether or not it is in the Treaty .
0.4108	That is to be welcomed , not feared as Mr Bonde seems to think .
127.0308	It appears that the century which is coming to a close , with all its battles to emancipate the under-privileged social classes , has been in vain and has taught us nothing .
138.5308	The Charter fills a gap in EC law and strengthens the individual ' s protection against infringements by European police , by authorities which combat fraud and by authorities which regulate competition .
16.4684	I do not understand how anyone can reject the Charter because it does not cover everything which they would like it to .
8.1743	Mr President , I can continue where Mr Gahrton left off .
11.7441	My third observation concerns the rights of citizens from third countries .
166.4487	The Council of Europe , along with the Court of Human Rights , has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision , and we can build on these .
1623.5144	As it stands , the Charter which we shall be voting for today - I hope by a large majority - , will clearly afford us better protection of our fundamental rights which is more in keeping with the times than acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights would have done .
5.6671	This is why we need to take further steps forward .
58.3564	I believe it is important to keep this in mind if we are to obtain the necessary backing for the Charter from Europe ' s citizens .
2140.6119	Once adopted by this House , the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as a benchmark for my report and , as far as I can with my own personal and intellectual resources and those of the people assisting me , I shall carry out an evaluation , right by right and country by country , of the extent to which the Charter is respected in the fifteen countries of the European Union .
5691.5638	Mr President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , first of all the Commission would like to endorse the comments made by the President-in-Office , Mr Moscovici , and to welcome the key contribution made by the Members of the European Parliament to the debate and indeed to the Convention , particularly the role played by Mr MÃ © ndez de Vigo in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
1.5196	I shall refer only to some of the salient points of this debate .
59.5900	The Convention chose to include fundamental rights inspired by various texts of the Council of Europe , the Treaties and Member State constitutions .
5.9279	The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
270.0473	As matters stand , it is also up to the European Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are , today , at least three conditions for accession which Turkey must meet .
9.3054	Besides , conditions could not have been imposed exclusively by a decision of the European Parliament .
124.6042	That is why I took careful note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon regarding the preconditions for Turkey ' s accession , which are certainly worth looking into .
3366.3903	I am delighted to be able to report that the Turkish Government has since acknowledged this accession partnership as the basis for further cooperation , giving us good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve , i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform in a bid to achieve membership of the European Union .
813.3299	The most important thing , as far as I am concerned , is that Helsinki triggered a debate in Turkey , a public debate on the conditions of Turkey 's accession to the EU , a debate which is supporting and bolstering the forces of reform in Turkey .
1.3814	This text has been submitted for you to take a stand on it .
0.6662	The aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession .
66.1004	I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous . Nonetheless , I would urge Turkey to take this issue seriously , whatever the outcome of the vote .
183.6561	The European Parliament will play its part in fostering relations with political parties , the NGOs and the press , as well as developing its tricky and sometimes fraught relationship with the Grand National Assembly .
6.4636	Mr Morillon , in my view , your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report .
74.9861	When you visited Turkey in March , you at least referred to the Kurdish problem by name , as you did here today .
133.6719	The suggestion that the Europeans are going to bring about , I quote , `` a radical change in habits and outlook '' in the Turks is both extremely naive and extremely self-important .
4.3474	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report troubles me .
1740.8149	Recommendation -LRB- A5-0325 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union -LRB- 4487/1/00 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000/2233 -LRB- AVC -RRB- -RRB-
209.3590	However , when we come to discuss the power of information in the future , we must realise that more widespread control , and the consequent provision of a greater guarantee for the human person , is a necessity .
31.5071	Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation -LRB- A5-0325 / 2000 -RRB-
8.0985	For example , we note that :
50.4053	The rights contained in the Charter are already included in national constitutions and safeguarded by national parliaments close to the nations of Europe and their cultures .
193.3104	Article 19 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , for example , states that `` Collective expulsions are prohibited '' but does not specify that this ban may be suspended in the event of war or serious internal public order disturbances .
5.8012	We shall offer a brief explanation of these three objections in order .
13.8345	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny .
212.2982	Let me reiterate today , however , that we all have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have entered this phase , which is so crucial for Europe .
4.7266	A society which recognises only rights and not duties becomes selfish .
21.3094	This is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions .
1314.3386	While the Convention method is a valuable one , and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise , all the same nothing can justify depriving the European Parliament , the physical representatives of the peoples of Europe , of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text .
35.3789	The Charter must be improved , and the European Parliament must propose a strategy enabling it to be updated and enriched .
65.6969	It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice ; on the contrary , the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter .
56.2828	Fortunately the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the sensible path to take , which is to see the Charter as having power that is merely political rather than binding .
524.8288	Established as `` a body '' by the Cologne Summit , it declared itself a `` Convention '' , a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the French Revolution degenerated into the Reign of Terror under another `` Convention '' .
195.1406	The method used , the cuts made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of the text , on the other hand , shed a harsh light on the new totalitarian agitators at work at the very heart of the process of European integration .
316.0985	Fortunately , in this field , the European Parliament still has only a consultative role until the Treaty of Amsterdam is fully implemented , yet it is still finding occasion to abuse this role by putting the brake on reasonable decisions .
1.5471	However , there are differing interpretations as to how this can be achieved .
67.7292	That was the case a century ago , and although there was a crack down , it is now back in full force .
17.8189	The last thing we want is that the single market allows criminals to enter the single market unseen by the back door .
106.4871	We also support the future establishment of a convention to help combat organised crime and money laundering , and the various measures proposed in order to achieve those purposes .
83.5238	In fact , a provisional cooperation unit is being set up , composed of a representative of the judges or police officers with equivalent competence from each of our 15 Member States .
88.2673	Mr President , as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee , I take a close interest in Turkey 's accession prospects .
17.4258	Turkey ' s role in Cyprus is also unacceptable .
385.9182	However , we back the rapporteur ' s criticism that there is at present no effective assessment of the EIB ' s loan operations and that there are deficiencies when it comes to public scrutiny and democratic control of the Bank ' s activity .
11.7839	Turkey , for all its differences , always was and still is an integral part of Europe .
18.5068	Turkey ' s accession to the European Union is an issue that has become even more topical .
197.8566	Mr Morillon says that Turkey should try not to perceive the European Union as an exclusive Christian club which wants to keep it , Turkey , out .
257.3413	Turkey will become an essentially democratic country once it learns to live with its past , just as democratic Germany has learned to live with its past - we asked the same of it .
647.5159	Once the Ankara Government has understood that the status quo is not acceptable to Europe or to the rest of the world , then considerable progress may be made : the island may be reunified , and a fair and lasting global settlement may be achieved tomorrow in compliance with international law .
10.4568	Why is none of this included in the European Commission 's report ?
83.4525	It is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey .
576.4998	If you deal with the Armenian question in connection with the EU report - please read my lips : the Armenian question in connection with accession to the EU , then the project which we have discussed today will simply never get off the ground .
779.2963	It is , moreover , the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process , in order to be in a position , in Marseilles , to establish the necessary guidelines .
25.3182	Yet , we have managed to maintain dialogue even on occasionally sensitive subjects : stability , terrorism , emigration and human rights , for example .
119.4526	The fact remains that the Council , particularly since 1995 , has striven to allocate more extensive resources to the Mediterranean region , appropriate to the challenges of the partnership .
9.7678	This is a hugely important issue and I say that as someone who comes from central Europe .
188.8303	Mr President , there is as you know a saying in English that when the star does not appear in a show it is rather like a performance of Hamlet without the first grave digger .
152.5823	We want to see the bringing together of policies on single market issues and agreement to introduce cumulation of origin side-by-side with the sub-regional free trade arrangements for all partners entering into free trade with each other and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin .
13.6767	We welcome with great satisfaction the news that the Commission intends to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process .
59.8020	I have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the Process , and the enhancement of the Barcelona political agenda must be added to all this .
1241.8734	Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently , according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union .
150.6138	These are the important practical questions I wished to ask , and I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing us to have this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission are due to discuss these issues .
47.5597	The world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and , as a result , is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition .
325.9093	It is disappointing to see that the Mediterranean countries only called up just under a quarter of the EUR 4.7 billion budget of the MEDA I programme which expired in 1999 .
435.2451	In this respect , the proposal that the Commission has made for a new impetus is a positive one , and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten has set out in his speeches and repeated here this afternoon .
182.3920	It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area , which historically and culturally has enriched our European continent .
147.5475	What is much more serious , however , at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view , often very divergent ones , within this Chamber , more and more Palestinians are being killed .
12.4038	Aid for reconstruction
128.9914	However , if , when it comes to December , we do not include the funds required to implement the regulation then all we are doing today is building castles in the air .
66.6647	The procedures involved are often too complex , but we must not turn a blind eye , nor must we want to - and I hope the Member States do not do so either - to their part in this .
85.9678	The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through , so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies .
168.3772	But I am also happy because I feel that Parliament has succeeded , by keeping the pressure on , in turning round a situation that originally left a great deal to be desired .
1.9049	I repeat : unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really should be cut back .
10.4345	However , we ought not to focus on Kosovo alone .
7.2324	It is also unfortunate that a large number of programmes have been put in the so-called performance reserve .
85.9802	At Feira , the Council considered those countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process as potential applicants for membership of the European Union .
71.7940	I should like to remind you that the main priorities of the CARDS programme are the strengthening of institutions with regard to democracy and the rule of law , economic development and reconstruction , and regional cooperation .
6.4599	The European Union was right to react positively to President Kostunica 's accession to power .
26.1600	It was first examined on 6 November .
1253.2991	Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 , what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan ?
4.9292	How can we even consider reviving this partnership without first resolving the conflict ?
1092.2533	I can simply point out the fact that France and Germany - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - raised these questions during a bilateral summit in Vittel last week , where it was decided to form a working group in order to find a solution to the problem .
26.2093	At the same time , the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes , in particular its TACIS programme .
0.3007	The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points .
94.1874	I should also like to add that these two texts focus , in particular , on strengthening the framework of criminal law in order to fight organised rings of facilitators .
4315.1218	The report that was adopted by the Turkish cabinet on 21 September as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law , such as the inclusion of measures in the Civil Code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields , ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and , lastly , measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences .
2.0978	The Presidency-in-Office therefore has no answer to give with regard to this point .
129.7450	Next week , a meeting of the European Conference will take place on my invitation in France , in other words a meeting with the candidate countries .
1013.6006	Do you think that the Austrian model , i.e. bilateral majority resolutions , will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council ?
105.2776	The Council did not receive a copy of this letter but the Presidency has , of course , replied to Mr Cem and all of the Member States were informed about the content of the reply given .
1074.4630	And what is his opinion of Mr Cem 's position - the President-in-Office did not reply here - that there can be no link-up between the Cyprus question and furthering the Accession Partnership between Turkey and the European Union ?
635.8998	It must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement ; as he knows , if this agreement were not reached , bearing in mind its significance , this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco .
6.3940	I must therefore express my scepticism about the result .
683.6638	It is worth pointing out that the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions , in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council , must make it possible to reinforce cooperation between Member States while at the same time reinforcing the protection of human rights .
8.7127	Supplementary questions must come from other Members .
2655.2895	Furthermore , in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union ' s oil supply , the Commission indicated that , at the European Council of GÃ ¶ teborg , it was planning to present a plan to save energy and to promote the diversification of energy sources , which should help to boost energy efficiency , especially in buildings and transport .
1722.7778	In the same vein , at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo as part of the Third Commission of the General Assembly of the United Nations which met on 9 November 2000 , we launched an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with international organisations defending human rights .
24.0986	It is therefore up to NATO to take the steps it deems necessary to prevent further accidents of this kind .
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. -RRB-
17.6050	It is the prerogative of those handing out money to stipulate the political objectives and the Commissioner has done so on several occasions .
3.5685	His symbolic presence here could open up prospects for the overall policy which we are pursuing .
7.2084	If we treat the area as a region of political antagonism we shall be making a big mistake .
76.8465	Parliament must be regularly consulted and updated on progress , and it is this , the second of the rapporteurs ' requests , which we must all support .
11.5639	The heads of government have also confirmed the Union 's determination to back this process with technical and economic assistance .
12.2658	It was Parliament which supported the Commission 's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction .
36.2819	We do not think , as the House knows , that it is necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation .
25.7983	The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
61.6127	Leaders agreed to an expanded and updated Asia-Europe cooperation framework 2000 which forms the work programme for the coming decade .
2479.9516	I think that reminded us in Europe of the important role that we have in Asia , not just in economic and trade terms , though it has to be said that one of the reasons for Asia 's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years .
3.2711	I think it was an excellent political declaration but we still have a few problems here .
20.8178	We know that the Commission values ASEM extremely highly and it has our wholehearted support on that score .
53.0504	The existing machinery for transposing rules into Community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current sluggishness .
103.4002	It should thus promote the setting-up of new regional organisations , beginning where the Community already has a presence , such as in the western Pacific and south Pacific .
8.6435	It will truly make for sustainable fisheries .
1971.5104	I believe the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations , and the Commission must make every possible effort , Commissioner , to this end . To support the United Nations position in both the 1982 Convention and the New York one , which has been mentioned here , we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing .
370.1501	That is why I believe there is a tremendous role for the Commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to .
27.2663	The Commission is also required to carry out a huge amount of work in connection with negotiations held within the framework of regional fisheries organisations .
3.5650	Mr President , I have Mr Nicholson 's problem in an even more acute form .
52.3448	Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
84.6156	We have sometimes even wondered to what extent the cyclical market crisis itself may not be caused by the speculative action of these business structures , which thus gradually take control of the sector for their own interests .
881.8052	The extra EU subsidy proposed in Mr Garot ' s report would , in my view , be quite unreasonable in a year such as this when , with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe , we are to reform agricultural policy .
82.9255	I really do think that what the rapporteur has done here is a brilliant achievement ; it shows just what you can do with administration when you set your sights on a specific objective and the objective is clearly specified here .
141.5022	On the one hand , the largest producers , or those integrated with processing industries downstream , would distance themselves from this measure , preferring the systems they already have : individual savings ; bank loans and redistribution funds .
284.2557	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin straight away by saying that , in principle , I welcome the Commission 's proposal to set up a compensation fund , even from the point of view of Austrian agriculture .
5.4055	I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
30.2732	I fully understand why people want market organisation for intensive livestock farming , and why they should want to scrap agricultural policy for land-based production .
130.8165	We have a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and we should not make the mistake of questioning the present common organisation of the market in pigmeat which , basically , works .
105.0386	The Commission feels that it is only fair to subject farmers who participate in the fund to some sort of discipline , because they receive a certain income guarantee in return , whereas others , who do not participate , have no such guarantee .
22.1162	-LRB- The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m. -RRB-
43.6551	The value added tax-based resources represent 36 % and the traditional own resources are 15 % of the total .
160.6682	Another element of the reform that corresponds closely to a key priority identified by the Court is the increased focus to be placed on results and performance measurement within a framework of resource allocation that is consistent with predetermined priorities and objectives that are clearly defined and measurable .
212.0045	That is to be welcomed and I would like to thank you most sincerely , Mr Karlsson , and also the Members of the Court of Auditors and its officials , for supporting the reform of the Commission in your report .
107.6820	Mr President of the Court of Auditors , I for one warmly welcome the fact that you have announced your intention to prepare a special report , to carry out a special audit on this .
0.4324	The reality as described in the annual report is , however , more sobering .
5.3001	The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given .
4.6872	The amount of fixed assets has been set EUR 240 million too low .
187.5115	I should also have liked the Court of Auditors ' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations , for example one or two per chapter .
4.9189	In 1995 , a convention to protect the EU ' s economic interests was adopted .
79.6904	The Commission and the Member States should see it in this light and use the findings of this report as a tool for improving their performance in managing the EU 's finances .
104.8346	I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to embark on in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance when it comes to Community spending .
73.2279	Right now , Madam President , I should like to stop talking and wait for someone from the Council to come here .
13.1667	The Court , as in other years , has failed to point out exactly where those failures occurred .
426.8539	Madam President , the enlargement of the European Union is looming , and the report by the Court of Auditors leaves us in no doubt that there is still a great deal of work to be done in the candidate countries too .
754.9257	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors under which we would be able to obtain advance information from the Court 's annual report on a totally confidential basis , and we also agreed that we would be discreet about this .
90.2235	I would also like to pick on the Council by asking why it is not moving forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation .
91.5807	Perhaps some European Union common sense will help sort out the problem and give George Bush his rightful place in history - its dustbin !
2.9280	We are not looking for scapegoats , either in our institutions or in our Member States .
762.0025	First of all , on the procedure for presenting the annual report to Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee , I am happy to listen to the assurances from Members of Parliament that the situation this year is more satisfactory than before .
3.4200	But we will have a chance to go through all that .
10.6957	When it is relevant , from the audit point of view , we mention everything that has to be mentioned .
83.7845	Ladies and gentlemen , as I am sure you will have noticed , the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors was marred by an unfortunate bug that intruded between his speech and this Chamber .
897.9608	Some amendments , such as Nos 1 and 18 , deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom , and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom , whether socialist , popular or green , have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment .
29.0697	Mr President , in March this year we adopted the directive on cableway installations designed to carry persons .
12.8220	We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer 's duties under product safety legislation .
9.9965	We have heard the justifications for them and for the reprise of the industrial arguments which we heard in committee .
20.0981	Provided the vendor can always inform the buyer of the nature of the goods and the limitations on the information that should be sufficient .
119.6842	Finally , a brief question for the Commission about Article 4 , which concerns European standards and the question as to whether they must be disclosed .
76.6641	I welcome the fact that exceptions have been made for shops associated with charitable institutions and non-profit organisations , as well as for articles sold as second-hand goods at markets or car boot sales .
62.6729	The reliability of product safety and after-sale care represent added value for a `` made in Europe '' label at a particularly difficult and crucial time .
1441.9613	Elsewhere , we are calling on the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services , so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now , instead of waiting for the Commission 's proposal , since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on .
3.2409	I would only say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal .
311.8373	We now also provide for the possibility of opening the system to third countries , in particular to the candidate countries : simplification of procedures for emergency measures at Community level so that we can take rapid action following the advice of a regulatory committee .
7.0112	This new requirement does not imply any substantial additional responsibility in the case of these kinds of shops .
109.2296	To replace the word `` producer '' with `` supplier '' , as proposed in Amendment No 11 , would create more confusion than clarity , as there is no definition of supplier in the directive .
26.2033	Although the Commission is in favour of quickly establishing a network , this has to be agreed between the Member States .
12.4594	Such certification can always be used for providing evidence but can not , in itself , be regarded as foolproof .
31464.6381	Having extensively explained why the Commission can not accept Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 28 to 30 , 32 , 33 , 36 to 43 and , in part , Amendment No 7 , the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34 , I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 20 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 31 and 35 and , in part , Amendment No 7 , the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34 , as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission 's proposal .
82.3988	Clearly , Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo feels that Italian Socialists may not be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
7.6349	I do not think they are incompatible .
62.5005	As far as the order is concerned , I leave it to the discretion of the President to decide , and I repeat that I am against all three amendments .
151.9426	The Mediterranean countries which do not belong to the Ã ... U have to cope with particularly acute problems of economic development and regional inequalities are becoming more and more marked .
1082.9520	With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants , in the spirit of a harmonised European migration policy , in addition to legal instruments guaranteeing the fair treatment of immigrants , financial aid instruments need to be established for all those young people who wish to return to their native countries to start work when they have finished secondary education or a university course in a European country .
62.2224	I should like to highlight one point which frankly I see as a determining factor in this question : the lack of equality in the employment sphere .
1323.2440	. -LRB- PT -RRB- Although somewhat belatedly , the Commission has presented its programme for the Community framework strategy on gender equality -LRB- 2001Â 2005 -RRB- , which differs strikingly from previous programmes and , specifically , from the fourth action programme , which finishes at the end of this year .
446.0289	Nevertheless , I voted for the report because , on the one hand , various proposed improvements submitted by my group were taken on board , and also because the report calls for studies into the position of women in national labour markets and the inadequate access they have to social security systems , an area in which we need statistically relevant gender-specific data .
31.8378	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products , as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards .
47.4900	It is now , and the Labour amendments offer a guarantee that charity shops will be left untouched and will be exempt from the directive .
92.8031	Finally , Amendment No 15 gives the Commission free rein in determining the rules governing the languages used by the Agency , about which we are very concerned .
2699.5123	Simplifying the decision-making process , creating decentralised operational centres -LRB- and not just in Pristina , which has gained in importance now that it has broken away from Yugoslavia -RRB- and dealing with the twin structure between the Governing Board and the Commission may prove to be the right moves in a bid to deal with the huge bureaucratic shortcomings at the European Agency for Reconstruction .
8.7105	We are therefore voting against both the Commission ' s proposal and Parliament ' s report .
10.6980	I therefore believe that there is a justification for modifying the present Community schemes in this area .
34.1238	In addition , such funds give Member States the opportunity , in the form of co-financing , to grant capped state aid to a greater or lesser extent .
297.7615	- -LRB- EL -RRB- Despite its serious shortcomings , the Morillon report is clearly an improvement on the Commission proposal as far as the partnership between the European Union and Turkey is concerned .
9.1632	We voted against it .
45.1792	Following the example of the rapporteur , we are bound to admit that Turkey has progressed on certain levels and that there are positive signs .
78.6592	Parliament had already undertaken the road to recognition as early as 1987 , and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates Parliament ' s consistency in this area .
11.5887	The Union must be more proactive and treat enlargement to include Turkey as a vital geopolitical strategy .
13.3479	Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey .
5340.8302	For a number of years , as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada , I have been able to observe the operation of one of the regional organisations , NAFO -LRB- Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation -RRB- , whose members are the countries of that region , including Canada , as well as all the countries that use traditional fishing zones in the region , including France , Spain and some other European countries .
28.9556	It will only be content when its own gunboat fleet , flying `` ring of stars '' flags , is enforcing its fisheries policies .
290.8939	What is important therefore is not to satisfy the Commission ' s desire for domination by weakening the position of Europe , which would be in direct conflict with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity .
1.8464	Ultimately , after some tough negotiating , an outcome was achieved that is worth defending .
312.7544	The objective of this proposal , which aims to replace three directives relating to waste incineration , is to improve air , water and soil quality and human health by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to incineration and co-incineration , notably dioxins , furans and heavy metals .
150.2308	I also think , however , that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth .
7.7329	The proposal has improved during the debate .
144.7555	The introduction of much stricter nitrogen oxide limits for new co-incineration plants such as cement kilns is also a step forward which will be an incentive for reducing emissions even though the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques .
44.9413	Mr President , honourable Members , forgive me - especially Mr Blokland - for being a few minutes late .
25.2940	In conclusion , this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health .
442.0745	In its fight to combat discrimination and social exclusion , and in terms of the responsibilities of each individual , the European Parliament will take pride in giving a strong impetus to the establishment of a system which will allow the essential principle of solidarity to be practically implemented .
14828.5303	However , there are huge differences between one country and another and we have no detailed or comparable statistics to help us ascertain reliably what applies where , what works best , where the weaknesses lie etc. , which is precisely why my opinion , which was drafted on the instructions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , stresses the need , before any generally-applicable rules are introduced for supplementary health insurance , for the Commission to submit a Green Paper containing an analysis of all these separate issues , together with the relevant information .
2.9898	Hitherto , this has been somewhat taboo up to a certain point .
72.9317	The risk that the less healthy and the elderly may not necessarily be able to secure full private insurance cover because they represent too high a risk is quite unacceptable in terms of social development .
538.8719	The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur ' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection .
14.9288	I think it is completely wrong that it should be money which decides who goes to the front of the queue .
608.4843	The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ' new proposal is correct , suggesting as it does that there should first be a review of the situation in the form of a Green Paper and that only then should decisions be made about whether a directive or recommendation is needed .
9.1854	There is at present an on-going discussion in the Netherlands about structural changes to the system .
23.5701	On this basis , the Commission should take the initiative and create solid cornerstones by way of guidelines for the Member States ' health systems .
13.9654	So an absolute `` one size fits all '' solution for insurance is unlikely to be the answer .
2146.6958	I therefore believe we should lend our support to what Mr Rocard has put in his report - and we congratulate him on it - asking the Commission to provide a service , a Green Paper which will enable us to see the current insurance situation in the Member States and also to define the future .
0.2172	Both are based on a three-pillar model with state , company and private provision .
60.5062	The EU has already produced a piece of legislation on supplementary pensions in the form of a Green Paper , which has resulted in a draft directive .
88.3238	Mr President , I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate Mr Marinos for his committee 's opinion .
61.8841	This study can form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament proposing initiatives or measures .
118.0727	I am very pleased to be able to tell you that all the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets have been adopted .
133.0964	We support the various elements of the programme , such as a multidimensional approach to this phenomenon , measures on health , education , housing , cohesion and complementarity with other related policies and the involvement of both non-governmental organisations and the very people who are subject to social exclusion .
29.1311	This means we have to make the most of the growth phases of the cycle to bring the position back to balance or a surplus .
942.7294	In this respect may I just remind you that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to include in the assessment of the stability programmes from next year precisely this long-term aspect of public finances in connection with the ageing of the population .
367.8773	One of the positive characteristics of the Netherlands programme , as I have said before , is the special attention it gives to the impact of the ageing of the population on the exchequer over the coming years .
166.9198	For this reason , the budget result for the year 2000 in the case of Germany will give a surplus of one and a half per cent of GDP .
61.6906	If we add to that the fall in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar , we have had an obvious setback in terms of inflation .
179.3241	They are also moving towards making a public pay-as-you-go scheme compatible with private pre-funding schemes , and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds , which may obtain long-term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem .
8.0361	This is thus our third guiding principle : the precautionary principle .
75.1384	It should be recalled that a number of proposed regulations are under discussion , which will reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the raft of Community measures and shall thereby , I hope , restore consumer confidence .
4.3439	However , this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency .
199.2756	I was , frankly , disappointed that there was no acknowledgement in Prime Minister Jospin 's statement yesterday of the hugely positive role played by the Community in recent years .
45.5795	Clearly , explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE , not only in France but also in other Member States .
131.5837	The Commission 's Food and Veterinary Office already affords top priority to Member States ' controls in relation to protective measures against BSE .
221.2202	In relation to its safety , let me repeat that there is an extensive range of controls already in place to ensure that MBM does not pose a threat of transmission of BSE .
98.5665	Yes , difficult as it may be to believe , it took four years to agree a measure which I consider to be fundamental to public health protection .
7.3969	Mr President-in-Office , I specifically call on the Council to make known its opinion on the TSE regulation .
64.0390	In this situation , the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection is to place a complete ban on the use of animal meal as feed .
508.5684	On this subject , I want to point out that those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party have tabled an amendment I hope will be voted through .
252.4738	Policies must change this situation so that those who are really responsible for this crisis can be penalised and so that precise decisions can make it possible for a first step to be taken towards ending this tragic crisis .
8.5815	They therefore need to be reviewed .
855.1531	The labelling of beef that was agreed on , which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago , does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced , and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials .
3.4322	Public opinion must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I am talking about .
555.9545	Back then , Mr President-in-Office , you did virtually nothing , just as your colleagues have done virtually nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl , the AIDS epidemic or contaminated blood , and always for the same reason : so as not to panic public opinion .
13.2909	The French ban will create a massive increase in demand , yet supply of this commodity is limited .
34.5351	Consumers have lost confidence and , in order to contain this phenomenon , there must be systematic BSE tests on cattle and sheep .
75.4995	What is far more important , in the spirit of the Commission proposal , is to work towards ensuring that animal meal complies with the highest safety standards .
310.0614	As far as the rest is concerned , for once , I agree wholeheartedly with what the honourable lady members , Mrs Ainardi , Mrs Auroi and Mrs GrossetÃªte , said .
57.7759	Well then , Council and Commission , you have a fair amount of financial leeway on which to base your robust policy .
9.3576	We must tackle this .
94.5520	Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I am happy to hear within this Chamber that the CAP must be changed at all costs .
10.7279	We denounced this here in Parliament , when Jimmy Goldsmith was here .
7.2965	Man 's food must be safe to eat .
7.2220	I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step .
5.0443	But you are not helping them to achieve this !
16.8040	Therefore , I am amazed , under these circumstances , that it is still permissible for corpses to be used or processed .
6.1182	Recently , the Phillips inquiry into BSE has been published in the UK .
27.8133	I would suggest that the European Commission also use the precautionary principle in regard to beef from France .
16.2269	As there is still a lot of uncertainty , we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken .
0.1737	I have listened to all these proposals - I am not insensitive to them .
486.1856	If people from Member States come and tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully implemented then maybe we will have to think again , but it will not be because the scientists tell us it is necessary , but because there is a failure to comply with the law in the European Union .
3.1165	Not inviting us to participate is the best way to avoid having to listen to us .
464.8853	The Commission considers that readmission agreements have an important role to play in clarifying and coordinating these policies , and the first Community readmission agreements are currently being negotiated with Russia , Sri Lanka , Pakistan and Morocco .
24.1014	What proposals does the Commission have concerning this matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union ?
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
32.8437	The aim during this period has been to reduce government deficit in order to achieve a more flexible monetary policy , lower interest rates and greater growth .
242.9595	I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002 : the euro is already in our pockets ; we have it in coins of different guises , but we already have it in our pockets .
85.6158	The ozone thresholds pursuant to Directive 92/72 were not exceeded in the city of Athens , but it should be noted that no measurements were made in mid-summer .
751.4824	Subject : Government aid to the audiovisual sector During a seminar on the arts sector organised by the French Presidency , a representative of the Commission 's Directorate-General for Competition expressed the view that the legal requirements to invest imposed on the networks constituted government aid by virtue of the very fact that such investment was made compulsory by the legislative authority .
7.1899	It must be respected and protected ' .
502.7881	This is not self-evident as this new growth is very unfair and , as we have seen in the United States for some ten years now , may be accompanied by persistent insecure employment , exclusion , poverty and urban ghettoisation .
11.5910	The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition , which is also rather simplistic and unduly bland .
22.3450	In the harsh climate which then arises , there are more and more people who can not keep up and who are marginalised and excluded .
656.6301	Mr President , in this Chamber we never cease to sing the praises of the European Social Model , the social market economy , which many feel with pride compares very favourably with the primitive model of the United States of America .
12.2223	-LRB- Technical fault -RRB-
8.7412	This is an enormous figure .
7.0208	Moreover , all political levels must be involved .
235.1080	I support the need to gain more knowledge about the causes of poverty and I also support preventative action against exclusion resulting from mergers , industrial change , relocations , rural desertification , and urban ghettoisation , with innovative and tangible responses involving both sides of industry , local and national government and concerted action by the public .
34.6051	There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in combating social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and of the structural reforms .
19.2039	This is a legalistic problem because , according to the Treaty 's wording , the reference concerns only social exclusion and not poverty .
3.0251	I believe that these proposals constitute a pragmatic response to your request .
8.8000	However , the fact that we accept this strategy does not necessary mean that we accept all the detail .
43.0890	If we define a clear , binding framework for the Member States , then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements .
128.1431	Energy from renewable sources will not be a panacea that will solve this problem , but nobody doubts that it can contribute greatly to alleviating it and also to diversifying our sources of energy and reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons , which indeed would not be a bad thing .
10.8490	I am going to repeat three of our demands .
3.8338	Stipulating realistic target figures can only increase public confidence in the energy policy to be pursued .
14.7146	I believe that a strong policy on renewable energies is a symbol of the Europe of tomorrow .
49.0390	Finally , the European countries must demonstrate , via these agreements , that they will contribute to the realisation of the Kyoto objectives .
54.0964	It seems a pity to exclude any category which can contribute to the overall achievement of energy from waste - whether it is for small-scale projects or part of the overall calculation .
11.4492	The formation of peat by assimilation and the production of organic debris are the same as with other plant biomasses .
430.2084	I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off my own seashore there are already well advanced windmills in the sea , certainly a project that is going to be up-and-running within a short space of time , so I would like to invite him to come and see it when it does get-up-and-running .
286.2733	The controversy over ending the use of nuclear power , for example in Sweden and Germany , has shown that without any visible energy alternatives produced at a competitive price and which are environmentally friendly , the debate is surely lacking something .
7.1879	That is why Member States must have binding objectives .
34.0391	Hence , I am optimistic about the future potential for renewables provided the right incentives are put in place .
17.6211	I believe that it takes great courage to keep renewable energy in the spotlight in the way she has managed to do .
21.8977	A dramatic increase in the price of oil without doubt starkly highlights the problems relating to our dependence on energy from fossil fuels .
12.4916	Therefore , we can not accept Amendment No 28 .
105.2654	However , while doing so , the Commission is very conscious that the terms used should not prejudice its right of initiative and must not be incompatible with the single market for electricity .
86.4802	In the Commission for the Reconstruction of Tajikistan , which has 25 000 widows , only one of 26 participants was a woman .
175.6139	Despite the fact that only a limited number of women have been involved , studies show that women ' s participation in the UN ' s peacekeeping forces improves relations with the local population , as well as general morale .
652.3027	The Theorin report goes into a lot of detail and repetition , which we in the Group of the European People 's Party -LRB- Christian Democrats -RRB- and the European Democrats consider do not belong in an official document .
230.0000	Politically speaking , I would be more inclined to interpret the amendment in question , i.e. Amendment No 19 , as a tactical defeat or a tactical withdrawal than a compromise on the substance , and in truth that is unworthy of this women ' s issue .
9.2923	They were held prisoner .
6656.1921	Portugal , which only opened up its diplomatic service to women following the `` Revolution of April 1974 '' , has recently demonstrated with the case of East Timor and our ambassador to Indonesia , Ana Gomes , how the role of a woman and her sensitivity to the problems and sufferings of a people that fought unaided for its freedom for 25 years can be recognised by the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament .
25.4813	Remarkably few have done so up to now ; only two or three , so I am told .
55.8242	That is why this dimension needs to be taken into account when drawing up European Union policies in the future .
5.1821	Unfortunately terms are not defined and distinctions are not made .
8.0519	Please communicate our protest to the Council .
20.5419	They are people with different experiences and these experiences are essential to the way in which policy is applied , especially in conflict management .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
15.4074	Secondly , if it is our intention to regulate the sector , then naturally we need to investigate a number of aspects .
219.1394	I have discovered over the past few weeks that there is a great deal of interest , both within international trade union circles and within a number of national trade union organisations .
11.0962	Argument two : are you in favour of introducing pay for housewives ?
11.1808	All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions .
47.7050	In addition , as a result of this project , two or three families have often clubbed together to employ a domestic help .
604.0141	We were sitting in the first part-session in October when , at the time we were debating the situation in Yugoslavia , we learned of the courageous reaction of the Serbian people and , ladies and gentlemen , you well remember I am sure , we immediately called for international sanctions to be lifted .
83.1851	Thereby Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation within the framework of world history , and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development .
9.6666	There can not be any doubt that the issue of Kosovo 's status is a democratic issue .
507.2057	On the other hand , we would like to be given a chance to prove to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia on our own , by recognising the genuine principles of democracy .
65.3062	I feel bound to say that , while I listened to you , I was struck by your mastery of what must have been a difficult situation and also by your determination .
7.1135	That will be put in order in the next Minutes , Mr Watson .
47.1942	Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable and stimulates greater efficiency .
270.8248	I consider a fifth important amendment to be that relating to the annual report , which must relate specifically to the documents that must be kept secret , or which are kept secret at any rate .
87.5603	This is a vague area , and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force , and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments .
74.7108	The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy objects to the idea that documents relating to foreign affairs and security issues will automatically and collectively be excluded from public inspection .
178.9084	If we really want to make it easier for the citizens to exercise their rights in practice , we will need specially trained staff in these contact points , who can , so to speak , take the citizen who is seeking information by the hand and guide him through the complex labyrinth of the institutions .
12.1926	Registers are important if we are not to have a form of public access to documents that is insider access .
12.0285	It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness .
7.5943	Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work .
14.4936	Mr President , transparency and openness do not appear in a good light in the European Union .
94.3552	If it were to be the case then it is a miscalculation because this is about the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens .
82.6303	There is a multiplicity of documents nowadays , and we should like to ensure that there is a high degree of access to as many different types of document in as many different forms as is humanly possible .
556.5766	Mr President , the Commission ' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents .
7.2520	This provision must be deleted or at least supplemented by the obligation to weigh up the various interests .
196.0630	The usual method of international cooperation , with all the customs and ground rules of diplomacy including the rule that everything must take place behind closed doors , will not do in the modern form of cooperation the EU has developed into .
17.7340	We must not confuse this with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements .
26.3287	In my opinion , a step has been taken towards making it possible for citizens to avail themselves of their right to information and knowledge .
793.4355	However , he is not the only one I should like to thank , as my sincere thanks also go to Hanja Maij-Weggen , of the PPE-DE Group , who is the other rapporteur , thanks to the enhanced Hughes Procedure .
101.6641	Transparency must become a founding pillar of all the work of the European Union , but the right to access documents is still not enough in itself to establish transparency .
109.7892	That is why Parliament is calling for European security and defence policy to be embedded in the structures of the European Commission in future .
434.9054	When President Prodi addressed Parliament on 3 October , he referred to the institutional triangle and stated that , in a European system based on checks and balances , the efficient functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest .
7.1922	I must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is the precise definition of what documents are .
2201.3816	I would like to highlight that , at the right time , the Commission could accept practically all the amendments , such as Amendments Nos 9 , 18 , 21 in part , 23 , 25 , 26.1 , 28 -LRB- f -RRB- , 35 , 38 , 40.1 , 40.6 , 41.1 , 42 , 43.1 , 47 , 49 and 52 .
169.8678	Sometimes I would indeed like to vote for the Commission ' s proposals and that means that Members really do need a list of the amendments the Commission can in fact support and of the amendments it does not wish to support .
11.9591	Own funds of banks
14.1056	Lastly , and most controversially , the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation .
40.6928	These amendments replace various other proposals in the report that will probably be rejected in the vote and which will then be replaced by the new amendments arising from this consensus
2241.9116	Mr President , in the light of the excellent vote of support for this report and given the Commission 's response this morning , it is obvious - if you look at all the parts we have voted on - that under Rule 69 -LRB- 2 -RRB- we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution in order to allow us to enter into fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council .
1726.0014	Mr President , I apologise for saying that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats had also requested that the vote be postponed , but your coordinator in actual fact came to me and said that you also wished to postpone the issue until the November II part-session instead of taking the vote this evening .
56.6437	The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is because - as Mr Goebbels has said - it is a very important issue .
127.9411	I do not know how much roll-call votes cost , but no doubt it comes to hundreds of thousands of French francs , or Belgian francs , out of our budget .
29.7474	I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward .
21.1852	remove meat-and-bone meal from animal feedingstuffs , not just for cattle and sheep but also for pigs , poultry and fish ,
9.9163	That is unacceptable .
28.0982	These are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them .
3.4110	It is crucial that we go further and promote a change in the common agricultural policy .
21.2468	The ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for feedingstuffs is only the first step along this road .
5.4322	At the same time , we keenly regret that the amendments our group tabled were not adopted .
24.3358	I feel that it would be appropriate to reduce the working hours of the people who work in pollutant companies .
94.8266	I will conclude by emphasising once again that the widespread treatment of hazardous waste must not lead us to tolerate the production of such waste .
33.8629	If indeed , for example , pensions were less inadequate in terms of the standard of living they allow , there would be fewer poor people .
9.0356	The report proposes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to combat poverty .
87.2555	I unreservedly support the proposal to implement a second Luxembourg process to deal with social exclusion , containing guidelines and national action programmes .
0.2483	The report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established .
349.5437	In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion , the Commission is complying with the Council ' s call to present `` by June 2000 '' an `` initiative for cooperation in this field '' .
74.1867	Mr President , I abstained from the vote for one specific reason : in my opinion , this report has not made the environmental progress that I hoped and called for .
2.9168	I call for a similar system to be adopted in all the towns of Europe .
8.4179	Some of the European Parliament ' s proposals are unrealistic and I can not endorse them .
18.5739	Moreover , in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public .
61.8041	Environmentally-aware high-earners are free to make a voluntary contribution to cleaner forms of energy , within a liberalised market , whilst everyone else carries on in the same old way .
3.3467	The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
147.7851	The three reasons are as follows : firstly , because it promotes the process of the consolidation of democracy and the deepening of the demand for human rights to be respected , particularly in relation to indigenous populations .
1575.3301	Mr President , in this debate , we wish to express - as many previous speakers have done very effectively - this Parliament ' s solidarity with , and support for , the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting to continue to prioritise the European Union ' s external relations with the countries of Latin America .
383.1417	I do not share the reservations expressed by our honourable Member , the Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico , Mr Seguro , with regard to the issue of human rights .
274.7546	Finally , in the dialogue with the Central American authorities , the Commission is also reiterating the importance which must be attached to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate democratisation and development in the region .
981.3657	In order to hold on to power , he did not hesitate to exploit the bitter debate on Ivoirian nationality , sparking an explosion of xenophobia : hatred of others , of foreigners , whether from Burkina Faso or Mali , even though so many of them have lived and worked in the country for many years .
172.9448	Real democracy can not now be established in CÃ ´ te d'Ivoire unless an independent commission of inquiry is set up to look into the crimes committed and unless an official undertaking is given on respect for human rights and civil peace .
1938.1549	Some people believe democracy is only of relative importance when it comes to Africa , that democratic procedures are a complex matter , that we have to give it time , but I personally believe that there can be no compromise with democracy and the question that arises for CÃ ´ te d' Ivoire today is the same one that arises for Guinea , for example , where we now know that there are people in prison and that the system is not democratic .
40.4301	Let me finish by saying this : dictatorships come into being only because there are people who are destitute and who have no access to learning , no access to knowledge .
110.6795	It would not be illogical for the European Union to immediately demand new presidential elections , in which all candidates would be able to participate this time round .
3.5510	Very many parts of Africa comprise very many different ethnic and religious mixtures .
121.3042	These elections must enable the political parties that were excluded from the presidential election to be represented at national level and thereby compensate , though only partially , for the defects of that first election .
21.6972	on the situation in Burma
217.4777	They are conducting a major offensive against the Shan people and the Karen people and , as the UN rapporteur has said , there is no sign of any dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD .
23.1050	We therefore reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction .
441.7479	I hope that , by prioritising this issue as an urgency , this Parliament is giving a clear message to the Burmese people that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is worsening rather than improving and are determined to try and do something about it .
7.7155	It has taken a long time .
502.4928	There is a particular risk in Asia of dissociating economic and political reforms , of economic progress and economic liberalisation without political liberalisation or greater constitutional legality . I believe that without a constitutional state that is functioning properly , in the long-term Asia will lose out on trade , subsidies and investments .
73.7518	Mr President , I agree in many important respects with the previous speakers , because much of what is happening in Vietnam today is unacceptable .
246.1429	Now , however , Human Rights Watch , as Mr Swoboda mentioned , is saying that Vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights .
7.3049	These extremely secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of Vietnamese government policy .
275.2335	However , the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be found by means of dialogue between the military regime , the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities .
17.6058	There is also clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities for their own press to operate a system of self-censorship .
3.0702	The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolution :
43.5854	We also require the EU to give help and assistance , not just in the southwest but across all of the areas that have been affected .
6.2398	I ask you all to support our resolution .
8.2012	It is vital that the Union does not restrict itself to making one-off interventions after disasters have occurred .
11.8420	The Commission has taken two initiatives along these lines .
19.7080	Mr President , a purely linguistic error has occurred in introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution .
1.7456	Postponing the vote would mean postponing the task we entrust to the Commission .
19.1503	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
62.1111	The report takes as its starting point the observation that an ever greater proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by supplementary health insurance schemes .
1019.1869	I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission 's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive , while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes .
57.0078	At a time when the population is ageing dramatically , it is crucial that we look at improving the health care system for people across Europe .
8.4485	Obviously we can not accept that .
55.9949	Mr President , there is a strong case for fast track when it comes to implementing the results of the Basel review on bank capital adequacy .
1724.2335	As for the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the Commission ' s sense of the need for these measures by calling for a fast-track procedure for adopting them , we have to say that the rapporteur herself acknowledges that these new rules will have no effect on the anti-competition practices that are , alas , so widespread in the United States .
125.9017	Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks , as a result of higher own-funds requirements .
103.9282	Having made this initial comment , I should like to point out that I believe that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach adopted towards these regulations on capital , which help deal with the issues related to risk .
106.8560	These are a few initial thoughts on how we might succeed in devising a rapid legislative process which is controllable and efficient within the current Treaty regulations .
164.4389	The time has now come to acknowledge that the institution of the ` European Ombudsman ' is sufficiently grown up and has shown sufficient signs of maturity to have its own budget .
788.2606	The EPP/ED Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Ombudsman 's competences should be enlarged and the sooner the better , especially in the fields of the Ombudsman 's investigative powers laid down in Article 3 of the 1994 decision .
73.0568	An Ombudsman is naturally bound by secrecy provisions , but it is good for citizens to know that , as Ombudsman , he or she can obtain access to documents which they can not access themselves as citizens .
156.6260	Accordingly , the point of departure of this report was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to give applicants access to their own marked examination scripts during the selection procedure it organised .
91.9919	We believe that the institutions of the Community should conduct their staff recruitment procedures , and indeed all recruitment procedures , with a maximum of openness and transparency in order to avoid the suspicion of partiality , injustice and administrative incompetence .
21.2459	I am referring here to an amendment on the need to provide indisputable proof relating , for instance , to oral test procedures .
11.2347	My colleague , Mr BÃ ¶ sch , has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled .
49.9554	When I tabled two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition , I received clear , detailed replies .
1.6211	This is the beginning of opening up the process of government and making it transparent .
1.8651	Firstly , the corrections to the examinations set by the Commission are always made anonymously .
24.3855	Obviously , I was talking about July 2000 .
12.0529	VOTE
13.9109	-LRB- Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote -RRB-
35.4956	- -LRB- DE -RRB- In assessing the Directive on the own funds of banks , a number of conflicting interests have to be carefully weighed against each other .
104.6009	That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose .
57.6214	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur , and it is shared by the European People ' s Party .
148.1218	Social conditions in most Member States of the European Union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross-border cooperation between the various police forces .
24.3883	The majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college .
11.6016	Yet another interim but not so short-term decision , another little present to Parliament from the Council .
40.6052	The rapporteur wishes to see added crime prevention , provision of services , innovation and border surveillance and also wants internal security modified to include maintaining law and order .
8.4618	Those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for .
6.2404	I will welcome a levelling-out of standards in some Member States in the European Union .
3024.8509	From the first discussions on this dossier , which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament , the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture , grounded in the highest standards of duty , respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime .
4.8167	The Council wishes the Police College to develop primarily with an intergovernmental approach .
69.8402	For these reasons , the Members of the European Parliament from the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report .
29.6412	- -LRB- SV -RRB- I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College .
26.2150	Undoubtedly , many of our courts are very slow and ponderous , and there is great difficulty in getting them to act quickly on these issues .
138.1052	The regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the Brussels II Regulation , which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents .
29.5044	My mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago , and she still talks about it .
5483.2886	What I therefore wish to tell Parliament is that , in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted by the end of this year - the Commission proposes that the first and utmost priority should be given to extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and , consequently , of this regulation on rights of access , covering both the children of married couples and those of unmarried couples without discrimination .
15.4693	We now proceed to the vote .
126.8164	Sport these days - and this needs to be said - is closely bound up with other economic sectors , such as the audiovisual sector or the sector of the promotion and sale of sporting products , for example .
0.4275	What we need is an intelligent and flexible way of interpreting the present rules .
41.6208	In other words , to put it plainly , it is the consequence of an attack on democracy , however hard we try to avoid seeing it in this light .
44.1256	The Commission is therefore expecting to receive shortly a reply to its request for detailed information on the measures planned by the UK government .
278.8598	The proposal was put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a pre-budget statement made six months before the full budget statement made in the spring of 2001 .
62.5251	Again , I thought that what Mr Simpson said was extremely helpful in reassuring us about the probable intentions of the UK government .
570.1427	Not only is a lot of time lost and high costs incurred through congestion , but it is quite a major problem for the environment in particular , and I therefore believe that , if the British government is actually investing money in solving the problems , then we all have something to gain , particularly all European citizens .
578.8294	We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we face the highest petrol prices , the highest diesel prices of any country in Europe - GBP 1.20 a litre for diesel is paid in the United Kingdom .
9.4631	That concludes this item .
381.5506	The European Parliament has a duty to let them know that we stand with them , and so I propose , once again , that we observe a minute ' s silence to express our solidarity and deep feeling .
29.7140	Madam President , I totally support this proposal since I was one of those who asked for this item to be entered .
8.9299	We made some good progress .
44.5859	The EU will deepen its relations with all major groups and will also contact the new US administration as soon as possible .
1733.6635	Given the - surprise - glowing report by Mr Prescott on the deal which he had himself brokered , why was it that not only Madam Voynet but , I believe , and this is my last question to the Commissioner , most of the other environment ministers in Europe all rejected that ?
36.9161	The fear is that the momentum has been lost and the American negotiators will change and we start afresh in May .
3.0321	The forests proved to be the major stumbling block this time round .
26.3742	If this global warming continues , then part of the territory of the EU Member States will become sea or desert .
4.7198	They have a high standard of living over there and the price of petroleum products is low .
4.9668	I compliment Commissioner WallstrÃ ¶ m on her efforts in The Hague and wish her more success .
359.2741	Without doubt , it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that , in this instance , the American proposal was a third-rate proposal , and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe .
5.4214	Climate change has a huge impact on the developing countries .
5.7897	Or , to put it another way : forests stop being carbon sinks and become carbon sources .
224.4231	Only if we have this credibility will the European Union be able to lead the debate and the action at COPÂVI `` B '' in Bonn .
47.6140	We will have to make our own assessment of what happened , and prepare the documents to make contacts with different parties , and of course with the `` umbrella group '' .
24.0435	Of course the follow up of the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be to ratify an agreement inside the Union .
1038.4775	Before the European Council , Pierre Moscovici and I will still be holding a Ministerial Conclave , next Sunday , to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , as well as a session of the IGC , on Monday at the General Affairs Council .
505.2747	The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause allowing appeal to the European Council , which currently constitutes a real right of veto , would be replaced by a power of retrieval .
2.4880	It may be regrettable , but I have to recognise the position .
25.1817	The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement .
9.2086	The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive European economy .
14.6749	Consumer protection is an increasing concern for Europeans , for obvious reasons which I need not expand upon .
7.5933	We must be ready for this dramatic enlargement .
4.7514	When all is said and done , that is the criterion by which Nice must be judged .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
36.4314	One was that those candidate states themselves must adopt and implement the ` acquis communautaire ' ; that is their task shared with us .
46.8520	We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply to declaim the Charter .
10.4630	It certainly could have been worded better , and , indeed , it can be honed and polished after Nice .
71.7258	I find it quite intolerable that several governments have simply brushed aside the question of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty .
31.8089	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty , evidence indeed that this text , this exercise was always destined to be laid aside .
4.8907	We shall have to speak with just one disagreeable voice in the WTO .
131.5289	In view of the rather dim prospects of success , I do not think it would be a wise move to burden the Intergovernmental Conference with another complex and controversial topic .
21.5239	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide , because it is extremely destructive .
6.5506	Regarding trade policy , the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined .
71.0589	Although the previous Treaty made some progress in extending the formula , it also brought in the crazy formula of codecision plus unanimity for citizenship , social security , the rights of the self-employed and also cultural policy .
126.3959	The very fact that this issue is being debated now is in itself a clear sign of the failure of a policy to strengthen ties of mutual trust between the countries that comprise the Union .
154.2719	This , quite simply , is the situation in which we have been stuck for months at the Intergovernmental Conference , because none of them are willing to give up their toys .
698.7375	The experience of this year has convinced us that , looking beyond Nice towards the future of Europe , the process of constitutionalising the Union must not be carried out by means of the - now dysfunctional - method of negotiations between government representatives .
53.0946	If majority voting does not become the general rule then decision-making will become irretrievably deadlocked , as Mr Prodi rightly commented a moment ago .
11.9791	'' That aspect of subsidiarity has not been heard in our debate today but it is very important .
3186.1468	We did so , the enlargement of 1995 went ahead , the discussion group presided over so well by Carlos Westendorp was created , Amsterdam arrived and now we are going to have Nice and practically nothing has changed , Mr President , we go round and round in circles on institutional issues and never find solutions which will allow us to cope with this hugely ambitious task of enlargement to 27 members .
50.7452	Let us not compound the disappointment which Nice will cause if it is unsuccessful by giving the people huge cause for disappointment in Parliament .
300.6217	We have demonstrated in the past that this goal is achievable and as someone from a Member State that has benefited from a planned transition to membership , I look forward in a positive way to an enlarged and peaceful Europe .
15.2462	But it has to be understood that if you have the right of veto then so does everyone else .
626.9452	But a first transition will also have to be made for the parliament to be elected in 2004 because at least some new Member States will come in before or during the Parliament to be elected in 2004 which will last until 2009 .
23.0824	The President-in-Office of the Council addressed the issue of closer cooperation and said that we are on the way to reaching consensus on this matter .
34.7730	Mr President , on the face of it , the Nice Summit is all about making the necessary adaptations and dealing with the leftovers in the light of enlargement .
320.5237	If we could only take a leaf out of their book , i.e. put a little less emphasis on the things that are going wrong in our part of the world , and a little more emphasis on the things that are going well , then we would be a good deal happier than we are now .
1053.7300	We should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services , as well as investments , intellectual property and competition , in the range of matters which are subject to qualified-majority voting in the Council of Ministers and amend Article 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Treaty accordingly .
53.1205	Granting the European Parliament a right of initiative in this highly sensitive domain would throw the door wide open to party-political despotism .
292.5824	So - as one of you said , referring to American optimism and the way Americans talk about themselves - we should also be capable of valuing what is working well and what is making progress .
11.9852	I would also say that I do not think there is a problem between ` larger and ` smaller ' countries .
472.5865	We have done a great deal of work , but we have run up against the same old problem and I do not think a shift in a single country can start the ball rolling , because yet again we are faced with very tough national , political and democratic situations in twelve of the fifteen countries .
38.2163	To sum up , Mr VÃ © drine , you mentioned that the situation here appears to be too tense , and you also spoke of a certain pessimism .
13.5883	Will you also take steps generally to tighten security in appropriate ways so that there could be no recurrence .
128.3106	I believe that we must take action , which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto , in order to ensure that the guests of Parliament can feel like guests in this House and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour .
7.8867	Hospitality over here and hospitality and respect over there .
18.3160	Thank you for your contribution , Mr Tajani .
245.9741	The best homage to Ernest Lluch and to his memory would be to respect his message - dÃ ¬ aleg in Catalan - can we all give this a chance in the Basque country ?
2.8486	On the other hand of course , everyone can have their say .
661.0687	-LRB- B5-0550 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , to the Commission , on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan .
124.0770	When I speak of organisation , I also mean that the European Union , which makes such strenuous efforts in this field , should be given a corresponding degree of responsibility .
285.7763	Secondly , you will note that the resolution affirms Parliament ' s clear intention to place the security and defence policy squarely on two complementary pillars : civilian crisis management and , should that fail , military crisis management .
39.7525	. -LRB- FR -RRB- Mr President , given our late start and my commitments afterwards , I shall try to make the speech that I had prepared a little shorter .
349.8095	These relationships will , in particular , take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the iPSC and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate and/or ally countries .
32.7641	If we take the events in the Balkans as an example , it can be said that everyone played their role to the full .
328.6873	During this period we have also kept the United States fully informed of developments in European security and defence policy , which is essential if this policy is to develop harmoniously , as is the case at the moment .
376.9768	The second edition of the European Union ' s annual report on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December .
337.9496	You claim that this policy does not aim to compete with the North Atlantic Alliance , which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its members , or to establish a permanent European army .
2426.5634	Furthermore , although I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers , this does not mean that we are seeking to exceed the target set in Helsinki , but that we will have a reserve of qualified forces and forces with various areas of expertise , which will enable us to guarantee that the figure of 60 000 personnel in the Council ' s target would be reached whatever operational conditions they may be required to work in .
559.0195	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to take a few words to describe the profound political significance , which has been approved by the majority of public opinion in our countries , of this new task that will provide Europe with a tool for political influence that it has , until now , lacked .
534.2644	We are now faced with the problem of ensuring that when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe , we mean the whole of continental Europe , because that is what enlargement and the enlargement process is all about .
60.6467	We need to integrate three strands into a coherent whole , Community policies , CFSP , including ESDP , and national action by Member States .
41.7467	Even with our laborious procedures in the Commission , we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to accomplish our objectives .
7.2373	So it is extremely urgent to provide humanitarian aid .
141.2732	Although I do not agree with the cynics who say that it will provide Europe with a pointless toy , it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately deployable in many situations .
6.6035	The EU ought not to develop its own defence involving permanent troops .
1116.0891	Finally , I want to express my group ' s considerable concern about the ever worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do all they can to increase their efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and to support the civilian population , especially now before the winter sets in .
84.7300	Quite simply : where , when and how is this European intervention force expected to take action in the future ?
328.4062	It gives some idea of the terrible toll of these two months of intifada : 270 dead , most of them Palestinian , and nearly 10 000 wounded , many of them crippled for life .
5.3579	Hence his relentless efforts to build up an arsenal of extremely sinister weapons of mass destruction .
1867.7330	Secondly , despite what the previous speaker said , I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable for the European Union to do any more than it is currently doing in relation to the conflict and escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East , especially now , when the United States is going through a transitional period .
40.6923	Mr President , I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs LalumiÃ ¨ re ' s report , which I think is clearly worded and well put together .
7.9197	But there are no clear political objectives , and there is still effectively no common foreign and security policy .
251.7916	The EU has only one problem in this domain , namely the fact that it has yet to arouse public interest in this sort of action , even though such measures are considerably more sustainable and effective than military intervention .
14.3088	Mr President , then there is the budget , of course , and the question as to how it should be apportioned .
104.6222	I say this in spite of the mass of apparent reassurances on this subject that have miraculously been generated in the past few days .
81.5424	At the moment we are grossly short of that capability and ultimately Member States have to consider their defence expenditure plans , which are dramatically different from one country to another .
359.6711	Even those who speculate as to the benefits of certain decisions , such as the decision to create a so-called Euro-army , can not fail to see the important political dimension of this decision and its effect on the cohesion of the European Union .
161.7014	The first attendance in our Parliament of a Minister of Defence is such an historic event that we have reserved the evening sitting for it so that our Members are not overwhelmed by the experience .
5.0719	In all of these , preventive civil crisis management is a better approach than the military option .
21.6548	Does Russia , in the long term , want to be in political union with a non-democratic rÃ © gime ?
49.0056	So Europe is not about to form a new alliance as some people , who are not , I believe , fully informed , have suggested .
105.2785	Pursuant to Rule 42 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Rules of Procedure , I have received a motion for a resolution to end this debate .
70.0989	Given the scale of the task , four committees were involved and a hitherto unknown procedure was applied , in the form of four parallel reports .
19.6215	The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must help modernise the whole way the Commission functions and make it more efficient .
10.4662	So the reform must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved .
24.3805	The differences of view that emerged are not just political but more a reflection of the cultural differences between the Fifteen .
223.7516	The main task of the new internal auditing service , under your direct responsibility , Mr Kinnock , Vice-President with responsibility for reform , will be to analyse the functions and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission .
838.9666	It has been a pleasure to work together and I think the process of addressing a crucial reform of the Commission that is central to the future of the European Union has had added depth and richness because the four of us have been involved .
36.5447	They may expect to move to other European institutions , to be seconded to national governments , or to work in the private sector .
11.9138	Accordingly , our committee repeats its attachment to a strong , independent , effective , transparent and politically answerable Commission .
474.0427	As the Committee on Budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget by activities causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority .
12.5012	This would clearly indicate this Parliament ' s goodwill in relation to moving ahead with this reform with the Commission .
10.5508	Mr President , firstly , I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work .
27.1563	That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice .
1096.9270	Mr President , despite the effort made by the rapporteurs to support the Commission 's work , the fact remains that a coherent , global response aimed at producing a governing policy in addition to merely improving the institution 's administration system has not yet been given to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts .
4.2800	This change of attitude should find expression in openness of government .
388.7035	As I see it , there is no structure of greater importance or substance in the world : 15 nations , soon to become 20 or more , an entire continent ; the most industrialised part of the globe thrives in the Union and , therefore , in the Commission through its structures .
10.4197	Change is never easy .
79.9828	However , while doing so , the Socialist Group considers that the current functioning of the Community ' s public administration is reasonably efficient .
61.8337	We are all familiar with the consequences of this situation and it has tested the dedication and skill of the many people working in the Commission and in its administration .
0.8639	Many thousands of project applications have been awaiting assessment for over a year now .
77.3633	The debate , as we have seen , is not so much about the principles , objectives and timeliness of the reform as about the procedures , pace , timetable , and possible shortcomings or unwanted consequences of its implementation .
1385.3204	I would like to begin by reporting to the House that this morning 's meeting of the College as Mr Van Hulten said earlier , adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory group on standards in public life , as outlined in Action 1 of the White Paper action programme .
5.1227	I think Mr Van Hulten made the point in the course of the debate again .
88.0331	The main aims of the new version are simplification , greater transparency and reinforcement of budgetary principles ; in concrete terms , this means fewer exceptions to the rules , fewer incomprehensible special regimes and more efficient and effective budgetary procedures .
2225.5461	For one thing , it is simply very uneconomical for the Commission if contracts operate in such a way that 20 % of expenditure on item X is reimbursable , while 30 % of expenditure on item Y is eligible for reimbursement , not to mention the frequent need for vouchers covering minimal items of expenditure to be collected and checked .
2941.0806	The next item is the debate on the report -LRB- A5-0337 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ © rez del Arco , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of reform of the Commission on these relations -LSB- 2000/2051 -LRB- INI -RRB- -RSB- .
8.8757	These latter aspects particularly effect the NGOs .
17.8872	Of course this is not enough , but it should at least protect us from caricatures about our poor record of development aid .
1.6850	We will come back to that later because that in itself constitutes a sound framework .
1493.4159	Mr President , I have today returned from Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for brilliant humanitarian assistance following the flood disaster , but , once again reconstruction projects , where we have already allocated the money , are delayed while signatures in Brussels are awaited .
16.9031	Given this situation , there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment .
21.3222	We now have a harmonised scheme to draft country strategy papers and indicative cooperation programmes in all developing countries .
11.4950	Moreover the creation of SEM provided no solution to the continuing mismatch between 8 voluminous administrative resources .
1031.7599	Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I was especially keen to be with you today for the debate in the European Parliament on the first maritime package because you are about to examine three important texts which are a vital step in an issue which recent events have unfortunately made into headline news .
415.7487	This may also enable the Council Presidency to have discussions with the Member States with a view to obtaining the Council ' s approval of your proposals and to adopting the text at first reading , if necessary by qualified majority voting .
51.8742	This swift and focused approach resulting in the two ` Erika ' packages and six proposals has created an enormous momentum .
256.2475	The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right .
45.6958	There must be a clear signal to sub-standard ships that we will not tolerate them in European waters or in European ports .
89.4556	For small tankers , we have adopted a compromise position between the 5000-tonne limit set by the Ã  Ã  Ã  and the 600-tonne limit set by the Commission .
28.8759	This information must be made available to the European , State and port authorities , and to interested members of the public .
236.7157	The transboundary nature of the marine environment , which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region , leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution .
4.4656	Nature protection organisations are also included in cooperation at local level .
77.4413	Amending the directive in terms of greater stringency in its application and the harmonisation of legislation , especially regarding the selection of ships for inspection and the scope of the different types of selection is clearly a positive step .
16.0005	I should like to reiterate that the urgent action upon which you are now insisting is not necessary .
123.0872	I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies , irrespective of what is decided today .
35.9478	A black box , a blacklist : we are in complete agreement with all these things , but there are still a few points I would like to bring to your attention .
533.4906	Faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport , Europe has taken up the challenge and , just 11 months after the loss of the Erika , will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly .
5.4688	In measurable terms , the liberal rationale is effectively opposed to a high level of maritime safety .
1052.5964	Irrespective of the technical measures that will be adopted , one of the major reasons for this lack of safety will remain as long as the exponential growth in traffic linked to the overdevelopment of the North Sea ports is not balanced in the Channel and North Atlantic areas .
22.6286	It would be to the credit of the acting President-in-Office of the Council if he were to set things right in his own country too .
106.1495	Mr President , since the breaking up of the tanker Erika , a package of measures has been devised , under political pressure , with a view to improving the safety of ships at sea .
19.8541	Mr Gayssot , Greek ships have sunk without warning , when there were no storms in the vicinity .
208.5678	Thirdly , when we discuss dossiers of this kind , I think it becomes clear that we do not make the connection between our oil supply , on the one hand , and the fact that we are still using fossil fuels on the other .
5.6006	Let us have the political courage of our ecological ambitions .
51.2606	This shows that , in this area more than any other , we have a tremendous responsibility and we must , it seems to me , stifle any institutional pride we may have .
9.7536	For example , for Finland it is vitally important that Russia is included in these agreements .
107.2023	That applies both to the stricter requirements on the design of oil tankers , better rules on port state control and the tightening up of the rules on classification societies that will also result from this .
90.7965	Mr President , today we are discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports , on which I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on .
889.8771	With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety , I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs , who in a very short time have shown how determined our Parliament is to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea , controls and construction standards , and that it is no longer tolerable that similar incidents should occur again .
68.1136	Mrs Chairman , a series of high-profile ship disasters , particularly involving oil tankers , has hit our continent in the recent past .
39.4592	More than 80 of accidents are associated with human error , but there are reasons for human error , which are social in nature .
9.5159	One Member of Parliament used the term ` traceability ' .
10.0289	The port state control Directive is designed to check compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules .
279.5111	Amendment No 18 introduces port state control in relation to the seafarers ' rest period , however the enforcement of the provisions in respect of seafarers ' hours of work is already fully covered by existing Directive 99/95 .
231.7712	I am happy to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21 to the condition assessment scheme and we agree with the main thrust of the approach suggested but there is need for some fine tuning of the wording to make it clearer .
20.3313	Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point `` K '' are not acceptable .
23.0569	I can assure you that if a shipowner thinks of registering a ship on these registers , he should think twice after our proposal .
91.8875	The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes and during this time she cited dozens and dozens of items and gave a breakdown of the position of the Commission .
7101.2693	Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision concerning a set of actions relating to the trans-European network for the collection , production and dissemination of statistics on the trading of goods within the Community and between the Community and non-member countries -LRB- Edicom -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 458 - C5Â0401 / 2000 - 2000/0201 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB- -LRB- Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs -RRB-
1827.2526	While withdrawing the resolution , however , I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if , in anticipation of the Council of Nice , it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference , instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda .
99.3026	-LRB- Since more than 12 Members of Parliament stood up , the oral amendment was not retained -RRB- -LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
3042.2848	Report -LRB- A5-0337 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ © rez del Arco , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of reform of the Commission on these relations -LSB- 2000/2051 -LRB- INI -RRB- -RSB-
90.0831	I voted against in protest at the fact that the European Union is still not managing to intervene in this matter as it should .
838.8649	Although the proposal to amend the current Directive on ship inspections and the Watts report fall far short of what is actually required , they are a step in the right direction and the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have therefore voted in favour of the report .
294.6064	One can therefore deplore the fact that the Commission proposal has not taken up the idea of the establishment of a European surveillance body on the model of the coastguards in the United States .
295.5316	. -LRB- EL -RRB- We will not achieve safety at sea or protect human life at sea and the environment unless we address the unaccountability of shipowners , introduce strict controls on the state of ships , impose heavy penalties on shipping companies in breach of safety regulations , improve working times for seamen , train them properly and ensure that ships are crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements .
14.3831	Unfortunately , rapporteur Hatzidakis has done the opposite .
1357.0593	The loss of the Erika , which occurred in December 1999 , put the issue of maritime safety on the Community ' s political agenda and it was due to pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission proposed the texts we voted on today , almost a year after the accident .
232.1407	Current compensation funds have been inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for its losses .
8.8704	Madam President , I have already mentioned that I have been to sea in the past .
7.6388	The rapporteur ' s proposals aimed at harmonisation on a European scale can only be positive .
4.0102	It is an important section as it relates to classification societies .
633.9275	Rather , it would be a great success , as the Europe we need on the eve of enlargement is not a supranational Europe which is inflexible , hierarchical and remote , but a Europe which is flexible and close to its people , therefore founded in respect for national democracies .
10.2485	The increasingly open struggle for power between many Member States is clouding the view in terms of possible compromises .
3.7369	The most important task in Nice is to ensure that the EU has effective institutions .
5.5932	Just one week away from the Nice Summit I personally have high hopes .
157.7709	Neither am I in favour of an automatic linking between QMV and codecision and once again believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should also be made on a case-by-case basis .
378.1532	By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , Europe would extend the qualified majority voting currently in force in the Council in trade matters to other areas such as public services , intellectual property , health and education .
118.1310	Thus Parliament waives its right to influence , shuts its mouth and remains silent for the sake of party , State and government loyalties , forgetting its obligations to the people .
20.5606	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice .
126.4499	It is a mistake to divide the union up into an A-team and a B-team , and I therefore can not support a third of the Member States being given precedence .
33.4104	His new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland , Sweden , Finland and Austria .
55.6133	. There is much that the British Conservative group can support in this report , in particular the emphasis on enlargement of the Union .
148.9940	- -LRB- DA -RRB- The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report on setting up a common European security and defence policy .
1822.0513	It is also , however , directed against the people of the European Union who will , in any event , have to finance the new expenditure on armaments which the report advocates and who will not even have a guarantee that these military forces will not one day be turned against themselves for the sake of ` maintaining law and order ' .
117.3488	Equally serious is the intention that any State that does not wish to take part in a mission should be required to pay a financial contribution to be divided up among the States participating in that war .
47.6468	It is no good trying to impose a solution from outside using military methods , because it does not tackle the root cause of the conflict or change public opinion .
227.0239	Â · That military operations should be funded from a Community budget line and that Member States would have to contribute funds to operations even if they did not wish to participate -LRB- Paragraphs 49 and 50 -RRB- .
141.3359	However , it would be to the EU ' s credit if the priorities of the Petersberg tasks were turned around and the focus placed upon model solutions of a civil and humanitarian nature .
13.0765	. I support this report from my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin .
170.7014	But the needs of this category of employers are only brought up in order to call for the introduction of measures to make ` domestic services tax-deductible ' and to adjust ` prices and costs to take account of individuals ' financial resources ' .
158.9394	It is actually incredible that , in the twenty-first century , we should still be recommending that Member States guarantee the right of domestic staff to social security cover and adequate pensions .
31.6456	Too many young people are at risk of their first contact with the labour market being a job in the black economy .
57.6556	The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries , having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves .
459.1046	The Commission reform will be judged on actual evidence , hence the need for regular follow-up reports , which the European Commission will present throughout the programme , and the importance of the overall report , which is expected in December 2002 .
84.0831	. -LRB- FR -RRB- In the still recent past , various scandals and inefficiencies resulted in the resignation of the European Commission in March 1999 .
931.9154	In conclusion , I feel bound to say that we expect this reform , which is essential for the future , to introduce greater discipline and greater transparency into the day-to-day running of the Commission , but it must also lead to a greater sense of accountability on its part , within the strict framework of the competences that have been devolved to it .
80.0296	Conservatives also support the statement in Paragraph 7 of the report that democratic control be ensured and that the three pillar system be enabled to work .
22.1162	-LRB- The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m. -RRB-
572.8281	Our information - and I wish to add straight away that I really can not believe it - is that the President-in-Office of the Council , the President of France , will only be present tomorrow for 30 minutes in order to speak .
2.2133	There seems no possibility of our having a well-thought-through and properly argued position .
170.0235	Whatever the case , let us have a vote on it , and , personally , I support a resolution along the lines suggested by Mr Poettering , Mr Lannoye and others .
194.7597	They continued working on these texts during the night , just as they continued working through the night on figures relating to the division of votes in the Council and of seats in Parliament .
1191.5471	Madam President , I would strongly urge the case for not removing this report by Mr de Roo from the agenda , as it has been excellently prepared , and we will be preparing to adopt a common position on it next Monday and Tuesday in the final Environment Council of the French Presidency .
9.8222	Thank you , Mr Parish .
129.9781	In the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy - as Chair of that committee - he sits there smoking .
48.3447	The political basis is clear : harmonisation of the market whilst maintaining a high standard of public health and consumer protection , and building on existing legislation and advanced scientific knowledge .
12.5939	Their way and concept of life , in which the protection of health is becoming increasingly important , are at stake .
50.1798	This rule can be applied equally to all recreational but dangerous drugs when no one but the person consuming the drug is likely to be affected .
72.6002	Cases have recently been won in the United States against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning people and lying about the toxicity of their products .
174.1007	As regards export from the European Union of cigarettes that are banned within the Union for health reasons , we consider that the only reasonable and consistent solution is to put a stop to this .
82.9718	Rather than learn the lessons of the defeat suffered in Luxembourg on 9 October , we persist in taking a legally indefensible attitude .
29.4982	I have studied carefully what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume : `` No massive job losses in this sector .
57.3302	It is Parliament and the Council who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine , amongst other things , a suitable legal basis for it .
14937.6618	I do not believe we can take such a restrictive route , that is to say , independently of the content - and the substantial content which has been highlighted by Mr Maaten and others - that there is a danger that , if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People ' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , this Parliament , the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying their hands and feet with regard to the legislative development of the Community institutions , which is so important to the development of Community law .
12.0259	The weakness of the proposal resides in the fact that it places heavy emphasis on the promotion of free competition .
321.7979	In conclusion , since the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament has the power of coordination over environmental and consumer protection matters , and it will , of course , work closely with the Council and the Commission in this regard .
845.5432	In fact , it does not actually have anything to do with tobacco : the European Court of Justice 's judgment might just as well have been handed down in relation to an advertising ban on alcohol , for example , or an advertising ban on chocolate , because we know that sugar can also be damaging to human health .
223.3039	I simply do not understand why a majority here in Parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the Member States ' own governments - the governments which , however , also represent the many industries referred to .
74.2094	It is a fact that 80 % of smokers want to stop but there are few policies within the tobacco industry to help those people stop .
201.7076	If we insist on telling other countries what health standards they should set by extending our sensible proposals for the domestic market to exports , we shall put all Mr Maaten 's good work at risk .
54.7638	We are in favour of devising a standardised testing method recognised by all EU Member States , to be implemented by an approved testing laboratory .
120.7726	The health effects of tobacco use are now widely recognised and there is a shared feeling among legislators and the public alike that the time has come to adopt stringent rules and regulations on this product .
215.5171	Consequently , the Community rules will fit well into the future international arrangements , avoiding the danger of trade barriers and reinforcing , at the same time , the protection of consumers and ensuring a high level of health .
27.1717	It would be preferable to wait until the overall question of additives is dealt with in the first Commission report .
48.1210	On laboratory tests , the amendment dealing with approval of tests is superfluous as another article provides for circulation of goods that are in accordance with the provisions of the directive .
236.0222	Madam President , this report is very straightforward : at present , directives on summer time only last for five years , and then have to come back to Parliament to be renewed .
69.5744	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on summer time arrangements that we are examining today is a good proposal .
220.1781	I do not therefore think that we should dwell on this matter for too long in this House ; after all the Member States and also the public have already accepted the summer time arrangements to a large extent and they are acknowledged to be part of our calendar .
75.6022	It is to be welcomed that the proposal states that matters connected with time zones and summer time provisions should be matters for Member States to decide .
84.2566	It would be reasonable to end summer time at the end of September , approximately six months after it starts .
52.0228	It can agree to make appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report of 2007 referred to in Article 5 .
0.2540	There is clarification that interventions in the human germ line can not be accepted .
180.0514	If we accept it we will still have a directive which guarantees therapeutic progress and which does not just leave the protection of patients in Europe as it is but improves it , and that is why I would plead in favour of this compromise .
5.0729	These groups must remain within the scope of the directive .
8.4864	I am also pleased , however , that we have succeeded in clamping down on germ-line gene therapy .
56.2319	I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Liese , on his report and thank him for his efforts to reach a compromise .
368.7357	They include the action plan to combat cancer , the programme of action for the prevention of AIDS , the programme of action for the prevention of drug dependence and the action plan to promote health and , if they are suspended , it will mean an end to the projects and the work being carried out by the networks which have been set up .
340.6786	What a good idea to be able to prepare the way , to proceed as far down the line as possible , to be so close that , even if we need a second reading , we are already within a hair 's breadth of a decision .
62.1453	Furthermore , we must take account of the fact that prevention and promotion as well as monitoring are all going to be increasingly important and therefore they should be given more resources and a higher profile .
320.4505	Madam President , subsequent to the Trakatellis report on the extension of the existing European public health programmes , I wish to express my concern at the direction in which European policy in the field of public health is developing .
3.0149	I understand that the Council has also signalled its agreement in principle .
1185.7243	In the European Union , there is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods , people , services and capital has to live side by side with the maintenance of 15 national borders in the fields of police and criminal justice , which the Member States are making difficult to remove .
866.5753	Finally , the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European legal area , albeit partial and limited , but it responds to the real needs of an enormous number of European citizens who , until now , have been largely unprotected on becoming victims of crime outside their usual country of residence .
6.7207	What did we request for this group of people ?
21.0921	At the same time , special training should be provided for the professionals whose task it is to come into direct contact with victims .
10.6363	Victims must not be victims twice over , first of crime , and subsequently of the system .
357.4798	It is also important in this context , for the next of kin , i.e. the family of the victim , to be apprised of the facts in a discreet and professional manner , should they so wish , and for them to be able to rely on receiving the necessary support and not have to learn everything from the press .
4.5446	This is the case irrespective of the type of crime committed .
79.9464	We must never stray from the basic principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their own actions , either at the level of the Member State or at EU level .
24.4032	In other cases , it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the Union which is not their own .
264.6911	I am delighted by the favourable response shown by Parliament to this first text on such an important subject , so that the area of freedom , security and justice which we are gradually building may offer our fellow citizens support in situations that are often difficult to live with .
9.9991	Vote on a request for urgent procedure
17.4852	-LRB- Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure -RRB-
184.7854	So we agreed with the Council during the night of 23 to 24 November on the main points of what is a perfectly reasonable , although by no means brilliant budget .
11.7882	The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million .
171.6577	However , I also know from the discussions that it is far more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position , obtain a mandate and accommodate pure national chauvinism in a fairly reasonable and tenable overall European decision .
1705.2288	I hope that work will progress on a European recruitment agency - or `` joint recruitment office '' as we call it in our very best German - so that we can jointly overcome the problems which all the institutions - the Council , the Commission , Parliament and the other institutions - will face over coming years , i.e. the problem of staffing over coming years .
6333.9012	The Council refuses to carry out this revision - it seems that now we should have the information - and I want to warn you : using the flexibility instrument two years in a row , two consecutive years , in fact , in less than fifteen months , and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the perspective , is financially draining the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from being replaced and from possible accumulation , which is planned for up to 600 million .
169.3652	This very considerable amount , which matches the heavy requirements for 2001 , will be largely funded by mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 200 million .
69.7385	When the Council voted at second reading for a budget increase of 2.5 % , it took due account of this new factor .
123.7497	Lastly , before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget , I wish to stress the importance the Council attaches to some of the fundamental budgetary rules , in the field of entering appropriations in the reserve , the legal basis and the classification of expenditure .
114.2788	Unlike Nice , all three institutions - the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission - are , I think , well pleased with the final result .
104.5400	Ladies and gentlemen , with the new outbreak of BSE in cattle , immediate action was also required in the budgetary area in order to protect health and consumers and help the farmers affected .
176.8085	Furthermore , the Council has defined a multiannual sum , admittedly indicative in nature , which is compatible with this financial perspective , for the framework programme for aid for reconstruction in the Western Balkans .
8.8269	We fought tooth and nail to add a few extra million euro .
19.4575	I would like to thank Mrs Haug most sincerely .
30.2500	They will therefore think that this 1 % of the European Union budget is being very well used .
23.0585	You said , if I understood you correctly , that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this .
31.8038	So I think that , along with much else which there is too little time to mention , we have a great deal to be pleased about .
482.8893	Although agricultural expenditure , which accounts for almost half the entire budget , will increase by more than 5 % , when the Letter of Amendment has been taken into account , the overall increase in the budget is just 3.5 % .
850.8489	It already looks likely that the huge risk of a clash between MEDA , Mediterranean rim projects and the Balkans will increase over the next few years , despite the fact that we all know that this is where money is urgently needed .
1031.9905	We feel satisfied that we overcame the difficulties blocking the path towards the much sought-after aim of fulfilling the commitments that were given at Helsinki to the candidate countries without destroying the Union , of enabling tomorrow ' s Europe to continue to function effectively .
114.0235	I am talking about real progress , even if it does not go as far as the presidency - which , I should point out , has shown great openness at national level - would have wished .
171.0845	A new legal basis has been laid down for the status of European political parties and Parliament has been given the status of institutional plaintiff laid down under Article 230 of the Treaty .
1.0137	In the last three weeks , progress has been made in three major areas .
92.6632	This is the purpose of the declaration adopted at Nice and of the study that has been commissioned to coordinate the fight against doping at European level .
4.3337	As everyone knows , another threat we face is global warming .
384.2306	Furthermore , at Nice , the European Union established the permanent bodies necessary to define and conduct a common foreign and security policy , which are : a political and security committee , a military committee and a European defence staff .
67.4113	The French Presidency thanks you , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , for this cooperation , for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
8.9089	Now we need to look at the text carefully in Parliament .
94.6322	I would like to point out , by the way , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , that this is paid for by taxpayers .
2664.3350	I consider it to be a failure not only in terms of the European Union ' s stated ambition to change the institutions so that they are capable of properly receiving the new Member States by improving the European Union ' s efficiency , but I also consider it to be a failure in terms of another important aim , which has perhaps not been sufficiently highlighted , which is the rapprochement of the European Union and its citizens .
83.2747	We feel that the right questions are those on the lips of the impressive human tide which converged on Nice from all over Europe on the eve of the Summit .
50.1105	First of all , the Fifteen signed the agreement on the sly and under the smokescreen created by the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
78.0895	My group is disappointed by this Treaty and is worried about the future that it holds for us and we will therefore use all our power to oppose it .
6.5596	Mr President , I give you the floor .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
76.2205	Mr President , I should like to know if the European Parliament 's jurisdiction for summer time has been newly acquired since Nice .
475.0493	As a result of the determination shown by both the Member States and Parliament , laboratories previously discouraged by the complexity of clinical trials will perhaps find the courage to develop the market for children ' s medicines , even if it is not yet big enough to provide a return on the investment !
175.8993	Do we really have to carry on with the change to summer time ? It was brought in at the time of the oil crises , to save energy and has been extended to 2001 ?
1.8170	The status of the victims in criminal proceedings is not always properly protected .
6.2250	Consequently , many travellers and holidaymakers will benefit from this European initiative .
249.0139	Mr President , it is my turn to salute the President of the Commission , who is here , and the Presidency of the Council , which is coming , and to underline that there has probably never been such unanimity expressed in this Parliament on the results of a summit .
374.4883	The one that works is the one that has after all , it seems to me , spent the six months getting the work done in six essential areas , under the leadership of the French Presidency .
399.3870	However , my greatest fear is that Britain , France and Germany will now be able to subvert the delicate balance developed between states of various sizes and between the institutions over several decades .
34.1010	It is hard to see what there is in the Nice decisions which really makes enlargement of the EU any the easier .
3.0977	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have little to say today .
140.7753	The only consequence which I can draw from all this is that , when it comes to voting on the Treaty of Nice , my vote will be a no vote .
151.2935	Mr President , the most important result from Nice was that , in spite of everything , there was a treaty , so that a place can now be prepared for the applicant States .
5.0143	The real winners in this Conference were Blair and Aznar , the Euro-sceptics .
1196.4951	So let us forget about Nice now , and think about post-Nice - and you will forgive me if I pin my hopes on the plan for a grand convention advanced by Belgium for its Presidency , because the evidence is there , we must do something new , we must change the method , we must accelerate history : 2004 is too late , it is too far off , it is too dangerous .
588.5873	Instead , the spirit of Nice clearly amounted to wondering how to block , how to intergovernmentalise , how to be feted at home as the defender of national interests , rather than how to take the European Union forward .
94.9507	Amsterdam and Nice have given us a Europe of imperial rulers , a Europe of national administrations , not a Europe of political unification .
7.6770	We must introduce qualified majority decision-making for the essential topics , or else the situation will become untenable .
516.8846	It is true - I shall paraphrase Mr Bayrou - that I have been sitting here since this morning ; first next to the President of the Republic , then by myself , and the criticism has struck me as moderate and friendly , but criticism all the same .
48.6668	We should not forget that this is actually the first time since 1957 that the grid has been genuinely reformed and revised .
2.9415	We operate under constitutional systems and the powers must not get confused .
9.1483	Thank you very much , Minister .
174.6117	But it has neither been incorporated into the Treaties , nor has a reference to the Charter been put in Paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
7282.0227	Finally , there are a few positive things : the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty ; the article on political parties and their statute ; the right of this Parliament to take the other institutions to the Court of Justice - that is also an important factor of political control ; the new formula for the European Commission , putting the so-called `` lex Prodi '' into the Treaty , strengthening the President and the new composition of the Commission - a reasonable compromise which I accept and will work over time ; and , as my colleague , Mr Tsatsos pointed out , the way forward to the future .
93.0729	Mr President , we have already made a thorough assessment of what happened in Nice , but we should remember that Nice began with a very restricted agenda .
37.2534	Let us take one thing at a time : the charter was not included in the Treaty , not so much as a mention .
1.5618	We want to prove to the heads of government that we know best .
72.3446	Notwithstanding all the self-congratulation by the French government this morning , the IGC simply did not finish on a good note .
31.1154	Mr President , it is not easy to criticise the French presidency during this debate as it is not present .
26.5265	Mr President , the Nice Summit has shown that Intergovernmental Conferences have reached the end of their useful life .
20.2040	2001 budget -LRB- continuation -RRB-
0.2069	However , this does not mean that we could have done more or better .
37.0703	These maximum levels force the Commission to set priorities within the confines of a budget , in the way that every government has to .
96.6924	The vote that is to follow this debate will mark the end of the long , complex process of approving the European Union budget for 2001 .
92.4655	That is what we have done : we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272 ; the financial perspective has been maintained , even though we have used the flexibility instrument .
62.0148	Let me just say to the Council that , as far as this game is concerned , we have not run out of balls and this side intends playing until we get the right result .
1487.8724	We do not want there to be a proposal for revision for next year in the Colom Resolution , because we want to wait for the World Bank evaluation , but we share his criticism that this method of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major external objectives of the Union and the very definition of the financial perspective .
22.8252	For all this to be possible , there will have to be extensive prioritising in the future , too .
19.7935	That is the only right and the only sensible way of investing the money at our disposal on behalf of our fellow citizens .
600.3962	If we include the expected supplementary budget , it comes out at nearly 8 % , while other areas , such as training policy , the whole of internal policy - including research - , foreign policy , administration and accession aid have together only risen by 1.1 % .
10.9374	And we shall have the opportunity of continuing this excellent cooperation on the supplementary budget in January .
47.7642	It also behoves us to criticise the relations between Russia and the Baltic States , which are still to be regularised .
0.4339	We will follow the developments in Russian society and internal politics with great interest .
126.4262	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the common strategy towards the Russian Federation was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union .
72.7754	Even if President Putin guarantees the democratic development of his country , that does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russian Federation .
0.4082	Slyness does not become us : we must build a Europe of economic cooperation .
6.1847	Mr Van Orden is quite right in what he says regarding the Caucasus .
298.0398	Anyone looking at Russia from the outside and with the odd personal experience from visiting the country itself and speaking to Russian counterparts will soon be in danger of selectively tailoring reality in the Russian Federation to fit his personal image .
43.0248	In the political sector , the common strategy towards the Russian Federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue .
117.2090	I should here like to highlight the value of our really emphasising the seriousness of Russia ' s in actual fact being in a political union with Belarus .
4.1510	Do you intend to support a project such as this , Commissioner Patten ?
192.3178	In this context , as Parliament will know , at the last summit between the European Union and Russia , Romano Prodi launched a far-reaching dialogue on energy .
242.5797	I very much hope to visit Kaliningrad myself in the early part of next year , and not just because Immanuel Kant spent the whole of his life there .
423.8879	I congratulate the honourable gentleman once again on an extremely good report on a very important issue , to which I am sure we will return in this Parliament over the next few years again and again .
5.7692	You are placing me in a very difficult position .
42.0064	Mr President , this debate is already overdue because the BSE crisis has huge implications for feedingstuffs , both home-grown and imported .
1640.8797	The Council has expressed its concern at many meetings with Russia at all levels , particularly seeking to induce Russia to avoid the excessive use of force and to avoid any extension of the conflict , to carry out independent and efficient inquiries into human rights violations , to support the OSCE Assistance Group in fulfilling its mission and , finally , to ensure that humanitarian aid is distributed properly .
49.0087	Mr President , a point of order : it is standard practice in the House for questions which can not be adequately answered orally to be submitted in writing .
36.6261	-LRB- Interruption by Mr Posselt -RRB-
17.9373	This directive dates from 1992 .
6.2706	This is what we should be striving for .
5.3395	These groups are obviously not excluded under the new proposal .
632.4365	The Presidency and a number of Member States have already received various letters from the ComitÃ © europÃ © en des fabricants de sucre -LRB- European Committee of Sugar Manufacturers -RRB- regarding the Commission ' s proposals , which they will take into account in their deliberations .
25.2876	Question No 6 by -LRB- H-0886 / 00 -RRB- :
75.6462	First of all I have to say that , in my opinion , the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered Mr Korakas ' question .
119.6383	This authority must now be set up , and I think the European authorities have now become very aware of the issue , and that we must forge ahead .
90.5868	Has the Presidency representative , in this instance the French Ambassador to Algeria , actually met Mr Ahmed Taleb ?
525.3103	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001 .
8.2470	The partnership agreement contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights .
49.9597	. -LRB- FR -RRB- As the Council has emphasised to the honourable Member in the previous answer , the process of the mutual recognition of judgements will afford better protection of individuals ' rights .
7.8955	I would like to press him further .
5.2494	In particular , it provides the political scrutiny and strategic administration of a military crisis management operation .
1186.7854	I should just like to point out that the Treaty system differentiates between taxes and indirect taxes which must be harmonised in order to ensure the proper establishment and smooth running of the internal market - according to Article 93 - and the approximation , laid down in Article 94 , of legislation which has a direct bearing on the establishment or running of the common market , including legislation on direct taxation .
13.7706	Allow me briefly to summarise these three main sectors .
167.1550	If this pattern of behaviour continues , where in case of doubt each party fights the other , it could break up the Stability Pact for South-East Europe , which is based on regional cooperation .
3.3021	In the end we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia , meaning cooperation on both sides .
109.3890	Mr President , our Group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the feasibility of negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with the Republic of Croatia .
939.0789	Mr President , during the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , I had the opportunity to support many Croatians in their efforts towards the freedom and prosperity that they , like other peoples on our continent , identified with their integration into the European institutions .
139.2032	I have to say that , on the basis of Croatia 's performance this year , I have every confidence that we will be able to set a brisk pace .
69.2377	That is certainly our approach , and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months testifies to that .
369.7940	We owe it to Croatia to give the government and people of Croatia every help in the years ahead and we are extremely grateful to the honourable Member for his wise advice in ensuring that we pursue this route .
287.8740	It is incomprehensible , in this respect , that the Laskar Jihad was given the chance this spring to go to the Moluccas in their thousands , in order to stoke up the conflicts there again .
6.3384	In Timor , the militias block the return of the refugees and relief workers are besieged .
156.7011	On behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I will restrict what I have to say to three points .
29.7530	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on the excellent job she has done .
6.6877	The country is not unique in that respect .
37.9451	Ongoing violence on the Moluccas , in Aceh and in Irian Jaya is causing great suffering among the people .
3.0520	Here , tomorrow , we shall have the presentation of the Sakharov Prize .
287.9416	However , following the latest reports from the Indonesian archipelago , we are compelled to ask whether the situation does not in fact look more serious , more precarious still for President Wahid and his brothers-in-arms , than the report would suggest .
20.9598	If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds , not merely words .
2.1842	I think the report is extremely valuable in shedding light on what has been happening .
8.4079	It is clear that Indonesia 's difficulties will not be solved overnight .
10.7551	Protection of Communities ' financial interests
21.2963	We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently , especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure .
128.2302	So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud .
1.6983	I think precisely that should be the end result , of Nice too .
70.9740	We welcome negotiations between the Member States concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime , but we shall not submit our countries to a federal EU prosecution authority .
164.0449	I should also like to know why the Commission 's paper on this subject had its release delayed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro .
8.4563	I put an amendment down to name these countries because it is about time they were named and shamed .
26.0677	Actually I am sure that it is also in OLAF 's interest to make the selection of senior officials transparent .
133.4791	However , we must be careful within the European Parliament not to miss seeing the log in our own eye because we are concentrating so hard on the splinter in our neighbour 's eye - the Commission .
1.4971	We are trying to extinguish a fire and are suffocating in the smoke .
9.5911	And no one can understand it , including myself .
41.1657	To achieve this aim fully , I shall highlight four requirements that I consider essential in the work of the budgetary control authority .
1.6594	As far as Parliament itself is concerned , the problem is the Treaty .
151.3059	It does make us rather apprehensive , Commissioner , to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs ' rights .
19750.7824	They concern a number of courses of action that the Budgetary Control Committee can take when it finds problems in different areas , including recommending to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the headings concerned in the following year 's budget ; to authorise no transfers of appropriations to take place involving increasing the headings concerned for a certain period until further internal investigations are concluded ; up to asking the President of the Commission to ask for the resignation of any individual Commissioners concerned with the serious problems found , a kind of EU Caesarean .
61.9294	The report calls for detailed reviews of operational activities , thorough checks of budget headings and irregularities together with an assessment of the Commission 's internal performance .
67.0592	Commissioner , the point of departure for forwarding information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the Interinstitutional Agreement .
471.6200	But unless the directive is amended , the end result of this common position would be that not only do we not have a level playing field with North America , we do not even have one within Europe .
21.3405	I really do not know why we should not eventually succeed in reaching a compromise in this case , as with all other directives .
24.8189	It is a proposal that has gone down a long and , I fear , stormy road in order to overcome some of the existing problems .
33.8767	The first amendment refers to Article 4 , which establishes what will be the competent authority for supervising the bid .
46.4167	Now we have a proposition that would lead to muddle , forum shopping , potential litigation at a delicate moment in a corporate deal .
200.0178	In the UK the regulation of takeovers through the voluntary code of practice administered by the takeover panel has been highly successful : a good example here of a pragmatic approach to a highly complex issue where legislation will be less appropriate .
101.0358	But , more than that , the bigger prize is that we are able to take forward the Lisbon agenda of creating a competitive , dynamic European economy .
520.6305	Here in the European Parliament we are chiefly concerned with finding minimum European rules to regulate the major fields of tension in take-over law , for instance the boards against the shareholders , large shareholders against small ones , companies against the stock market .
69.0427	Some of the amendments proposed by Parliament further improve the text of the Council ' s common position because they highlight points that could lead to interpretation difficulties and push for speedier transposition of the directive .
153.9175	After all , it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other , because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
611.8648	Moreover , the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years , which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales .
121.5032	Accordingly , this matter should be put before the Austrian legislator instead of attacking the European legislator who is only creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses .
306.9038	It is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand , since this is the only way that the European Union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative artists worldwide .
2.7804	I put my trust in the wisdom and farsightedness of this House .
568.3444	In Germany , for example , in 1998 , of 7 000 artists who transferred their rights , only 274 actually got any money from it and 40 % of the droit de suite was taken up in costs in levying the sum .
1.5743	In short , there is no need for harmonisation of this sort in this area .
14.2724	A similar amendment was rejected at first reading .
8.4252	They thought the translations could be made available in spite of this fairly difficult and densely packed timetable .
17.2687	Unfortunately , however , we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion .
19.2423	Our committee proposed that this be undertaken one year earlier .
2.8939	This Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and will continue to support them .
4.0637	Technology and changing markets will drive change , in any event .
0.2415	We can not find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains .
281.0416	A reduction of the universal service - the very core of the postal service sector - to 50 grammes would seriously put at risk the ability of the national postal operators to deliver a universal service at an affordable tariff to people , irrespective of where they live .
61.0775	I remind my Conservative MEP colleagues of the mess they got into in the UK when they tried to privatise the British post office .
81.9999	We have turned the safety net for post users into a hammock for those large postal companies where they can carry on doing what they are now getting away with .
35.2857	I am very pleased about that , because this notion of special services was in any case intended to exclude new technologies from the scope of universal service .
6.8109	We can not , Madam President , Commissioner , and will not , tolerate such a situation .
53.9324	This is why the European Commission has not suggested liberalising all postal services as a second step in the process .
21.2238	It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union .
331.4677	In the Dutch newspapers , Mr Bolkestein recently criticised the French for adopting a non-liberal attitude , or , at least , that is how the headline in one of the newspapers read .
184.2930	Spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter , for it established the fund and has used it , and I would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund , the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application .
152.9336	We are voting tomorrow , and I hope the amendments by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx will be adopted , otherwise I will have no choice but to vote against this report .
12.8924	The Royal Mail competes with other companies and delivers letters to me in MalmÃ ¶ in Sweden .
1972.3047	Madam President , Commissioner , what we have learned from the debate or , rather , the controversy created by Commissioner Bolkenstein in his quest to liberalise the postal services , undertaken in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in contravention of the rules defined by this directive is that , under cover of progressive and status-enhancing terms such as modernisation , liberalisation and keeping pace with rapid technological developments , we are slipping into a situation in which the social quality of countries is declining .
80.6985	It is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund , as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services , will last .
8.6100	These limits and delays also contributed to a debate in which the ends are often confused with the means .
3.6534	Madam President , in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion .
346.8156	Madam President , firstly , please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , because his work has been complicated and difficult and he has had to try to find a balance between dramatically differing proposals , positions and points of departure and arrival .
109.3524	I fear that this will mean that the present monopolists can further strengthen their position on the back of the taxpayer and that the threshold for newcomers will be raised quite a bit .
8.3457	I am also glad to see that our continental Liberal friends are giving the lead to British Liberals .
18.5682	I certainly recognise that there is nothing wrong with the concept of liberalisation per se and that it can bring benefits to consumers .
285.0501	It was justified because it is in keeping with the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union which prioritise the establishment of the internal market through the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment .
21.7439	Universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and everything we do is designed to create a proper climate for its improvement .
0.2519	Special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged .
185.6104	He said that between now and the end of the decade the opening to competition of virtually the whole postal market appears to be inevitable .
2.0923	I stand for cast-iron guarantees that universal service obligations will always be protected .
196.0068	That is why I can not and will not be silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a failure to meet properly the challenges set to us all at Lisbon .
22.9265	Thank you very much , Mr Simpson .
36.0562	Well , I would remind you that the main objective of this common organisation of the market is to guarantee access to the Community market for these countries ' products .
281.1954	It is therefore crucial to find , in addition to the EUR 300 rating preference , a means of permitting them effective access to quota ` C ' and of making an ongoing assessment of the impact of the system on these producers .
699.9257	For example , we feel bound to express our concern about banana production in certain ACP countries , in the small producing countries of the Caribbean and in certain countries of Western Africa , which have traditionally been suppliers to the banana market and to whom we have commitments that we can not ignore .
146.4312	I therefore ask the Members of this House to endorse this report in its entirety , as did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
20.6030	Meanwhile , the US first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods .
121.1118	Powerful interests are at play , especially those of the Americans , who , although they are not banana-growers themselves , have invested American capital in the trading corporations .
133.4279	It sometimes seems as though the Commission , in its proposals on deregulation in international trade and agricultural production , has gone even further than the Cairns Group .
77.6887	It is a pity that the Commission and the Council still insist on a solution that may seriously jeopardise this production , particularly after 2006 .
5.9201	Successive WTO rulings do not say that we can not give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers .
754.6032	Hence , the transitional period should be about fifteen years , certainly not less than ten , and the compensatory aid should include guaranteed earnings for Community producers and a market for the produce of the outermost regions , and so aid should also be included for the bodies that market the bananas produced there .
1203.6633	I hope that it will listen to our arguments today , for this system proposed by the Commission , this tariff preference , even if it were to amount to EUR 300 , is in danger of proving completely useless in practice , for the ACP producers will be wiped out by the so-called ` first come , first served ' system .
12.0529	VOTE
26.9125	-LRB- Parliament approved the Commission proposal -RRB-
7.6648	The Commission rejects all the other amendments .
10.9006	Before the vote :
19.3762	-LRB- Parliament accepted the oral amendment -RRB-
436.1945	Report -LRB- A5-0376 / 2000 -RRB- by Ms Morgan , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on reform of budgetary control procedures and institutions -LSB- 2000/2008 -LRB- INI -RRB- -RSB-
1.8535	Most smokers neither know the full risks nor bear the full costs of their choice .
39.8712	In my long parliamentary career , which has now spanned 35 years , I have always adhered to this principle .
8.5482	I fear they will hope in vain .
13.5450	This is our last-ditch attempt to put labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the true cost of smoking .
34.3927	Lehne report -LRB- A5-0368 / 2000 -RRB-
25.7564	This is a judgment that I still regard as relevant and correct , which is why I have voted against the report in its entirety .
126.7197	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7 % .
34.4378	By voting against this directive , my group would also like to give out a political signal that we should not waste our time laying down superfluous rules .
2876.6795	If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past , how is it possible to have the slightest confidence in Mr Putin , the executioner of the Chechen people , the godfather of the various mafias and the man who endeavours to eliminate all opposition in civil society -LRB- unions , political parties -RRB- in order to strengthen his personal power ?
543.9087	Of course , Indonesia does not really deserve this development of closer relations with the Union because its leaders have not exactly distinguished themselves in terms of great democracy or commendable actions , but we must think about the Indonesian citizens , and so I say roll on the development of closer relations and I welcome the provision of this aid .
3.5270	The unit is only to be involved with criminality committed by EU employees .
485.5146	- -LRB- FR -RRB- The Theato report on combating fraud reveals that the Central European Bank , no doubt the better to prove its celebrated independence , thought it inappropriate to subscribe to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF .
9.3786	That concludes the vote .
9.1021	Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this .
1.6795	Ladies and gentlemen , let us not have occasion to change the name .
115.0042	The fact is that the ` tariff only ' system is an important factor which ensures that the Commission 's proposal is well balanced and can serve as a basis for progress in the Council .
0.3713	Marketing schemes for these bananas are also part of national and regional rural-development programmes .
6.2325	Europe and the United States work closely together in defence of the values we share .
348.9270	We expect there to be discussion on a future new WTO round as well as some discussion of the implications for that round of the wide array of new bilateral trade initiatives being debated in the American hemisphere .
5305.7282	He has rightly said that the transatlantic relationship is one which has expanded greatly in the last ten years - mostly , it is true , on the American side thanks to President Clinton ; but I think that history will relate that there has also been a European contribution to this new relationship , which has been a fundamental key to the way in which it has worked , through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and through the new Transatlantic Agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995 .
51.6598	So it will be important to change tack here and write a real Transatlantic Agenda for the year 2001 .
201.7523	I will conclude with the Dominican Republic , which says : `` The WTO was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game .
453.3331	Secondly , even if the retreat of the Communist threat is a cause for rejoicing , the collapse of the Soviet Union has left us with a single superpower in the form of the United States of America .
29.3417	I know he has a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees with an interest in these issues .
4.3425	The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
81.7128	These objectives , the main one and the secondary ones , will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the Commission must be judged .
156.1797	We know that a solution such as this - establishment in one country with the opportunity to provide services to the whole of the Union - could lead to an avalanche towards those countries with the lowest taxes .
1740.2082	Thus , in 1992 , an agreement was reached , at the time considered a minimum harmonisation , by which the standard rate for VAT could not be less than 15 % and the Member States would have the power to apply one or more reduced rates of not less than 5 % , with , however , derogations provided for in this case .
162.4005	We called for the European Commission to monitor to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the Council and to Parliament .
366.0682	In short , the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage Europe 's e-economy , a right signal would be zero rate VAT for our own e-business rather than trying to impose our problems on others .
34.7781	If we are to be able to live up to the requirements for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases we must take every measure possible to limit them .
59.6843	The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU .
6.0474	Positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be abolished .
3.3255	Companies from countries which are not members of the EU are not taxed at all .
94.4096	Compact discs are not exactly antediluvian , and it would appear that these have to be taxed , whereas programmes circulating on the Internet are apparently to be exempt from tax .
64.4068	Nevertheless , the solution proposed will prove to be technically unmanageable and a barrier to the development of on-line transactions within the Union , at the very time when everybody is hoping for its expansion .
17.4186	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the tax systems of the Union are becoming ineffective and are yielding less and less revenue .
9.9578	We should be thinking out ways to encourage e-commerce and not thinking up new ways in which to tax it .
3.4414	Liberals tell us that as little State involvement as possible is required .
8.1704	The Primarolo group has devised simple rules which must be applied .
90.9980	By way of an objection , the Group that I represent in this House believes that we should correct the fact that , while newspapers normally enjoy reduced VAT rates , this reduction is not applicable to electronic newspapers .
18.9702	So the taxation of kerosene is only possible on the basis of an international consensus if a level playing-field is to be guaranteed .
5492.7279	I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism which this Parliament voted on a few months ago , namely , that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax , at least in a short term , we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect , including an emissions charge .
664.9726	In fact , the industry pays 100 % of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges , amounting to US $ 4bn in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport , such as rail and road , which are still heavily subsidised .
21.2041	The current situation is an unfavourable one .
124.2332	In this context , I am sorry to say that aircraft emissions do pose a problem ; although air traffic is not responsible for a large percentage of pollutant emissions , its volume is growing very rapidly , and we must therefore avoid any temptation to trivialise it .
293.2233	The scheme will be harmful to the development of SMEs , both within and outside the Union , especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover .
143.8598	If we are too greedy in this matter now under discussion we will really be jeopardising the future of e-business , which is so important for Europe .
134.5372	The guiding principle that suppliers from outside the Community who supply to customers within the Community need only register at one location must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between the Member States .
1293.0897	Given that the debate in the Council is still under way and also given the Commission ' s wish to bring the topic of VAT and e-commerce to a successful conclusion in the short term , I am of the opinion that at this moment in time , it would be desirable not to accept Parliament ' s amendment proposals formally but to try to incorporate these proposals as far as possible in the negotiations with the Council .
5.3473	This is why I can not accept the proposed amendments .
4.6278	Thank you very much for all the dossiers you have addressed this week .
340.0395	For its part , just three months after the accident , the Commission assumed its responsibilities and adopted a first package of measures , which the European Parliament approved fully on 30 November .
323.9414	In fact , with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force , it is crucial that we standardise practices and exercise greater control over the implementation of Community rules , in order to prevent significant and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety which could arise within the Union .
5.2154	Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for her continuing commitment in the field of maritime safety .
206.2703	I would like to remind Members that , in air safety , the amounts of compensation paid in Europe and North America are not equal to the amounts paid in other countries .
610.1362	Secondly , I would say that it is French law which will have the power to confiscate or freeze the assets of a specific company in order to compensate for damages or anything else , and it could establish liabilities beyond those laid down according to the objective criteria provided for in current international legislation on hydrocarbon pollution .
62.9774	The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network .
602.7815	That was changed in the face of criticism , especially from Ireland and France , and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer : it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all , including British lorry drivers .
91.4112	I am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available , whether it comes from within or outside the European Union , meets the highest standards .
7.4974	Naturally I understand the honourable Member 's concern .
3.5919	I am sorry to have to tell you that I am not satisfied with your reply .
7.9097	The point that the honourable Member makes is an important one .
232.8046	In Nigeria , Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base .
258.7550	In its report adopted on 15 November the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 has not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices .
18.9232	I believe that the intentions as a whole are hugely reassuring , but the reality is that meanwhile our dockyards are closing down .
28.7986	Question No 38 by -LRB- H-0868 / 00 -RRB-
63.6906	Mr Commissioner , I can understand that you do not wish to change your decision despite the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty .
7.4483	This initiative is based upon a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP .
4.2196	I represent some growers and I am thus very concerned indeed .
161.1730	We are working on these in committee , but no decisions were taken on the matter this week , as Poul Nielson was absent on a visit to the Balkans .
154.9503	The safeguard clause is currently being worked upon and , if Mr Clegg needs background arguments in order to talk with the sugar beet farmers , I shall make these available to him .
20.6399	I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for what was in all respects a very positive and excellent reply .
19.0592	I will discuss that issue with my services once the budget resources for next year are clear .
112.1181	At present , the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have .
821.2679	Just as the law courts in DÃ 1/4 sseldorf , Munich and elsewhere in Germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in London , a Community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning Community patents would have to be very specialised .
582.5004	To prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one , on 13 July of last year , the Commission reminded the Member States concerned in a letter , of their obligation to designate courts for the Community trade mark .
52.2881	As the honourable Member of your House is aware , the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project .
28.7986	Question No 47 by -LRB- H-0877 / 00 -RRB-
37.8473	This means therefore that the Commission will only deploy the legal aids it has at its disposal within the meaning of the regulation .
190.7454	The question is : who should these students apply to in order to confirm that , if they take these courses and complete their studies in Britain , they are entitled to have results ?
7.1400	The king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs !
786.5030	This can also be regarded as a competition-related issue , as duty-free goods can continue to be sold in the southern part of the Baltic on the crossing between Stockholm and Helsinki , whereas they are not permitted to be sold on the journey between UmeÃ ¥ and Vasa .
81.4656	What we need to do is to rectify this situation by fostering and encouraging multilingual content , as this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry .
30.0182	The problem I am mainly concerned with is that small enterprises do not always have sufficient guarantees and a proven business track record to offer investors .
46.6299	In order successfully to complete the ambitious development of this European e-content programme , the procedures envisaged need to be simplified and made secure .
84.9101	For that reason , the objective behind public subsidies for the EU ' s content industry must also be the achievement of high levels of education and culture in all its diversity .
205.6364	On the other hand , we have the communications networks which need a constant supply of content in order to fill their web pages and which see nothing wrong in subordinating the content , in ransoming it and using it without paying any particular attention to the rules of production .
21.8801	Mr President , I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it .
12.6698	That is why I support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies .
131.2907	First , on the social and cultural function of digital content , the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content .
12.7733	Assessment and management of environmental noise
254.0517	I am indeed grateful for the support which the Christian-Democrats and , in fact , part of the Liberal Group , have lent to this one specific amendment to curb all aircraft noise .
244.2954	Only this year , six years overdue , and under enormous pressure from the French Government , has the Commission at last proposed European harmonised noise indicators .
59.8328	It is a moderate proposal , for Scandinavia already has stricter standards in place than those proposed for the year 2012 .
11.5114	Airports such as Orly , Schiphol and Barcelona already meet strict requirements .
71.6027	Another important proposal we have made , which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise , is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated .
123.0742	The lack of common standards in the European Union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different Member States .
21.8914	That is why , in my opinion , the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange are so important .
0.4651	Mr President , first of all I must say that I welcome this report .
41.9056	That , in principle , was the idea behind Amendment No 36 , although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet .
193.4728	We should examine that very carefully and then pursue the implementation of both parts of the combined approach , namely the establishment of limit values for the various sources of noise on the one hand and quality standards for noise sources on the other .
11.1643	We needed more time and I regret we did not have it even though I generally support the framework directive .
297.7631	Once Member States have provided the comparable information then the Commission will consider the question of Community limit values and other measures to reduce the numbers of people affected by noise and report back to the Council and Parliament .
11.8059	Additives other than colours and sweeteners
15.8308	These are the three criteria .
318.3637	Thank you Mrs Thyssen , I sympathise with you , for while you have a carrot in your throat , I have a frog in my throat , as we say north of the Rhine , but there is a bit of a flu bug going round in this House .
6.9695	Chronic dietary problems also increase the risk of cancer .
14.7595	It then also transpired that the Commission did not have the right tools to tackle the problem adequately .
387.4383	There is another stage scheduled for tomorrow , when Mrs Marit Paulsen from the Liberal Group will be at the helm and she will be given the chance to further tighten the present directive .
222.4851	Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument available to ensure that Community legislation in animal nutrition is properly enforced and , in the event of emergencies in third countries , rapid reactions are possible .
169.8506	We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities , and , until now , these matters , as far as cities specifically are concerned , have played second fiddle .
3.0734	The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner .
165.3130	The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end , and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions .
23.0290	Reduced traffic and conversion from fossil fuels at a local level is necessary to achieve a change in the climate threat we are experiencing .
6.4833	Many have suggested that the budget is too small .
99.6564	It is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the Commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development .
629.9007	The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the WTO ' s dispute settlement bodies consider that the precautionary principle is applicable in environmental or public health issues , occasionally even against the Europeans , as may be seen from the case -LRB- still pending -RRB- of cheese produced from milk straight from the cow .
20.2243	Damage limitation and compensation must not be our aim ; our paramount goal must be to prevent damage to people 's health and property .
359.0443	As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only .
11.3561	There is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products , nor can there ever be .
63.9694	Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly , it is vital to involve all key stakeholders , including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application .
17.0280	And lastly , that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations , particularly financial considerations .
23.2378	In order to apply the precautionary principle , it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects .
3875.1447	Only yesterday in Lisbon , the American professor , George Carlo , who for the last seven years has been entrusted by the Food and Drugs Administration with a study on the effect of the radiation on human health , revealed at first hand that there is the risk that the use of mobile phones might promote the appearance of brain tumours , Alzheimer ' s disease and skin lesions .
75.0685	Mr President , the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions that we monitor and check in order to be able to intervene to make sure that things do not go wrong .
92.3061	What must at all costs be avoided is a situation in which the application of this principle curbs innovation and economic activity , creates undue caution and resistance to change on the part of industry and becomes a means of discouraging competition .
29.8711	Parliament must have noted that the Commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution .
31.3629	The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
466.5333	Article 2 of the Charter enshrines the right to life , and each time someone is killed by terrorism in Spain , the whole of the European Union senses the relevance of what is one of its most crucial principles .
33.3478	We do not wish to replace the legitimately established institutions , but we wish to persuade them to protect our rights and freedoms without making concessions to terrorists .
12.0529	VOTE
60.0710	She also recalled the Council 's observation concerning the classification of budget headings for the Commission 's pre-retirement plan and for administrative expenditure on fisheries agreements .
19.3421	-LRB- Parliament adopted the legislative resolution -RRB-
6.7983	I believe this is something of an anachronism !
132.2453	Although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low , they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them .
3002.5863	This abolition , which began to take place in the middle of last year , as we had anticipated , resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made , to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent .
38.0946	This paragraph is a perfect carte blanche for the effective closure of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg .
433.2034	Before I left for Strasbourg , the pensioners and elderly people of Bergamo said to me : ` Christmas is coming and we in Bergamo celebrate both Christmas and the feast day of St Lucy .
52.2907	Moreover , we are highly critical of the over-production of agricultural produce and of the use of information funds by the EU to sell this surplus .
33.0018	Mr President , I voted for the GarcÃa - Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce .
51.9259	Mr President , I will do my best to remedy this before 2004 with a few explanations of votes in favour of Malta .
65.1743	Nevertheless , I must say quite seriously that this is as much as I can accept from a Europe which I feel to be too liberal !
27.2439	A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier .
44.0732	They will keep the pressure on , and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams .
106.5386	The liberalisation of postal services on the terms proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent , and I therefore voted in favour of the report and all the amendments moved that expressed this position .
19.8671	de Roo report -LRB- A5-0378 / 2000 -RRB-
148.8422	We also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 30 and 31 , being not convinced that they are WTO compatible .
1.7149	This is a form of globalisation that scorns the most basic human rights .
67.5983	This is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity -LRB- Article 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Treaty on European Union -RRB- .
102.5068	It must be emphasised that linguistic minorities , rather than being overwhelmed by the globalisation brought about by the Internet , have discovered that it opens up new cultural and economic horizons .
138.5458	Mr President , in the absence of any other results , the horse-trading in Nice has at least clearly shown the intentions of the European Union ' s key players .
0.2280	In this respect , the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided .
304.8967	The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available , four days later - is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion .
116.9252	The only way of preventing dangerous conflicts in future is to adhere to the traditional concept , according to which Europe is founded on mutual respect between national communities .
6.8061	The Nice Summit concluded on Sunday with an agreement that should lead to a draft treaty .
7.7870	The resolution on Nice , voted today , does not reflect this .
1666.1604	Lastly a mention of social policy , which France had backed when it opened its Presidency , but which ended up amounting to very little , apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents with very vague contents which clearly did not match up to the existing problems and the enormous discontent , of which the workers ' demonstration in Nice was also a major expression .
25.4682	In the really important areas such as taxes , public levies , social policy , asylum and immigration , the old order has evidently survived .
817.1670	The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that , when all is said and done , the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody ' s child : the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them ; the political groups corresponding to the Member States ' governments have done all they can to criticise .
142.6582	On the contrary , the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power .
446.7534	If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born -LRB- 1944 -RRB- when the Chicago Convention was concluded , it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon .
92.7263	As there is no such thing as zero risk , scientists - or at least politicians - should apply the criterion of proportionality , consider there to be risks and assume their responsibilities .
120.2420	The House had also fought , however , for the reduction of the funds available for innovative measures to be offset by means of resources from the flexibility instrument , a demand which is recorded in a declaration on the financial perspective in the Interinstitutional Agreement .
1177.6061	All have a role to play in this important area for , in the truly global market which is now upon us , it is the new ideas - properly resourced , cogently and realistically supported - which will ensure that we in Europe can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular .
514.8201	Regarding the budget , some serious words were said here in the previous speech : EUR 400 million is really just the minimum for financing , and we will have to utilise the additional financial possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument in the second half of the period , as the report states .
40.3834	Contrary to what the report concludes , I do not believe that this would automatically result in a loss of any European added value .
692.2653	As we all know , unemployment in the European Union is concentrated in the least economically and technologically developed regions , especially Objective 1 areas , and it is necessary that innovative measures should not just simply be technological in nature but that they should also be governed by an explicit desire for economic development and job creation .
797.4383	When I go back to my own region , east of England , and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period , I doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in .
445.9107	Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank and congratulate Helmuth Markov on his constructive , extremely competent and serious presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures under the ERDF for the period 2000-2006 .
107.4487	Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy have not been overlooked in the guidelines and may give rise to innovative measures relating to the third issue , which is regional identity and sustainable development .
18.6665	However , we wish projects to be selected at regional level , as Mr Berend understood in his intervention .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
316.6195	That is why , in this report and the three additional motions on the table , we have called on the Commission to intensify its efforts to ensure that an international dispute-settlement procedure is initiated before the WTO .
35.0076	It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry .
152.3368	Finally , as from 18 December , we are , of course , counting on the ` ships arrangement ' being examined at the OECD Group 6 meeting .
27.8407	However , it looks very much as if the goal posts are being moved each time , so that we will never reach the finishing line .
19.3071	As you all know , it will take more than six months to carry out this procedure .
35.3616	When big trusts and their political advocates call for less state interference , what they mean is that the state and its money should be solely at their disposal .
779.6244	But in order to achieve that , so that the process may consolidate the shipbuilding industry and its jobs and calm the fears of the families which depend on it , aid will still be necessary beyond 31 December 2000 , because the market situation is not one of equality , but of unfairness and of dumping .
183.7336	Improving competitiveness of the EU yards is encouraged by the Commission but , in the face of massive price undercutting by Korean yards , the achievable progress in productivity is not sufficient .
3.7808	The Council emphasised that such a support mechanism must not distort competition inside the EU .
874.6615	The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State , according to the latest classification in Nice , which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations .
293.1582	When , by means of the medical dispatch which they distributed in the country where the owner lived - that is , by means of the British press - it was discovered that the illness was serious , instead of changing hospitals , they changed the classification of the hospital .
39.9955	Of course , we await the Commission ' s reply with great interest , in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled .
373.7825	Mr President , I would also like to start by offering my condolences to the family of the murdered councillor and to the Members from the Popular Party , and I wish to reject this fascist barbarity of ETA and of the groups which support it .
147.6775	I also believe that the submarine Tireless should be taken to Great Britain to be repaired as soon as possible , as soon as the weather conditions are suitable .
345.9671	Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directives 89/618/Euratom , on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency , and 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards , apply in relation to the submarine and what steps have been taken accordingly .
20.1799	Under the usual complaints procedure , we are not entitled to make this reply public , although we can say broadly what it says .
2428.2627	There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union ; but , of course , Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom , without passing through any other Member State in the European Union .
15.3079	All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock .
2767.8297	Well , here is an example of one Member State treating public opinion in another Member State just as it would in any other country in the world , just as if , at the end of the day , there were no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European project , just as if European solidarity had made no progress whatsoever .
37.5113	It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat .
50.3977	A debate is taking place there , but the citizens , on the basis of their knowledge or intuition , are turning their attention to the European institutions .
305.0277	Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs .
117.4116	Community competence , however much some people may wish it otherwise , does not extend to the classification of ports to carry out repair work on submarines , questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and requirements on a submarine to be removed for repair elsewhere .
58.6858	If we want to help them even more , we should call on the Community institutions to increase the financial , human and material resources of the UNHCR .
83.7174	I would ask the Commission to re-instate this aid to the UNHCR and also to designate the UNHCR as the coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs .
47.5293	It should therefore have access to civil victims and its teams on the ground should be able to work in complete safety and with all the resources needed to carry out their mission .
514.5928	On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union , which is the final aim fixed in Tampere for the common European asylum system .
274.6368	Finally , I should like to pay a tribute to all the work that has been done by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR and to wish Mr Ruud Lubbers well in his new post .
2156.4470	It seems to us important that we are promoting a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recuperation I mentioned , but it also seems to us very important that we roundly condemn the recurrence of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia , Albania and Kosovo , because that is a worrying reminder of what happened during the Kosovo conflict , where Western powers held responsibilities .
6.0938	Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1 , 2 and 3 .
370.0077	I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti , with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts .
18.8644	I also agree with the request for help from KFOR to thwart further violence in the Presevo valley .
27.7329	I welcome steps now taken by KFOR to tackle the problem and continue to urge restraint on all sides .
28.3954	B5-0916 / 2000 by BarÃ ³ n Crespo and others , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
520.9834	This clause was agreed in the Palacio de la Moneda in March 1990 , and I am well aware of this because I had the privilege of being there when President Alwyn took over , following the vote which put an end to General Pinochet ' s regime .
30.3570	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution , which will , of course , be passed .
48.9988	The international community must exercise its right of democratic vigilance , not in order to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent country but as a precautionary and preventative political procedure .
3.6613	The situation in prisons and police stations is entirely unacceptable and includes extensive abuse and torture .
579.2319	This treatment would be exactly like we see in Western Europe and , faced with the protests , the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout Turkey .
5.2083	Action is needed quickly , which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda .
96.0604	He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France , which he denies .
728.7586	When militants and those in charge of these associations decide to meet in order to celebrate the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , their houses are surrounded by police and anyone trying to enter is harassed in the street by men dressed in civilian clothes .
5.6465	The second problem is actually only part of a pattern of harassment .
37.7629	My Group , like this Parliament , is particularly sensitive about the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world .
1.8936	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us not get carried away , please .
51.5552	The negotiations went extremely well and I am delighted that we are picking up momentum in those negotiations , which I hope will have the conclusion which the honourable Member referred to .
8.2741	Several honourable Members referred to the situation of prisoners in Turkey .
10.1133	B5-0912 / 2000 by Van Hecke , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
3.4035	Mr President , Commissioner , we must not stand by and watch .
17.9826	It was in this context that the military took power , which , as ever , only helped to aggravate the situation .
8.5891	This attitude is descended directly from France ' s imperialist policy .
5.6375	The Commission is also very concerned by the recent violence .
3.4077	The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
67.6863	Unfair competition could help destroy good shipbuilding environments and lead to the loss of know-how and jobs ; in the long term it could result in a monopoly situation , which would not be beneficial to world trade .
25.9070	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
60.3305	I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions , including those made at the amendments stage , and also the committee 's experts , for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution .
989.4564	We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures , such as lifelong learning , which ensure that they have an active lifestyle .
14.2192	Promoting life-long learning - a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is a matter I also support .
222.5753	Needless to say , people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things , but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours .
32.0548	In its monthly report for July 2000 , the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings .
15.0135	In my opinion , it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments .
5.3068	Thanks to her proposals for an active old age , society is enriched by a whole generation .
134.9292	Promises regarding pensions must be kept , but pensions must be secured with those countries ' own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU ' s common monetary policy .
131.5842	Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time , for our human life span has doubled .
1.9699	This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress .
34.5597	They accepted payments - the whole of society was therefore involved - and older workers retired , but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed .
48.3940	Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not .
7.1272	My brother and I joined him there .
60.7362	Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health - and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing .
496.7441	Mr President , I have accepted both Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Pronk , in which he calls for the text to be amended and insists on the concept of development of the population rather than ageing of the population .
7.6360	It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities .
7.8199	Mr President , in principle , the Committee on Budgets backs the Commission proposal too .
24.6290	That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here , and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures .
129.4588	I believe that where marketing , sales and training programmes are concerned , life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more , because it is precisely the new technologies - handling product promotion using modern logistics - which will open up entirely new possibilities .
4.9895	First of all , I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his good report .
291.8252	The fact that there are alternatives is something which Mr Garot showed in his report when , for once , with pigs , we tried to develop a market organisation which was actually designed to benefit farming and safeguard farming structures .
13.4845	No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand , and the latter must not be advertised .
28.2000	Everyone has sufficient food , so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product .
830.9543	It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24 , which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years , so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool .
117.8189	In the Greek text Mrs Jutta Haug is referred to as a male rapporteur and Mr Markus Ferber is referred to as a female rapporteur .
1.9050	Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice .
150.2973	This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being , which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings .
1166.1045	Finally , I would like to extend seasonal greetings to everyone , especially those few who have taken the trouble to attend this last Friday session of the year 2000 in Strasbourg , and to wish you all a good and , above all , wise new century .
362.2576	Mr Prodi has put an emphatic stop to this kind of action , which has hopefully resonated with Mr Moscovici , and I truly hope that this trend can be broken and reversed at the Councils in Nice and Biarritz .
219.1622	These are , as we know , very tricky negotiations and raise fears of a setback or a watered-down agreement in Nice which , as you have already acknowledged , Mr Moscovici , would be even more serious .
6.7186	Any other procedure would mean a huge democratic deficit .
809.9304	Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the European Parliament delegation in the Convention and the President of the Convention , Mr Roman Herzog , for their committed work .
1692.2592	Mr President-in-Office , I would ask you in all seriousness just to consider the following : if you now wish simply to go back to the Cologne Decision and reflect at your leisure on whether this should be incorporated into the Treaties , what encouragement will those who disregard human rights draw from the fact that we are hesitating to do this ?
46.5183	On this issue I would like to indicate , if not my disagreement , then at least some slight differences in opinion on two points .
129.1212	He was quite right to emphasise the distance we have travelled since the fall of the wall and the reunification of Germany ten years ago .
35.7593	She also made an extremely worthwhile suggestion concerning the link between the Charter and discussions over a future Article 7 .
76.9349	This is a feasible undertaking , and the University of Florence ' s study would serve as an excellent basis from which to start work .
13.6075	In saying this , Mr Moscovici , I have no intention of giving the Community total control .
24.6225	Now , however , we are seeing that President Putin is pursuing a policy of openness towards the West .
3181.2137	Report -LRB- A5-0235 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Skinner , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission communication `` Risk capital : Implementation of the action plan - Proposals for moving forward '' -LSB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 493 - C5-0320 / 1999 - 1999/2208 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB-
8.2709	Is this not a case of double standards ?
34.7456	Piecyk recommendation for second reading -LRB- A5-0232 / 2000 -RRB-
31.1555	At the same time , introducing larger buses would make it possible to reduce the number of buses on the road , thereby reducing damage to the environment .
1.7496	To risk personal capital , in particular , is a highly precarious business .
5.6997	In reality , they often have more in common with gamblers who hope to tap into goldmines .
63.7099	It is quite specific , on the other hand , regarding the right to property and freedom to conduct a business , affecting primarily the capital-owning minority , the right to exercise this and to abuse it .
368.9011	Mr President , I abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union because I consider that this Charter is still extremely unsatisfactory , despite some progress .
1929.1325	As a member of the European Parliament delegation to this body , having worked , together with my fellow members , on the matter for eight months , I must say that the Charter of Fundamental Rights could well , in fact , have represented an added value for Europe but that , as things stand at present , we can derive no satisfaction from either its content or the working methods which governed its drafting .
78.2755	The CSU 's Europe group supports the horizontal provision which makes it clear that no new powers are being established for the Community or the Union .
114.6310	Because we think that the process of European integration warrants a genuine democratic public debate , there can be no political construction of Europe without social rights or democracy .
9.3786	That concludes the vote .
318.9798	-LRB- A5-0249 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Poos on Cyprus -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 502 - C5-0025 / 2000 - 1997/2171 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RRB- ;
7.7835	I am convinced that some countries will be in a position to prepare themselves adequately within that time .
281.6523	The French Presidency will immediately inform the committee which you chair , Mr Brok , of the result of these negotiations , come Tuesday afternoon , according to the tradition that has developed between us .
404.5807	We in fact expect , in absolute agreement with Commissioner Verheugen , to enter into negotiations on 42 new chapters , i.e. between 4 and 9 according to country , just like the Portuguese Presidency before us .
565.6390	The date of 1 January 2003 , which is the only one on which the European Union has agreed , is , however , both for the candidates and for ourselves , an extremely ambitious objective and this is the deadline to which the Presidency will be working .
28.1850	I am quite ready , of course , to follow the very important debate we are all involved in here today .
56.4348	The present and largest enlargement round in the history of European unification is a morally-imperative , strategically-needed and politically-feasible move .
34.6636	When we see that the countries in the enlargement process have already stabilised their democratic systems in a short space of time , then that is their achievement .
53.8653	They are also intended to help the EU institutions monitor their success and to act as a basis on which negotiating strategies can be further developed .
127.6460	In preparation for this , the Commission is working on a new monitoring system which will allow us to assess the state of progress in negotiations and actual implementation in each country accurately at any given time .
360.7091	Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are debating Mr Brok ' s report on the progress made on the European Union ' s enlargement process , an annually recurring theme .
19.2416	An essential part of the report is Paragraph 25 and the amendment which my group tabled in relation to it .
20.9294	Mr President , Mr Brok 's report is an excellent description of the European Parliament 's position .
557.9837	The challenge of reunification , even more perhaps than that of enlargement is so great that it suffuses and surrounds every debate in this House : this is why there is such depth and intensity to all our debates , including this morning 's debate on our own need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge .
35.3233	The critical thing is not to allow frustration to grow among the candidates - that they are always in the anteroom but never quite in the chamber .
261.6407	Our group believes that it is quite possible , if we are so determined , to include the first group of applicant countries already in the next European parliamentary elections , if there is determination on both sides to do so .
27.7208	Our disagreements with a portion of Mr Brok ' s report range from points of detail to others of greater importance .
3.3053	On all these subjects , the Brok report confines itself to discussing adaptation and reform .
305.0211	Unmistakably , the personal commitment of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the productive exchange of ideas in those circles , point in the same direction .
1.6868	Enlargement , as I have just said , is a historic process , a duty .
13.5606	The European Union ' s credibility is implicated in this .
54.2507	Let us create the conditions for success , for it is important that this enlargement is not a flash in the pan , not just a symbolic decision that will go on to create problems .
686.4245	None of you should be surprised if the negotiators , prime ministers , speakers and members of your national parliaments complain that it is all taking too long - apart from the fact that it is a favourite pastime in Europe - everything takes far too long with the Commission , I know all about that !
281.5610	If we do not set a date , we may cause disappointment ; if we set too early a date , a certain complacency may creep in ; in other words , we shall address the question of dates when the time is right , i.e. if we can say when a country is ready for accession and when it is not with a sufficient degree of certainty .
5.7972	We have already done this to the widest extent .
56.6550	Before I was born , freedom and democracy had triumphed over oppression and the insanity of war , and a European Union was being formed .
18.0125	They possess a rich source of culture , diversity and potential which the united Europe can not do without .
72.4279	If it completes the negotiations effectively and purposefully , Estonia has a good chance of becoming one of the Union ' s new Member States .
161.9540	The critical comments and the proposals in my report for urgently needed progress in administrative and social reform are designed to bring Latvia quickly and successfully into the European Union .
9.1918	It is our job to continue to support Latvia with the integration of the Russian population .
126.5260	The fact that the Lithuanian currency is still pegged to the dollar is also important here , because as the dollar rises , so too does the value of the litas against the euro .
3.5360	That is the only way of giving Kaliningrad a chance to improve its development potential .
47.6020	Many of us feel that it would have been a good idea to specify the dates for accession in order to encourage the countries and give them a sense of our continuing support .
84.9689	One problem specific to the Czech Republic , especially on the German-Czech border , is the problem of prostitution , especially child prostitution .
5.6413	We are in the middle of the negotiating process .
8.0476	The problems I mentioned are not insurmountable .
5.5344	These policies must lead to the free and unforced assimilation of individuals belonging to the gypsy community .
88.9220	The current resolution and report focus on certain of the more controversial issues , namely nuclear safety , border controls , the treatment of minorities and the question of corruption .
165.2612	Perhaps it is no coincidence that those same public polls show that the European Union Ambassador is the second most popular person in Romania today .
628.4476	Mr President , Commissioner , your rapporteur endorses the contents of the Commission ' s report on Slovenia and notes that the criticisms expressed in 1998 gave the Slovenian authorities a salutary shock , prompting them to speed up adoption of the measures necessary for accession to take place .
48.4120	Perpetuation of the status quo following the Turkish invasion of July-August 1974 is not acceptable to the European Union .
343.2297	It was only logical for the European Council in Helsinki in December last year to give the green light for the resumption of accession negotiations with Malta when the accession negotiations were extended .
863.9051	The tendency in the report on Poland , encouraging its politicians to speed up the harmonisation of its legislation with the EU and implement the acquis , and the successful conclusion of the agreement on the liberalisation of Polish agricultural trade a few days ago are positive signals here .
6.1884	He has the express support of our committee there .
6.4857	Allow me to comment on a few focal points .
10.3256	Hence , if we are to be honest , we can not keep setting up new hurdles in these areas .
224.3431	But one thing is certain : the remarkable efforts and absolute determination of the candidate countries to join the European Union must be incentive enough for us to get ready and able to enlarge .
130.7040	Mr President , we might be inclined to think that when new countries join the EU , this automatically means that they will have to introduce more stringent rules to protect the environment and nature .
6.8578	. Mr President , when Pandora opened her box all the ills of mankind were released .
335.4711	That is why my report devotes a lot of its recommendations to the need to encourage the Phare programme to do more in the health field and to bring the countries into partnership now in the health action programmes and other areas .
8.6550	We must begin to discuss this integrated and polycentric European development .
5.2145	We have just heard something about the `` carrot '' in the regional policy and promotion sector .
8.8307	There is a series of further points which the Regional Committee has mentioned in its report .
87.3212	If we are not to risk a repeat performance in the candidate countries , it is crucial that we be clear about the fact that enlargement should not be of benefit only to men but also be of benefit to women .
219.5406	I have already warned colleagues in Central Europe about this ; when the tone sobers down , then this is only proof that we are moving from the honeymoon period into a life of domestic normality within Europe .
115.1069	As a result of the Intergovernmental Conference , the conditions needed in order for the European Union to be able to enlarge will be in place .
769.3430	The group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for negotiations with the first group of countries to be completed by the end of 2002 , so that the first accessions can take place before the next European elections in 2004 .
8.4928	The various reports reflect this mainstream attitude .
28.3339	Now that you have just emerged from your former prison , do not rush to enter a new one .
160.0130	I think specifically that in going too quickly to six then to fifteen we have displayed our inability to build a Europe which respects the disparities between its initial members .
10.3905	We shall obtain increased competition and a more rapid process of reform in Western Europe too .
798.6799	However , at various different stages , always during or immediately following the Second World War , measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the Copenhagen criteria , given the prevailing spirit at the time , and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period , including the peace treaties , was founded on precisely those laws .
416.7535	It is for these reasons and , more importantly , because of our own experience in Greece , that our opposition to the enlargement of the European Union is meant as an expression of brotherly solidarity to the workers and people in general in the candidate countries .
139.1028	It is imperative that the accession negotiations between Romania and the Union detail exactly what the Romanian Government needs to do to improve the standard and quality of orphanages in that country .
489.5405	In Mr Gawronski ' s report , the Commission is urged , by the rapporteur among others , to examine measures for furthering development and for strengthening the synergy between Poland , Lithuania and the Russian region of Kaliningrad .
363.6300	Commissioner Verheugen , as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I took advantage of the opportunity to visit the countries that want to accede to the European Union .
194.4475	The Poos report notes that the State operates smoothly , respect for human rights and freedoms form the cornerstone of the social and cultural tradition of the island and the country ' s social structures are , first and foremost , humane structures .
9.3336	The audiovisual sector is very important .
456.2089	Mr President , today ' s debate concerns the major challenge at the turn of the millennium : to unite Europe in order to create peace and security , together with social , economic and environmental development .
74.9550	Mr President , as a member of the Lithuanian delegation I would like to support the remarks made by Mrs Hoff in her report .
12.2317	Blatant discrimination occurs in other countries such as Poland and Malta .
560.6527	It is a process that is having very mixed success , but it still inspires great hope , because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the Union in the future , and will therefore be called upon , in a special way , to establish ties with their homeland , where their forefathers come from .
95.4021	Put aside any thoughts of replacing the principle of ` Each according to his/her merits ' with that of ` Each according to his/her merits , but not until my elections are over ' .
50.1188	Its cooperation with the international community during the Kosovo conflict , and its balanced role at that time , are of great importance for the whole region .
4.7546	It follows from this though , that there must also be privatisation and restructuring of the economy .
11.3522	The ignorant and the excluded can not make up the information society : they are a sure sign of its failure .
10.1785	Member States could do more in their twinning arrangements to assist the applicant countries in developing their administrative capacity .
4.4930	If any area of Europe is ready , they are , especially Cyprus .
249.1505	It has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically , but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in Europe .
61.8490	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we can not afford to underestimate the importance and potential implications of this historic opportunity to unite our continent and live in peace .
15.7233	And , in addition , we really must see to it at the same time that the proper administrative practices are in place .
338.3098	As Vice-President of our joint parliamentary committee with the Czech Republic , I can vouch for the fact that this is true of the Czech Republic , but I assume the same applies to a number of other States too .
790.0829	The fact that there has been a reunited Germany in the European Union for ten years now , bears witness to the solidarity between us . Other countries should now be given the chance to share in this , even though enlargement is not just about solidarity .
9.1675	On the other hand , a slow pace is also an obvious problem , leaving the candidate countries frustrated .
1476.5444	After two horrific world wars and fifty years of Communist oppression and dictatorship when - in the name of an oppressive class struggle - democracy , religious freedom , the environment and our Christian and universal dignity as human beings were trampled on , it is now finally time to unite our continent and our part of the world .
320.3399	It should be made clear to all countries that accession to the European Union is not quite the same thing as accession to the Economic and Monetary Union and to the euro zone , and that there are different deadlines .
385.6802	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in his policy statement yesterday , Mr Prodi , the President of the Commission , said that whoever weakened any institution of the European Union weakened the Union as a whole .
1203.2199	Mr President , this very day we are going to enthusiastically approve - and with great interest in my case - the reports on enlargement involving candidate countries such as the Czech Republic , which is the subject of Mr JÃ 1/4 rgen SchrÃ ¶ der ' s report .
76.3584	In my opinion , and I say it in the presence of a former attorney-general of Ireland , the Commission has not yet shown sufficient resoluteness in pursuing this matter .
6310.8716	-LRB- A5-0257 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Paulsen , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 654 - C5-0344 / 1999 - 1999/0259 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RRB-
5.1768	This is a crucial and important point in preventive work .
94.4389	The people of Europe can not , however , properly rely upon such control ' s really being carried out if there are major differences of approach between Member States and regions .
28.4268	As I personally am not prepared to sacrifice food safety on the altar of the agri-food lobbies , I have withdrawn my name from the report .
288.6565	When setting maximum values , we must remember that nature has its own set of laws , that harvests vary from year to year and that farmers are ultimately harmed by environmental effects over which they have no control .
3.6170	We dealt in exactly the same way with all other matters relating to the blending ban .
14.4128	This directive is the first link in a long series of decisions to be taken on food safety .
19.7029	Zero risk is , of course , impossible , but an early warning system must nevertheless be put in place .
5.0688	We do not oppose the Paulsen report - we fully support it .
1409.8037	The Commissioner will know that in my country the Independent Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs was worried that such a ban may actually drive out blending-down procedures into the world outside the EU where they are less likely to be correctly monitored and controlled for any future entry into the Union .
327.8678	I am pleased that the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats have withdrawn the amendments concerning the problems associated with dilution .
123.8903	In the domain of EU consumer policy , I believe ` from stable to table ' has few rival claimants to the title of Expression of the Year .
9.3499	Unfortunately , however , despite all our efforts , it will never be possible to completely eradicate criminal practices .
30.2488	Mr President , this directive forms part of the consistent set of measures which is planned actively to render all stages of the food chain safe .
0.2355	If hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended .
391.2279	Secondly , the Commission can not agree to Amendment No 27 , in which Parliament proposes to delete the possibility of defining acceptability criteria for feed materials which have undergone certain decontamination procedures .
32.3543	Amendments Nos 39 and 40 , proposing to delete the possibility of establishing an action threshold are similarly unacceptable .
44.1066	The Commission can not accept Amendments Nos 5 and 22 on the rapid alert system as they are currently worded .
5155.8348	The next item is the debate on the report -LRB- A5-0233 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedstuffs -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 744 - C5-0020 / 2000 - 2000/0015 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RRB- .
15.6696	Commissioner Byrne , we are highly satisfied .
89.3474	This obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request , and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the Member States .
6.2426	The question of genetically modified cereals should be regulated elsewhere .
7.2745	The standards are scarcely comparable , let alone transferable .
16.6069	This is a simple thing , but for ten years , we have sat and twiddled our thumbs .
55.1782	I take a more critical view , however , of the escape clause which would give the Commission the scope to take measures of its own without consulting the Member States .
25.8553	A second , necessary step in this process is to have exact data at one ' s disposal .
77.6352	In the Council , a very substantial majority of Member States is opposed to the introduction of an obligation to systematically indicate on labels the precise composition of the compound feedingstuffs intended for productive livestock .
6.7353	Madam President , unfortunately I have to inform you and the House of a new tragedy at sea .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
5751.3629	The recital would therefore read as follows : `` recital c -RRB- whereas insufficient attention continues to be paid to the situation of the Roma , whereas discrimination against the Roma must be tackled seriously by the Hungarian Government through the adoption of a set of positive measures that may lead to the free assimilation of the individuals belonging to this community , whereas it should be possible to find a solution given that a Minorities Office has been set up and medium-term legislation has been passed which will help them to become integrated into Hungarian society , '' .
167.1266	Mr President , I should just like to clarify the point that there is no longer a recital A but , by agreement with Mr Martelli , a new Paragraph 1 .
480.3568	I voted against the Brok report on the enlargement of the European Union , because whilst it may be very clear-sighted in technical terms , it is nevertheless prompted by mistaken political ideas about the future of Europe .
393.7237	Extending the European Union , at least in the first stage , to more than 100 million new citizens , will provide new impetus for the development and integration of the European economy as a whole .
39.3921	His report clearly sets out the issues and the objectives of enlargement in the field of regional policy and he does so in both political as well as financial terms .
38.9965	Each enlargement has required long-term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements , often lasting for several years .
464.4572	We must respond in an appropriate way to this enlargement which will considerably increase the number of poorer regions , and think carefully together about the risk of accentuating imbalances in Europe , in order to ensure that Europe does not become one huge heterogeneous mass .
8.9438	So where is the ` progress ' for the populations of these countries who have never been consulted ?
423.7646	I even fear that this collection of country reports and comparative reports will prove counterproductive , particularly in the countries that have applied for membership of the European Union , and more especially in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
537.8673	When I look at what has been done so far to that end at the Intergovernmental Conference , I feel that we have little cause for pride and that we should put our own house in order before imposing prior conditions on the applicant countries , especially when we ourselves have been unable to satisfy these conditions .
449.3498	This is why I and my fellow Members of the European Parliament from the Front National would like to spare the nations of Eastern Europe the mistake of being ` disintegrated ' within the American-European Union .
108.6363	We must henceforth seek out new types of measures and new tools to benefit all the areas which are lacking in infrastructures and service networks such as , for example , the south of Italy .
138.6806	It is to be hoped that the governments of the applicant countries will continue strengthening their administrative capacity so that the EU ' s acquis communautaire can be implemented in these countries prior to accession .
360.5358	And it is this feeling - or lack thereof - much more than meticulous analyses of the accounts , which should , when the time comes , govern our choices regarding enlargement as European integration ceases to have any meaning if it is no longer primarily political .
600.4133	I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Poland , some of which belong to a Pensioners ' Party which is similar to the Pensioners ' Party which I represent in the European Union .
1394.5467	Restructuring of the agricultural sector would appear to be necessary in a country where the rural population represents 38 % of the total population and accounts for 4.9 % of the GDP , and where agricultural employment is estimated at 27.4 % compared with 5 % within the European Union .
2815.4296	Mr President , I am delighted that the House has adopted Mr SchrÃ ¶ der ' s excellent report by a majority of more than 90 % and that , for the second year in succession , we have made an issue of the Benes decrees , which infringe international law and human rights , as well as highlighting their inconsistency with Community law and practice and with the Copenhagen criteria .
89.8902	As Mr Wiersma said in his report , I would stress the progress made in the Slovakian Republic in the area of the protection of minorities .
23.6277	Van Orden Report -LRB- A5-0241 / 2000 -RRB-
94.8817	. I welcome the Winterbourne report on Romania 's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws .
303.5193	On the contrary , I am keen to see Cyprus in , but I could not accept this unbalanced report , especially paragraph 4 , and the failure to insist on at least on the desirability of having a political settlement prior to accession .
96.7217	As Mr de Soto noted , we do not expect progress to be easy , and the success of the UN process is far from assured .
17.2693	It is essential to initiate projects involving both communities and to encourage dialogue between both parts in a new spirit of trust .
82.5778	From the economic point of view , the accession of Cyprus should not pose major problems , since it is a country with a market economy and a high standard of living .
87.7356	Mr President , the wholesomeness of feed materials and feedingstuffs is , of course , very important to the Pensioners ' Party , and so I voted for the Paulsen report .
24.8275	We have the example of the thousands of litres of dioxin-contaminated milk which could be legally watered down with quantities of healthy milk .
10.9792	We must continue to condemn human rights abuses in Burma .
151.4962	For those of us comfortable and secure enough to fashion our own working and social environment , we can only begin to imagine the appalling , and sometimes life-threatening , discrimination which people face daily .
49.2940	Imagine the world through the eyes of a child growing up in a world which discriminates against it because it is female , a member of an ethnic minority , disabled or a lesbian .
10.6376	Job applicants who come from socially disadvantaged families or urban backgrounds or who are disabled are often not accepted .
7.8397	They see the danger of having to hire people who do not identify with their values and convictions .
31.2618	She tried to get into a restaurant to have a meal and was refused entry on the grounds that her physical appearance would put other diners off .
362.9082	We in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs have always argued that this fragmented approach gives the wrong political signal , as if there might be some sort of hierarchy in discrimination .
5.0850	The fight against discrimination is something which concerns us all .
92.7129	This Parliament will send a clear message in our vote to all our citizens that we intend to improve Member States ' record in ensuring respect for equal treatment , irrespective of age , race , disability and sexual orientation .
4.5850	If this is a sign of what is to come , I hope he does many more .
20.3205	I would also like to congratulate Mr Mann on the results of his work on the present report .
76.1457	The fact remains that the report tabled by our fellow Member , Mr Cashman contains many good things , particularly the space accorded to NGOs .
629.8819	We were also right to decide against including sex discrimination in this directive because there is already a separate European directive on sex discrimination , which will , in fact , be revised further to the Commission proposals and which is founded on a much stronger legal basis , about which Parliament , in fact , may decide in codecision .
1.8532	The Community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented .
49.8811	Ladies and gentlemen , I would remind you that whenever prohibition has been applied in Europe it has been necessary to take a step backwards .
87.0180	The President of Italy addressed this House today and I was interested when he said that it was not the aim of this Union to negate national values .
95.0258	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this week is an important week as far as the debates in this House are concerned .
210.0679	This means that , for the first time , a different line is being adopted : we are not doling out funding left , right and centre but evaluating the quality of the operations and insisting on high quality ; the operations themselves must then be monitored and their results published .
77.4134	For that reason we shall be supporting Amendment No 18 to the Mann report which calls for Member States to repeal all penal code provisions discriminating against homosexuals .
11.4042	There are many examples of this in France .
55.3364	And the national laws in our 15 countries also practice discrimination , including the Socialist France of the Socialist Mr Jospin .
406.5860	Mr President , the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation extends the ban on discrimination beyond reasons of race or ethnic origin to other reasons which are used as a motivation for discrimination and which are mentioned in Article 13 .
5864.8937	Mr President , Commissioner , part of the debate proves that we , in fact , need a directive , because if people claim here that Europe is meddling in a centralist manner in an area which should fall under the remit of the Member States , knowing what has happened in many countries of Europe - even yesterday on television , there was again a whole raft of reports of attacks on Jewish synagogues , a report on the rape of a woman of foreign origin etc - they must have some nerve claiming that Europe does not need a directive on anti-discrimination .
21.0646	Two more messages .
45.3470	I therefore consider that it is necessary to commit the public and private sectors to this task and , to this end , I believe that the public sector must provide an example .
576.5041	Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam threw up a challenge for the European Union agenda , which gave the Community specific powers to initiate a variety of actions to combat discrimination , so as to ensure the same level of protection for all disadvantaged groups .
9923.4644	We must support Amendment No 37 by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which also exempts any restrictions on the religion or faith of persons who come directly into contact with members of that faith in education , social welfare or health care , for example , teachers in denominational schools , doctors and nurses in hospitals and hospices , visitors to inmates in prison , counsellors and carers for children , old people , teenagers and married couples , where these socially desirable services are provided by religious bodies .
64.9501	I congratulate the rapporteur on this and , in conclusion , I shall vote in favour of these reports , with the exception of the point I raised just now .
56.5344	Mr President , Commissioner , what we are now in the process of doing is translating Article 13 of the Treaty into practical politics .
22.5822	I would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and cooperation in getting a coordinated view in such a short time .
15.7501	There are three categories of amendment .
11.5514	The Commission is ready to simplify the wording of Article 5 for better understanding of this provision .
48.3155	We all know that this is very important , but I must stress that in some Member States the collection of this kind of data infringes constitutional provisions on the protection of privacy .
87.9057	I had to reply to more than 50 different points and amendments and I am very optimistic that these amendments will be adopted during the French presidency .
36.5621	You can not claim to respect democracy and human rights if you do not act to stop weapons of murder and repression falling into the wrong hands .
9.3171	It is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers .
134.0405	In this sense , the Titley report is particularly efficient and highlights not only the merits but also the omissions , the innate limitations of the Council 's report and of the feasibility of implementing the code of conduct .
38.5305	We continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date , in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry .
62.0051	Mr President , its undeniable merits notwithstanding , the report is very technical and sticks to the paradigm and framework of military security , and it lends disproportionate weight to considerations relating to the defence industry .
75.2894	On the basis of this consideration , I would argue in favour of clarity : which criterion prevails in the event of the criteria quoted by Mr Titley clashing ?
39.8529	The code has already increased mutual understanding of Member States ' policies , it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and it has encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions .
7.5237	A number of projects are currently in progress or under consideration .
121.1011	By means of its Resolution of 18 May 2000 , this Parliament lent its firm support to this project , which is now being put into action .
90.1868	These proposals will become part of a series of specific Communications , each of which represents a contribution to the establishment of a European Research Area .
7.1208	It has an important role to play .
14.3896	Commissioner , I would like to draw your attention to a very long-standing issue for whoever has been involved in research .
8.5490	There are new proposals to champion .
692.3651	I would , however , like to say before Parliament that it is important for this need , which has been expressed and which is , moreover , a force for economic development and innovation in this area , to be considered at the level of the MEDA programmes and at that of all the external relations programmes .
961.8602	If I am unable to give you an immediate reply on this today , it is because it was precisely my intention , in this policy paper , to invite the Member States to adopt a position , for there will never be a European Research Area if it stems solely from the will of the Commission .
28.5225	As regards the ECSC programme , you will be aware that an agreement has been reached , and that research will continue .
2214.6586	I have to report not only to the Court of Auditors and to the tax-payers , but also , first and foremost , to the European Parliament , which is responsible for budgetary control and for adopting this budget , and I believe that it is my duty and role to say what is happening , at such times as I judge fit , and to do so in a transparent manner , with respect for the budgetary authority of which the European Parliament forms part .
15.9040	I think the ball is in your court : your staff have the details , but they must be allowed to provide an answer .
59.7633	I believe that negotiations are in progress on 83 of the 102 SPDs to be signed , although I am only speaking from memory .
1742.8548	As the honourable Member pointed out , the duty on fuel and diesel used as motor fuel which applies in the United Kingdom is the highest in Europe , but duties on fuel oil and kerosene , at least if - and insofar as - these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or even for heating , remain far below the highest values applicable within the Union , as is also the case with the duty on heavy fuel oil .
24.7234	Therefore once again , the Commission has no instruments to get Member States to change the level of excise taxes .
6.3077	The logic of economic reasoning supports the statement made by Mr Martin .
236.1557	However , if he comes to me with a particular case in point , a particular region , or whatever if may be , then I would be happy to raise the matter with my colleague , Mr Barnier .
11.4262	Dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward , but we must be able to prepare these minorities .
1.8211	For a wide range of sectors this means the reduction and phasing out of activities .
171.1223	What would you think if , during its Presidency , the Swedish Government demonstrated this power by taking action to reinstate economic support for ECPAT Sweden ?
121.1997	To withdraw support for this work would therefore be to go both against the Council ' s and Parliament ' s demand for priority to be given to the fight against the child sex trade .
3.8898	I would like to thank the Commissioner , who spoke succinctly yet unequivocally on the issue .
3.5615	The provisions are extremely comprehensive and touch upon various rules affecting hunting .
102.1032	I should like a guarantee from the Commission that under absolutely no circumstances will the rules in this document apply to meat consumed by people for their own household needs .
133.0011	I will present a report on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport to the Council and to the European Parliament .
41.8919	. As I indicated , the Commission is currently working on a report on the operation of an animal transport directive in the Member States .
16.7121	The criteria are currently under discussion .
27.9822	Concerning these aspects , the Commission has already prepared a mandate for the standardisation bodies to draft standards on the use of computers over long periods .
15.5582	As the author is not present , Question No 12 lapses .
113.1453	It has to be said that if we avoided any political contact at all with governments or regimes whose human rights record we profoundly disapproved of , there would be a lot less foreign travel by governments and heads of government .
18.2400	Aung San Suu Kyi has long pressed for such a dialogue .
1.5686	In those circumstances it may well be that a mission would be justifiable .
151.5026	EU Member States provide the bulk of the OSCE budget , and the European Commission has also provided EUR 5 million for equipment for the registration process .
0.7236	I happened to be there together with 200 other election observers from 52 countries .
19.1152	Mr President , I congratulate Mr Titley on his report , as others have done earlier today .
15.8983	Mr President , the European defence industry is important , but at least as important is world peace .
50.3352	If you look at the other countries in Europe which are now getting involved in the arms industry it is extremely disturbing .
50.6428	The arms trade is characterised by the fact that the major purchasers are poor countries , which seem to be able to find the money for arms but not for anything else .
296.6833	In its first report the Committee of Independent Experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate - even conflicting - activities , which do not belong in the same department .
32.0573	Secondly , the Commission 's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions .
461.1686	Parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forwarded to Parliament soon I also understand the Commission 's wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight .
65.5663	Also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently , admittedly in a decentralised manner , but certainly not under the Director-General of the Directorate-General under scrutiny .
161.3667	Today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this House to take a rather sceptical view of the European Commission ' s reform process .
347.1533	I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussions on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee ' s authority during the further reform process .
18.3685	Unlike the internal audit , the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made .
351.5649	There has also been a certain carelessness , of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note , so that we will , as soon as possible , achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report .
1201.6389	I want to thank both committees - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs , Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell ' Alba , who was unable to be here today .
16.2881	I really find this proposal so useful that I am only sorry I did not think of it myself .
272.0890	Clearly , we can not attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minors in that , under the principle of subsidiarity , each Member State is sovereign in this matter , but also because cultural and moral concepts and therefore views on these issues differ widely from country to country : for example , there are differences in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence , etc .
59.3113	I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones .
69.7473	But we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems , that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility .
358.6778	Allow me finally to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is also concerned about the increase in the number of TV programmes containing sex and violence .
297.7903	So all those concerned , starting with the children , via the parents , the teachers , the countries , the European Union and , beyond them , the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects .
136.8256	There is no question of simplifying matters or engaging in generalisations , even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the European Parliament , but there are a great many examples .
0.2128	Subsidiarity must serve some purpose , however , and not act as a screen .
97.5309	The objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principles of self-regulation , and my officials have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the Member States .
645.5496	No-one has more respect than I for Mrs Reding and her Commission staff so I am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular points that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement .
5.2920	This is why the category of researchers should be included , Mr Evans .
4.2523	I believe that the European Commission was wrong to exclude them .
77.7942	I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility .
145.4460	Despite several opinions from the courts , recommendations from Commissioners and actions at Council level , nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the Italian education minister .
166.3252	Mrs Reding , Mr Busquin and his Directorate-General are not doing anything about the training of researchers , nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors ' training .
130.6270	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those , in the relevant committee and in this Chamber , who have committed themselves to making mobility a reality .
172.7770	Our Heads of State and of Government and the regional and national governments have realised that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social sides of the European Union .
4.3947	Mr President , it is my great honour to welcome you to the European Parliament .
50.9455	We are once again deciding the fate of our continent , in a similar way to the great statesmen of the 1950s .
328.3802	The concerns generated by the current value of the euro are well-founded , but it must be remembered that all major currencies have , at one time or another , been subject to massive swings in their daily quotation on the markets .
651.9785	if I had known something useful for my family that was not so for my nation , I would have sought to forget it ; if I had known something useful for my country that would have been prejudicial for Europe , or which would have been useful to Europe but prejudicial for the human race , I would have rejected it as a crime . '
1.7162	This emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women .
0.4532	The second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life .
182.5586	First of all , the guidelines for employment , this time fleshed out with quantified targets , which propose to increase the employment rate for women to 60 % by 2010 .
65.8118	Civil society ' s expectations are high , and this has not escaped the members of the Convention , who are anxious to have a gender-correct Charter .
57.2741	They have a much smaller share in the labour market than men , a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries , especially in southern Europe .
9.4841	I am a man in an EU within which men and women do not have equal opportunities .
1.5827	Perhaps this issue of gender needs to be pointed out in this Assembly .
110.4653	Reference was also made here several times to mainstreaming , and I can only agree with what has been said here that , for example , in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective .
0.6692	Nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
58.4274	It is really very annoying that these women , from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts , are rejecting the radiant future of the euro .
6.5752	The present report , however , puts forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality .
92.3194	Human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to God , their Creator , on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other .
29.8955	That was three years ago .
29.4569	The European Parliament employs 30 % women , which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions .
4.6467	In practically every sphere of activity , serious inequalities still exist .
14.0385	Thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality .
103.4323	Women are forced into temporary work , they are far more exposed to insecure jobs and unemployment , and on average they are paid 30 % less than men .
65.4819	We therefore need to assess the real situation of women , we need to draw up indicators and we need to make our political action binding , so that progress really reaches everyone and not just a few .
1098.6963	Obviously not , and as someone involved with associations for social change - because I too , like many of you , have some thirty years of involvement with these associations behind me - I know how hard the social movement , the feminist movement and the intellectual movement , naturally , have worked to move this issue forward , and today we take our places in roles of responsibility in our institutions .
2.8058	I have not lost hope , however , of improving the text .
25.1931	I fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by Members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report .
58.0715	Mr President , Commissioner , this morning we will approve the Council common position definitively adopting this reform of the Community Customs Code .
259.6756	Finally , Amendment No 11 requested that this modification to the Community Customs Code enter into force before 1 January 2000 and is , therefore , no longer valid .
26.6861	I think that , once again , the conciliation procedure , which means agreement between the institutions , is working properly .
163.8601	After all , in the Community Customs Code , a successful attempt has been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , which surely must always be the objective .
152.8770	Taking into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now finds itself , I am of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure , assuming that the debate were extended , would have been quite uncertain .
8647.1374	Mr President , on that last vote , I would just like to inform the House that the Commission issued a press release yesterday and Commissioner Reding spoke last night to the effect that , as regards the report we have just passed and agreed on mobility for teachers , students , academics , others involved in education , and helping them to move around Europe to study , to work and everything else related to the education field , the Commission will not accept the amendments which ask them to do something to enforce these arrangements .
28.5652	Mr President , this is on a mistake in translation too , though not as important as the one just mentioned .
894.0933	We Independents therefore support - above all , in the interests of enabling the Internal Market to function successfully - the demand of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , for the Commission to draft a legislative proposal concerning the place in which the customs debt was incurred .
31.6580	While this proposal is a step in the right direction it still contains a number of gaps which the Evans report remedies .
157.0929	- -LRB- SV -RRB- While in principle we adopt a positive view of the European Parliament and the Council ' s recommendation on mobility within the Community , we would like to state the following :
208.6222	The Association Agreements concluded between the European Union and the candidate countries , and those which have yet to be concluded , should incorporate regulations banning discrimination against groups protected under Article 13 .
495.9693	Thus , the usual principles of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination , with the European Parliament and Commission only too happy to join in and poke their noses into every national law .
46.0309	I felt it was essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty .
551.5910	Moreover the SNP sees this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlying objectives of the European Union in recognising that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assists the EU 's aims of permitting the free movement of its citizens .
6.8656	The authorities already have their work cut out .
1.5525	This is a very complex area and the proposals are far-reaching and ambitious .
358.3062	They also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God , the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice , forcing such believers to employ those who propagate and practise acts of sex totally against the scriptural ethics .
2.8943	This view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation .
110.4592	Even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the European production and export of arms politically , we are sceptical about the Titley report , mainly for the following reasons .
482.6167	support this report from my colleague , Gary Titley , and agree with him that responsible arms trade practices form part of the `` acquis communautaire '' and therefore candidate countries should be actively involved in the further development of the Code of Conduct on arms exports and that this should be legally binding .
53.8480	The European states have sold arms to Indonesia , whose army is implicated in the massacres in Timor and the Moluccas .
131.3607	Once again , the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children , i.e. the members of tomorrow ' s society , are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive .
10.1208	Minors are different from adults .
127.7055	I will be working closely at national European level to ensure that EU governments implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanisms which I have addressed .
22.0405	The 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women .
223.9160	Equal opportunities at work , equal social participation , equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policies offensive to human dignity as a whole , without equal social prospects , in a society of unemployment and underemployment , with no welfare state , a society in which human values are costed and commercialised .
1180.5609	B5-0784 / 2000 , by Mr Salafranca SÃ ¡ nchez-Neyra , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party -LRB- Christian Democrats -RRB- and European Democrats , on the crisis in Peru ;
360.2366	The adverse effect that North American backing for him has had on those desires must be neutralised by another influence , a positive influence in favour of human rights and full democratic progress , coming from the European Union .
2.8374	The European Union has got to do something and do it quickly .
183.0281	The Commission , in tandem with the Member States , is currently examining how we can best help , in practical terms , in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections , and , if need be , as observers of the process .
1633.9851	As the resolution states , the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on Afghanistan ' s large neighbour , Pakistan , as a means of trying to influence the situation in Afghanistan , I would also add the other large neighbour , the People ' s Republic of China , with which Pakistan has excellent relations and collaborates at military and nuclear level .
12.3170	That is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups , which I have the honour of defending here .
373.1842	It would do the EU ' s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations , with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Afghanistan .
66.4311	The urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by Parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives .
258.6302	It remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of Jihad conspirator , Osama bin Laden .
12.3043	Human rights
37.5989	At the moment , for example , there is a Colombian priest , Oliveiro Medina , who is in Brazil .
177.6091	In this context , I would emphasise that the Commission supports President Pastrana ' s efforts to secure peace and will do everything in its power to promote lasting peace in Colombia .
1197.7861	Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government , and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia , on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities , in particular the Albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue .
12.9759	This outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill , which was adopted by the majority in Parliament .
36.0091	Mr President , I would like to echo Mr Lagendijk ' s praise of Mr Van der Stoel .
544.9942	Mr President , General De Gaulle spoke of the `` paix des braves '' i.e. the peace of the brave , in the era of Franco-German reconciliation , by which he meant that patriots on both sides had been able to achieve a lasting settlement .
118.3666	The funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the PHARE administration committee .
29.6343	What amazes me is that the Government and the company both insist that the Express Samina complied with all the safety requirements .
27.6001	Mr Papoutsis has already `` dismantled '' a very important directorate in his ministry , the Directorate of Merchant Ship Surveys .
471.8538	I hope today , and in the coming days and weeks , we will hear from the Commission on what action they propose to take against these Member States that do not take maritime safety seriously .
91.8001	Equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which , by operating as a private , profit-making company , is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling .
428.0030	The first Greek king was a Bavarian , and it also has its effect in the present day , in that a particularly large number of people from Bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country .
285.3852	The Member of the Commission responsible , Vice-President De Palacio , therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001 .
124.5750	The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia .
17.2283	There is an agreement that has not even been initiated , and negotiations are currently continuing in Egypt .
109.5601	It will give the Serbian people the chance to rejoin the European family of nations and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbours .
18.9301	But nor was Camp David a failure , because the gulf between the parties was clearly narrowed and some serious taboos were overcome .
587.4991	Like others , I also want to express my concern about what is happening and , at the same time , say that , whenever this area is talked about , the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of its not taking very much to provoke a reaction , almost no matter what is said .
4204.3984	The explosion had been brewing for months : it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements ; when you can not find work to support your children , which is the case of my friend Talal who works as a builder in the settlements , maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family ; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around .
592.5232	The latest reports I have received - and I regret I may have to leave Parliament to go to Paris immediately - are that the parliament building has been taken over by the demonstrators in Belgrade and the television building is now in the hands of the opposition .
29.4964	It is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy Places .
57.6010	It is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations .
228.0997	We can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people , not a dictator such as Milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators .
12011.9703	Our objective is still - and I admit it - for there to be a new Yugoslavia , a Yugoslavia with an independent state of Kosovo and an independent state of Montenegro ; it is not for there to be new divisions , renewed conflict , renewed clashes or renewed force , that is not our objective ; on the contrary , a new Yugoslavia needs to emerge , a democratic Yugoslavia , where people stay willingly , not under duress , not under brutality , but because they are convinced that a federation can emerge which has a democratic future , a democratic future under different leaders and from which Milosevic can be removed - if possible - by bringing him before the court in the Hague , because we want justice , but we want justice with peace .
95.3863	Do not say in general terms , `` Serbia belongs in Europe '' , which is , after all , something which you have only recently discovered .
115.1830	Will it be by largest common denominator , or on the basis of a large majority in the Council , which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue ?
18.7113	Statement by the President on Yugoslavia
17.2192	Thank you , Mr RÃ 1/4 big .
353.6372	Before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision , I should like to express our support for it , since it endorses Parliament ' s position on relations between the European Union and Croatia .
6.3694	Legislation is already in place to achieve these aims .
2.9461	This is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt .
325.2100	I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance , but political assistance also entails financial support , because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . This can only be achieved , of course , if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere .
241.5130	A third of Croatia was occupied , and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government .
89.5531	Up until 1918 , both regions were rebellious sections of Hungary and boasted their own language , culture and identity , but were thwarted by the official state authority .
2124.3973	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the last few interventions , yesterday ' s debate and the one we are having today , show that despite the necessary and widely approved increase in the guarantee payment , and the increase in the guarantee payment for the EIB loan , as we see it , what is needed is an overall plan for this region , a contractual agreement that cuts across the political divide and incorporates aspects of economic policy , together with discussion and decision-making .
904.6539	I am grateful , on behalf of the Commission , to Mr SeppÃ $ nen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing Community guarantee for European Investment Bank lending outside the Union to cover interventions in Croatia .
22.1162	-LRB- The sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m. -RRB-
25.8540	It is on behalf of the whole House that I express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these people .
8.8408	Indeed , Mr RÃ 1/4 big , I shall do so .
44.9141	You are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar , where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine .
130.3357	I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousands of other people who are political prisoners in Burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country .
46.9094	They have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli , for instance , or turning our Treaties into a constitution .
7.4623	Is there a speaker to support this request ?
2101.2822	Mr Verheugen gave the impression that , according to the current state of play , the European Union will have ten new members by 2005 and , what is more , and this is more disturbing still , he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the Council of Ministers , which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the Nice Summit .
24.1050	Thank you , Mrs Palacio .
1446.4953	In short , here we have all the ingredients for Mr Pacheco Pereira ' s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and , therefore , the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with Mr MacCormick ' s proposal that Mr Pacheco Pereira ' s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended .
199.1721	We would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty .
165.6723	The Committee on Women ' s Rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection .
89.2624	Let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas , in a very succinct way , as befits my allotted speaking time .
0.4079	Moreover , the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject .
19.8970	I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment , particularly concerning health and safety .
20.8739	I think there are some problems left unsolved , but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments .
186.4989	I want to emphasise that , in the EU countries , we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy , and the decisions of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this .
190.7910	The fundamental notion of the general interest ought , moreover , to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness .
7.6714	The name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name .
109.9920	In conclusion , the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one .
964.4635	Our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and , in particular , from the British Conservative Party , have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme .
69.7315	We also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from developing the social economy and the services sector .
1.9493	All these coordinated social policy actions will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion .
176.6534	The working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : The policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated , and also supported by legislative measures , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods .
64.2671	We must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy .
6.1075	Thank you , Commissioner , for your interesting speech .
12.5154	The Commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance .
211.4518	At the same time , we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life , equal participation and representation , social rights , the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes .
81.1678	This means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women ' s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide , and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively .
260.5755	Women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation , and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson ' s report makes any contribution towards this .
1.4705	The women ' s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision .
237.7884	We think that it is very useful to create a web site , not only due to the increasing use of computerised media , but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded .
11.5937	I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy .
117.5453	It is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life , at the decision-making centres , in social policy , in civil society and in human rights , together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education .
3.0988	Mr President , I very much welcome the Commission ' s report .
85.3141	In the light of the latest development , I can appreciate why the Commission has , with good reason , adopted a harder line on South Korea .
4.9792	That is important in terms of the need for transparency .
88.0349	When a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy , account must be taken of the social , structural and industrial implications , and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology .
140.0090	As is well known , the Commission opposed this merger , which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed .
1696.3153	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the reports we have heard about today , and which do not just record what happened in the past , but also pick out the central themes of the present debate , and even incorporate the Commission ' s plans .
117.3694	Lastly , boosting the citizens ' autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , European competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions .
136.8629	In his report , my colleague , Mr Evans , thanks you , Mr Monti , for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy .
18.5654	Hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact , including the need for transparency , are particularly valuable .
8.8747	My feeling is that , together , we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy .
131.0551	In the year in question , there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions .
267.9539	As far as Korea is concerned , Mr Lamy , who will be coming here during the course of the week , will be better placed to update you on the latest developments .
1839.9919	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the Commission 's report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments .
251.6906	In view of the current level of economic , financial and monetary integration , the likelihood that these Member States will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view , but the mechanism must , nevertheless , remain in force .
78.4859	The directive under discussion today guarantees that traditional vine varieties , which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions , are to be maintained and protected .
149.4596	This is something that they are achieving , unfortunately , with the assistance of the French Presidency , in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumers feel .
2774.4026	It is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted , particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220 , in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs .
23.7617	There is a second problem area , Mrs Klass .
109.5840	If we were to accept this amendment , we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade , which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market .
33.1929	As a result , I consider that Article 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of our Rules of Procedure has not been respected .
3.8924	That was the legal error on your part , Madam President .
166.2452	I feel that we should also be able to make headway in the field of social affairs , on the proviso that we do not tamper with the principles that underpin the various national social security systems , which gives us some room for manoeuvre .
30.8345	The preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on closer cooperation , on very concrete bases .
48.8631	The President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Moscovici , has spoken of something that he has dubbed the ` Biarritz spirit ' .
916.3948	There is a need to reassure those who are worried that under no circumstances will the sovereignty of the Member States in taxation matters be challenged , and to also tell those who have worries that the idea is not to merge social protection systems , especially from the bottom up , but simply to see to it that the common market and the single market run smoothly within an enlarged Europe .
789.4735	As far as we are concerned , the key criteria for judging the success of the Intergovernmental Conference are whether majority decision-making is to become the fundamental decision-making principle in future , and whether the European Parliament is to be accorded the status of co-legislator in all such matters .
16.9366	There is one basic issue , however , that I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify .
30.2548	In this respect , I would also ask that a clear announcement be made regarding the proposal we are making , as we believe it makes political sense .
47.6487	This would require majority decisions in the Council to become the rule , and likewise , codecision for Parliament , in agricultural matters , for example .
393.5061	I too hope that Nice European Council is a success and welcome the fact that the peoples of Europe , and large numbers of associations , NGOs and trade unions are investing time and effort in preparing for it .
4.8206	The pattern is familiar from cooperation on issues of legal policy .
318.8825	I do not , in this respect , share the feelings of the Chairman of the Group of the European People ' s Party on the possibility of ` one Commissioner per Member State ' .
17.9326	I would also like to return to the issue of the number of Members of the European Parliament .
6.8716	Given the circumstances , how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development ?
650.6565	I therefore believe that with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow , we are giving a very clear mandate to our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , to enable them to present a proposal to this end at the Nice Summit .
67.5386	That would seem to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and I hope that headway can be made on this matter between now and Nice .
370.5423	Unfortunately , France acted more as a spokesperson for its own interests and for those of the large countries than for proposals which could bridge those contradictions , even if Mr Moscovici is now trying to convince us that the opposite is true .
103.5203	I have to say that Article 93 , in the form in which it has been drawn up by the Presidency , does not enable us to address even a straightforward debate .
475.4565	If the European Treaty accepted at Nice completely dilutes the influence and representation of smaller Member States , it is going to be very difficult to sell it and secure approval for it in referendums in these three countries .
1985.4155	Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , on the subject of the situation in the Middle East , two months ago this House was unanimous in praising the commitment to peace shown by Avraham Burg , the speaker of the Knesset , and Ahmad Qurie , the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council .
19.9392	Enlargement has turned from a dream into a nightmare for some people , who fear that it might upset the balance of power .
166.5343	What is really worrying , however , is that what might be called a form of blackmail is being perpetrated against those who , when it comes to reforms , do not wish to go further than they have been authorised to do by the Member States .
499.5294	Mr President , in our plenary sitting in September we experienced and shared moments of optimism and hope with Abraham Burg , speaker of the Knesset , and Ahmed Qurie , President of the Palestinian Legislative Council .
472.9566	I believe it is right that today , we once again have a joint resolution before us from all parties in which we recognise - with due consideration for maintaining an equilibrium - that both parties must restore the peace ; we as nations can not do that .
45.1027	We are the opposition and I feel that we have the right to vote for resolutions in favour of the Charter which differ from those tabled by the majority .
6.0243	This procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective .
5.4389	To do otherwise would lead us down a blind alley .
178.2438	Examples include the European company , the pan-European liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services , which is stumbling along , the opening-up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation .
39.2359	All the same , we did make reference to the intelligent and open work that culminated in this Charter , in which national parliaments representing national opinions participated .
8.3007	Finally , I would like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for her intervention .
322.5212	To the left of us , we have Karl Marx , the revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights , because , in his view , the human does not exist in the abstract , and humanity could not constitute anything at all .
195.3589	Thirty years ago , great countries in the South of Europe lived under dictatorship , and Eastern Europe was subsisting under the yoke of the Soviet Union .
8.6700	At all events , do not kill it off today .
909.4034	Anyone who has studied the issue is aware of the mystery of the translations : while the Italian version adopts the principle that island status is one of the valid criteria for Community intervention , the French and other translations express a different concept and the English translation is ambiguous and could be interpreted in either way .
23.0519	I shall now return to each of these points , but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate .
543.1504	I could confine myself to thanking Mr Duhamel , and to simply pointing out that his text contains a quite unwarranted attack on President Prodi - his were , of course , humorous comments - or even observing that he has not said exactly how he wants this constitution to be arrived at .
223.6747	Next , there is - and once again it is inevitable , yet questionable - an element of randomness , which is understandable , in the decisions made by the European Institute of Florence .
398.6161	I understand that our Italian friends , for the most part , have found some discrepancies between the different language versions of Article 158 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Treaty , some shades of meaning and outright differences , which may give rise to differing interpretations .
754.7197	I completely share Parliament ' s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged , but I have noticed , Mr Gil-Robles , a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible , as in point 11 of your resolution , and I would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect .
253.2095	During the first phase , we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force , in a clear and comprehensible manner .
349.1484	The rapporteur is quite correct in firmly stressing the need for the Commission ' s powers of initiative and the participation of Parliament , at least on a consultation procedure basis , to be the norm whenever there is reinforced cooperation .
0.2202	The work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement .
0.2101	It has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes .
12.3683	We should nevertheless first ask ourselves what exactly our citizens want for the Europe of tomorrow .
41.6823	What is so serious about Mr Tautology ' s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery .
36.2928	Unfortunately , our hopes were dashed because , in addition to all their other problems , islands are paying the price for the different translations of the point in question .
99.6983	In order to achieve this objective we must ask the Nice Council to open up the important reformist approach that can bring together political consensus and public support .
940.4961	I hope that the French Presidency will find a more efficient and imaginative way of assuring the candidate countries and the public throughout Europe that we are not only addressing important technical issues but above all the political necessity to provide our continent with stability through the certain and guaranteed enlargement of our European Union .
72.6023	The Duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting . I would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our Group .
947.0973	Mr President , the question tabled by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , refers to a very real issue and I think Commissioner Barnier ' s response and that of the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Moscovici , were very clear .
1053.8314	Now what we need is for the summit in Nice to demonstrate the political will to ensure that the Nice Treaty combines these proposals , and other proposals formulated on other occasions , into an integrated institutional framework which allows the European process to advance properly and the European Union to welcome the new Member States in a positive and sound manner .
3416.3139	Report -LRB- A5-0290 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Riis-JÃ ¸ rgensen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission ' s XXIXth report on Competition Policy - 1999 -LSB- SEC -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 720 - C5-0302 / 2000 - 2000/2153 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB-
8.8499	I have already notified the Registry .
112.9820	Texts like these confirm the fact that the role allotted to the European institutions , including Parliament , is to be of service to the narrow band of the well-to-do .
177.2378	'' It is because parliamentary immunity is independent that our institution has the power to review requests for waiver , particularly with regard to ` fumus persecutionis ' i.e. the presumption that criminal proceedings have been brought with the intention of causing the Member political damage .
9.6169	Vine material provides the basis for optimum grape and wine production in terms of quality , class and quantity .
550.6443	As far as new scientific techniques such as in vitro propagation are concerned , reference should be made to the fact that meristem propagation is excluded from in vitro propagation of material because , as we all know from numerous years ' experience and experiments by institutes , mutations occur when these points of the plant are used .
35.7544	These mergers may have brought profits to the shareholders in the companies involved , but they have also cost their workers , their families and society as a whole very dear .
12.4427	Mr Fatuzzo , I am unable to answer that question , for this is an explanation of vote .
30.3382	For the purposes of this grant aid , a small and medium-sized enterprise is a company that employs less then 250 people .
326.4560	The principle of market rules as the sole form of social regulation tends to do away with man and his creativity as individuals in the economy and the productive process and , more importantly , is indifferent to man ' s prosperity and only interested in the welfare of enterprise .
302.1464	Attempts to erode measures to protect workers still further , the attack from all fronts on the rights which they have fought for , in conjunction with attempts to minimise the specific weight of the public sector and the balancing function which state aid can exercise , do nothing except increase grass-roots dissatisfaction and leave workers no choice but to fight and resist .
327.9347	the report -LRB- A5-0236 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Colom i Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the Interinstitutional Agreement on financial statements .
481.1545	Therefore , in principle , we have raised the payments in headings 3 , 4 and 7 to a level that will ensure 25 % coverage of the commitments to be entered into in 2001 as regards individual budgetary lines .
431.3499	If you now take a look at the lines covering labour market measures and local employment initiatives , you will see that a total of almost EUR 150 million has been made available for job creation measures under heading 3 .
76.9854	We can not go on like this , slugging it out with one another budget after budget ; always over the same issues , and always going through the same motions .
14.1279	This Parliament represents the people of Europe .
46.5050	The Council would do well to ensure that that is how things remain in future , particularly in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
5.8041	The Committee of the Regions is currently giving less cause for concern .
12.8106	We believe that changes are called for here , and would urge the Commission to look into this .
2.8778	The Commission has echoed this proposal , and we are now prepared to support it .
2182.5637	That is why , when the Ministers for Foreign Affairs meet and take some commendable decision or other , such as helping Kosovo or Serbia , the least of their concerns is whether there is enough money to finance the decision and whether it has to be taken from elsewhere , such as aid to development in Africa , the MEDA programme or the promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union .
0.2404	Modesty has prevented you from ending the list of rapporteurs with your own name .
274.3728	In growing by 3.5 % for the year 2001 , the draft Community budget is being increased by a far greater margin than the Member States are permitting themselves for their national budgets .
144.9508	The Council has not deemed it desirable to take up the programming proposed by the Commission , either in the proposal for a framework regulation or in its preliminary draft budget for 2001 .
1976.2010	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , budgetary policy always requires foresight , and today we are discussing Budget 2001 , the budget for next year , and so together we must decide what demands there will be on European policy and the European budget next year , which we will need to fulfil , and what challenges we will face there .
470.1885	I would like to take this opportunity to say a special word of thanks to Parliament and to the rapporteurs , Mrs Haug , Mr Ferber , Mrs RÃ 1/4 hle and Mr Colom i Naval .
0.2151	But I would also urge Parliament to be prepared to negotiate in these matters .
311.1216	As to the question as to whether it will be possible to reallocate funds from agricultural policy , we will see that you get the latest forecasts on agricultural expenditure in the near future .
173.0674	Looking at the evaluation reports , the Commission has produced a lot of documentation concerning the preliminary draft budget , for example for 2001 , which included a working document presenting summaries of results of a number of mostly external evaluations .
30.9385	I think that , were they to support this amendment , my fellow Members would be setting in place a technically fair and politically timely act .
444.7763	In particular , we will again recommend , at second reading , that 60 new posts be created at the European Court of Justice , and , in addition , that the necessary funding be made available in the budget .
5471.8848	I am therefore pleased , and would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Budgets , and above all , the general rapporteur , for the fact that we have at last worked out a joint plan on how to rectify the difficulties attending this draft budget , with a view to accommodating Parliament ' s clear priorities , and boosting employment and social cohesion , although , naturally the situation still leaves something to be desired from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
31.5739	In that regard , I would draw the Commission ' s and the House ' s attention to the following issues .
47.1873	I have to add , however , that sugar policy , for example , is now again the topic of debate , also within the Commission .
44.9022	We have criticised the shortcomings and the marginal role of the Commission in the policy of control and observation and we therefore believe that this policy must be supported with an increased budget .
81.9212	Support from ISPA , which is designed for preparations for enlargement , should be used to part-finance the launching of projects , so that limited resources can be used effectively .
56.5318	Even in 1999 , as much as EUR 3.2 million was refunded to the Member States because those resources were not spent .
6.4189	We also hope that this heading will be approved .
114.4658	I should like to draw attention to the fact that the issue we are petitioned on is the question of fraud and mismanagement of money in the European Union .
0.2584	We must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective .
35.9500	I personally did not put my signature to them because one or two of them still go a little too far .
2.9090	We are looking to rebuild people ' s confidence in our institutions .
213.0223	What we are not prepared to do though , is to simply dismiss out of hand , things we believe to be necessary , and which have been recognised as necessities following negotiations with yourself and the Commission , when there are new items on the agenda .
0.2113	But that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them .
210.3622	Administration in the EU has been inexcusably poor , since , for example , last spring around EUR 3 billion of unused funds were returned to Member States .
7.5821	It is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the Community severely to the test .
271.9655	Above all , we call upon the parliamentary majority to again think carefully about whether all the staff - i.e. all 400 posts - should really be placed in the reserve , or whether it would not in fact make sense to come to a different vote on this matter .
51.2689	This has got to be the worst possible message to be sending out to our friends and neighbours around the Mediterranean at the time of enlargement .
55.8438	Mr President , the EU ' s budget is the Union ' s choice instrument to define political areas of interest as well as core areas .
16.1182	There is therefore little prospect of us receiving additional revenue in the form of higher contribution payments from the Member States .
538.4141	Rather than carrying out a technical analysis of the budget or an interpretation of the amounts provided for in the respective ` revenue ' and ` expenditure ' columns , Parliament should concern itself with the quality of both expenditure that has been released and expenditure that has been proposed , which specifically requires an assessment of the criteria for the use of appropriations and also an assessment of their impact .
222.0704	Fourthly , with regard to the reform of the Commission ' s procedures and staffing policy , we must distinguish between issues relating to new admissions and the desirable - as far as we are concerned - creation of a permanent and compulsory early retirement system .
1.5244	In fact , we have problem in that we have given too much .
75.4637	If that happens we have major problems and Mr Wurtz may be our best friend at the end of the day .
24.8560	Question No 1 by -LRB- H-0709 / 00 -RRB- :
24.1047	Question No 3 by -LRB- H-0714 / 00 -RRB- :
25.2876	Question No 5 by -LRB- H-0776 / 00 -RRB- :
237.1333	You may rest assured , finally , that respect for human rights , and the promotion of human rights , are , in any case , a key component of the European Union ' s cooperation with third countries .
14.6331	In the port of Buenaventura , 20 peasant-farmers were murdered .
11.2633	Mr De Rossa has the floor on a point of order .
1.7455	As far as possible , the debate should not be academic and theoretical .
3693.4655	Subject : Viability of Tobin-type taxes at European level In view of the recent report issued by the French Minister of Finance indicating that Tobin-type taxes would not be viable if introduced by a single Member State , what steps does the French Presidency propose with a view to securing the viability of such taxes at European Union and global level ?
134.8369	We are even aware , and this is an economic line of reasoning , that if there were a broad consensus , then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory .
1.8417	Let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax .
68.2568	I should just like to repeat what I was saying , which is that the influence of a tax of this kind on the volatility of the exchange market has not actually been proven .
784.7256	As regards the question you addressed to the Council , i.e. the idea of study , please be assured that I shall convey your idea , most sympathetically , to the chairman of the Ecofin council , who incidentally is also a Government Minister , and perhaps this will also answer Mr Harlem DÃ © sir ' s concerns .
25.2876	Question No 15 by -LRB- H-0729 / 00 -RRB- :
129.6105	Mr President , I thank the minister for his reply to the first part of my question , but his answer to the second part , which concerned compensation , was not entirely relevant .
2.7770	I was at a foreign affairs meeting when this question came up .
4.4375	This is what we wanted to do in this context .
1030.3613	In my opinion , the Commission has put up a poor show and the Council has compounded the situation by beating the Commission down on its agricultural expenditure schedule right at the start of this year in the Council meeting of July of this year .
88.5064	I would nevertheless emphasise , in particular , that , six months ago , one of the political priorities was stressed in this Chamber .
116.8794	It will be not unknown to some Members here that my party , the UKIP , seeks the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union .
24.5085	In the medium term we will see the importance of the decisions that Parliament is beginning to take today .
544.9138	On the first point , I believe that this budget continues to apply the principles of budgetary rigour , budgetary prudence , improving efficiency , more effective budget control , better use of resources and a general tightening up , which are all vital to increase the confidence of the EU citizen in the institutions .
235.1161	There needs to be greater vigour and determination for the Parliament , Council and Commission to cooperate as closely as possible on issues such as translation , interpretation , libraries and buildings .
173.0915	There are major organisational changes under way , and there is a need for a new culture involving both a genuine desire to accept responsibility for implementing the individual parts of the Budget and acceptance of the fact that there are consequences if the responsibility is not fulfilled .
100.7768	The Commission is now quoting a figure of 1.07 , and the Council wants a figure of 1.05 . 1.27 is really the Agenda figure .
8318.7666	In Berlin last year it was agreed that the budgetary provision for agriculture for the period 2000-2006 will be over Â # 506 billion , that the 15 Member States of the European Union will continue to contribute 1.3 % of gross national product to the overall annual budget - which of course includes measures to finance the proposed enlargement of the European Union , a proposal which I and my other colleagues fully support .
43.2978	Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , that was a political act which was not particularly received well by the Albanian Kosovars .
385.9693	The European Parliament has just one way of showing that it has self-respect and respect for the people in the Member States and that is to accept the amendment tabled by our group and reject the entire budget .
856.0539	Those responsible for politics and the economy in Serbia emphasise again and again that they do not wish to become dependent upon our help , but that they need our help now in order to alleviate need in the short term and that they will then need help to help themselves introduce a social market economy in the medium and long term and in order also to make necessary foreign investment possible .
104.7721	The mainstay of Parliament ' s strategy should be to force the Council to guarantee that new resources will be allocated to new objectives , in order to prevent these new objectives from being implemented using resources earmarked for existing priorities .
583.6034	Mr President , it is a promising development that , this year , we are close to sharing the Council ' s views where most of the important points are concerned and that we can show budgetary discipline but still uphold most of Parliament ' s priorities .
225.6270	It is perhaps a kind of transitional year , a year wedged between last year ' s nerve-racking events and those which may lie ahead next year .
376.7502	At the Council meeting -LRB- Budget -RRB- , which takes place at the end of November , initiatives ought , in my opinion , to be taken to produce a significantly lower rate of increase for category 1 .
207.8445	On the other hand , it is important for the peace of mind of thousands of workers , and compatible with the overall amount planned , that the level of aid planned for this financial year for the social chapter for coal should be maintained .
8.3201	We should look at this again .
7.7131	The fishermen are inactive , tired and disappointed .
679.0032	I would ask that we be given the flexibility to achieve that possibility , to achieve the jobs , to achieve the employment and to be able to put the people of Northern Ireland back to work again , back to work in real politics rather than looking into other reasons as to why they may want to disagree with each other .
444.5818	The proposal for a regulation which is being examined by Parliament today implements these provisions , transposes the Community legislation and establishes the office of European Data Protection Supervisor , thereby providing appropriate , tangible guarantees of this fundamental right .
6.5007	Freedom of movement requires effective crime prevention , which is less successful without effective protection of privacy .
1.7423	We are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied .
199.4150	In addition to the restrictive reading of Article 286 , however , it would have been possible to take Article 255 of the Treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation .
727.5523	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , while I congratulate Mrs Paciotti on her excellent work , I would also emphasise the need to move quickly in this field , which was , in fact , the purpose of completing this dossier at first reading .
76.2118	Amendments Nos 3 and 11 differ from the Council text , but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency .
20.4320	The text would be improved if it were amended to make that clear , perhaps this can be done when it is proof-read .
188.5585	Article 299 -LRB- 2 -RRB- primarily expresses a political will , supported on repeated occasions by the European Council and , today , by the European Parliament .
35.3417	Mr President , the rapporteur , Mrs Sudre , has done a good job on her report on the outermost regions .
266.1974	The bulk of the section dealing with fisheries actually consists of an amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
39.9578	For more than a decade the European Commission has been aware of our problems and our particular characteristics .
183.4243	The outermost regions bring Atlantic , American and African dimensions to Europe , which enrich our cultural , political and economic diversity , of which we are all rightly proud .
41.8447	Tomorrow they may become a laboratory providing the finest illustration of the effectiveness of the experiment of the European social model .
1358.1455	Just as you , Mrs Sudre , as the representative of the outermost regions , rightly call for solidarity , I would also request solidarity on your part where the interests of the Objective 1 regions are concerned , in the sense that no reductions in funds should be implemented for as long as the regions concerned are still handicapped in comparison with the developed regions of Europe .
1077.5565	Under this article , the outermost regions obtained recognition by the European Union of a genuine right to be different , a right to be dealt with on a specific and special basis reflecting their unique situation , a situation that is completely different to that of the rest of the European Union .
384.1914	This is the message that I wanted to put across , as well as once again congratulating Mrs Sudre and all the members of the various committees , which have enabled us to get as far as this report today .
1.7716	This balance , ladies and gentlemen , must be sought initially on a case-by-case basis .
13.5749	In the field of agriculture , we are preparing the reform of the implementing regulations for measures under the POSEI programmes .
83.5556	Quite the opposite , I think that these new technologies , Internet access , and all the employment opportunities related to these are a great opportunity for the remote or outermost regions .
21.6034	The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
3.2702	I wonder whether in fact there should be some provision in the Rules for that .
12.9470	In any case , ladies and gentlemen , we will discuss the matter at the next Bureau meeting .
102.0939	It will be within a small headquarters , professionally run , accessible to the Commission and Parliament , although the site is not for now .
6.5232	The more than eighty measures from the White Paper are therefore indispensable .
40.8334	Food safety is a global task ; we should not cut ourselves off from produce from the United States or developing countries .
16.8902	It must be independent with regard to the Member States , the European institutions and the agro-food industry .
329.8042	This has to be called an `` authority '' because in English and most other languages , that conveys a body which has the power and ability from time to time in the process of risk assessment to use its best judgment and not merely to be the agent of what others would wish it to do .
37.2022	In this connection , I should like to speak up for cheap food of the kind which families with children buy and which children and young people eat .
41.1488	Secondly , the Bowis report clearly states that the European Food Safety Agency is responsible for risk analysis .
24.3352	The Member States have risen to the situation , like France , which has set up a national food safety agency .
27.2032	That is one of the areas of diversity that makes up the richness of Europe and its quality of life .
10.2629	That is precisely what the WHO does for us : working with its regional organisations in a wholly integrated manner .
87.0508	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur , Mr Bowis has produced an excellent report , and in many areas I would like to reinforce what he has said .
2.1236	We need to apply stricter legislation , stricter guidelines and stricter criteria to animal feed .
15.3184	I therefore want to discuss Amendment No 16 .
2.7870	The Community is the world 's largest importer and exporter of food .
970.1993	In short , it will be important to see how its independence and transparency are reconciled with the fact that no current resources have been allocated to it , with its subordination to the Commission , on the one hand , and with its authority to act autonomously and the membership of its board of directors on the other .
74.4336	The establishment of a European Food Safety Agency will contribute greatly to achieving a high level of protection of citizens ' health .
25.6088	I have tabled an amendment which is not unimportant , in my view , although Mr Whitehead suggested it was redundant .
11.1747	In my view , nothing less will restore consumer confidence in an important policy area both for producers and consumers .
31.3753	From now on , the policy will be tackled in a coordinated and integrated manner and will embrace the entire food chain .
14.6482	This is why we need this food authority and this is why we are right to set the necessary store by it .
79.9847	For that reason , I support Amendment Nos 14 and 19 , which express a desire for principled guidance in deciding a future location .
5.5907	In my opinion , that was a wise policy .
6.6814	Allow me to highlight a number of points .
374.8847	Mr President , while the European food chain is one of the safest in the world , poor practice , and indeed recent scandals , have set an agenda to which our Commissioner , Mr Byrne , has responded admirably .
12.2597	There are already very many organisations and institutions , not to mention associations and initiatives , concerned with food safety .
1.9262	Making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly .
15.4005	As Mr Blokland rightly says , almost certainly not .
30.0475	I particularly wish to stress that the Agency and the present system of advisory committees can not exist side by side .
31.9857	I therefore call upon the Commissioner to avoid excessive legislation and bureaucratic burdens as far as possible , particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned .
1.6672	I hope that this will be given due consideration in the new proposal .
43.1800	Indeed , the food authority is conceived as a point of scientific excellence at the service of the Community in its broadest sense : consumers , the institutions and Member States alike .
69.3864	It is right and proper and I support Parliament 's desire to see Articles 95 and 152 of the Treaty employed to this effect .
38.6362	Certainly , much remains to be done , and this is why we must all welcome the Commission 's proposal as a positive step .
44.0826	In this sense , there must be a sharp focus on the issue and actions must be undertaken to further raise awareness in order to prevent the matter fading into obscurity .
65.6499	In this field , too , the Commission can and should play an invaluable role , and it should tell us what it proposes to do in future in this context .
27.4920	Our question to the Commission is intended to encourage it to continue down this path and to strengthen this initiative still further .
55.5247	I should also like to mention the key role played by civil society , by highly motivated non-governmental organisations and , in particular , by the international campaign to ban landmines .
5.2774	We have to acknowledge the specific situation in certain countries .
290.8676	Turning now specifically to the Bonino report , I would like to comment briefly on the very few amendments by Parliament which the Commission has some difficulty in taking on board in their current form .
32.6102	As well as pursuing local capacity-building and ownership , we must be able to draw on the best existing expertise and material wherever it is available .
61.0172	We should concentrate our political attention on the real culprits : warring factions and irresponsible governments who have shown no concern about civil populations and who use anti-personnel landmines as indiscriminate weapons of terror .
7.3111	Top-level commitment , proper direction and management with responsibility are the keys to the effective use of resources .
16.4701	I believe that , as far as that is concerned , you and Parliament are on the same side .
17.9932	Finally , I should like to thank Mrs Bonino .
682.7909	We must bear this in mind because it seems to me , as far as the Balkans are concerned , that the West and the European Union must take their share of the responsibility , as the result of their political interventions , for the fact that half the Balkans are a total minefield .
196.9575	One point that NGO representatives have criticised in conversation with me is the combination of military activity with NGO work found in points 11 and 15 of the resolution .
52.5635	It is imperative for a ban to be imposed on producing mines in the EU and on exporting mines from the EU .
5.6085	I believe it is healthy to strengthen the civil obligations of any organisation which has military activities .
1941.6713	The Titley report , which we voted on a few days ago , basically represents a second step forward on questions of common foreign , defence and security policy which will , I believe , slowly but surely build up into a global policy for the European Union with flesh on its bones in the form of uniform terms and uniform rules .
180.5297	Mr President , one day in December 1992 , a young shepherd in Mozambique forgot the risk : he thought it had gone with the coming of peace .
28.2916	Whatever the outcome , we will all of us together show that we are determined to fight against what has to be called ' a cowards ' war ' .
81.7128	Finland can not be put in the same category as many less developed countries , where the use of mines is very random and the inevitable consequences of that are evident .
13.0370	Finland herself is responsible for her credible defence arrangement .
2414.3037	Our efforts over all these years have been to this end , including in 1998 when the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe , over which I have the honour of presiding , awarded its annual prize to Mr Axworthy , Minister for Foreign Affairs in Canada , for the efforts of his government which took concrete form in the Ottawa Convention .
76.6973	I can not resist the pleasure of indulging in terms , or rather coining phrases , worthy of those used in the report in order to condemn your repeated e-pocrisy regarding employment and social protection .
156.4760	In our capacity as Swedish Liberals , we see European integration as a possible way of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across the borders , human rights and conflict management .
19.7228	Furthermore , the request that there should be a legal basis for NGOs to regulate a `` civil dialogue '' is not acceptable .
20.2121	The only area in which it is precise is on the right of ownership and entrepreneurial freedom , which only concerns owners of capital .
30.7800	Thus those who would like to see Parliament become an ` echo chamber ' for the more populous countries ' revisionist intentions will be defeated .
274.1377	The Biarritz Summit was heralded as the decisive Summit which would affirm fundamental rights , all rights , even rights never conceived of previously , as if the European Communities and their constituent States had hitherto lived in total chaos .
72.7949	I agree with what Mr Berthu has said , that the idea of a single state with a single constitution completely undermines the national sovereignty of the Member States .
92.3547	We nonetheless agree with the report when it points out that , in their present wording , the Treaties leave a lot to be desired in terms of simplicity and transparency .
37.3846	This choice should be made independently and freely and should not have to depend on an imposed measure that might clash with the constitutional practice of an individual country .
21.9648	It is not built for the people , for there is not a single word on the social content of Europe .
68.3987	A constitution would commit the Member States to venturing onto very dangerous ground , which could lead a constitutional court to gradually deprive the nations of the prerogatives the states intend to continue exercising .
4.1645	the principle of the separation of powers and the rule of law
8.4592	We welcome attempts to improve them .
201.3349	That is why we must fervently hope that the Nice Summit and the Intergovernmental Conference prove a success , so as to enable us , quite simply , to make further progress very rapidly .
0.6334	In this way , Mr Gil-Robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy .
14.9877	In reality , the European Parliament is practising delay tactics .
0.4432	However , as these provisions now stand , this mechanism can not function correctly .
20.0535	There is a need for institutional equality in the context of the negotiations on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
17.6290	They are not leader groups but reflect a diversity which , with 30 Member States , will only increase .
18.1251	The Pensioners ' Party and the pensioners who support it are very familiar with these islands for they are a key tourist destination .
13769.7922	When our regions , in the West Indies for example , or the Pacific , are tax havens used by the American multinationals , from Kodak to Microsoft , Boeing or Cargill , for massive tax-fraud exports , then the right to geographically equal competition , together with the right of all Europeans to equality , requires that we devote part of the European budget , in which taxes make up 17 % of revenue , to developing the economic , social and cultural life of our compatriots who live in regions that may well be outermost in terms of geography but are central in terms of civilisation .
31.6607	In any case , we have , however , subordinated our repugnance for this topic ' s colonial backdrop to the interests of those living in the regions concerned .
3.4124	The use of animal meal , which is triggering a new food crisis , is unacceptable .
1179.1993	At first glance , the Commission 's White Paper on food safety appears to be full of good intentions , since it mainly proposes the creation of a European Food Safety Agency responsible for managing a rapid alert network and totally independent when it advises the management authorities .
762.5159	That is not at all the view of the White Paper , which calls for the agency to develop very close working links with the Commission services because , as it explains with a certain aplomb , `` it will allow the Authority -LRB- Agency -RRB- to be responsive to the needs of the Commission services '' -LRB- page 20 -RRB- .
1581.6753	If we take a look at recent events , we find that with regard to BSE , for example , and taking only the case of France , it is the existence of a competent and independent national Food Safety Agency that allowed the French authorities to rapidly take the decisions needed to protect the health of its people .
41.2378	As you know , there have been attacks on synagogues in several European countries in the last few days .
1044.6351	You see , if we accept one single amendment - you know this , fellow delegates know it , I have said it more than once - then we will , as it were , already be in breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement , because we will then have gone over the margin for payments .
287.9667	Here it is intended to place the total amount against the line - so there are no longer any reserves - and at the same time , the appropriations are to be increased by EUR 300 000 to 1.8 million .
3.1422	If I am being honest , I feel we are to some extent deceiving the electorate .
10.8869	Section IV , Court of Justice
4.4222	I simply propose this minor correction , if nobody opposes it .
19.1503	-LRB- Parliament adopted the resolution -RRB-
104.1637	It is not reasonable for approximately half of the Union ' s total budget each year to be spent on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products .
98.3207	We must dedicate ourselves to upholding the European ideals of inclusiveness and democracy and resist the pressure of those groups that wish to maintain an anti-European monopolistic control .
339.2430	- -LRB- SV -RRB- As Swedish and Danish Social Democrats , we have today voted in favour of Parliament ' s proposal on the EU budget for the budget year 2001 .
14.2737	However , this revision must not , as is quite possible , result in further substantial cuts in the agriculture sector .
60.2063	Considerable sums have already been awarded to the bosses in this sector , allowing them to diversify into juicy new sectors , while many workers - whose jobs have been eliminated - are still unemployed .
84.9881	A high quality European public service must be imposed , to include mobiles phones and the Internet , to meet the basic needs of employees and users .
74.3720	The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report that would remove the subsidies paid to the producers of processed fruit and vegetables .
94.2062	In a bid to safeguard industrial peace in urban areas , the price of the food package has been kept artificially low for dozens of years now .
124.2663	It is now absolutely vital for the Portuguese Government not to give in and for it to staunchly defend its specific national interests on each of these points .
392.9526	I believe that we can only help these states if we improve the conditions in which all their inhabitants live , be they young people , workers or members of a group very close to my heart , the elderly people and pensioners who live in the ACP States .
128.3729	We disagree with this measure because , whichever way you look at it , the ` polluter pays ' principle is a hypocritical principle and its distorted application will ensure that the entire cost of reducing emissions is passed on directly to consumers , i.e. to the workers .
185.7156	I fear that the forthcoming climate conference will be exploited as an opportunity to moderate the previously agreed commitment to reduce emission levels by 5.2 % in the rich countries .
11.6768	Moreover the development of nuclear energy and carbon sinks must be excluded from the calculations for the reduction of emissions .
36.3483	If these chemical substances really cause an increase in certain types of cancer , reduce fertility or threaten unborn life , something has to be done about it .
382.1558	Listing and studying the phenomenon of disruption of the endocrine systems of men and animals , validating the studies , and demonstrating the causal links between certain products and certain anomalies found in humans and animals -LRB- decline in fertility , certain malformations , certain cancers -RRB- , is a necessary point of departure as long as it respects the precautionary principle and at the same time promotes a need for transparency totally absent from the text .
2.9869	In order for this standardisation process to work , we need coordination .
11.7331	Moreover , volume and number of retail payments only form a small percentage of the total number of credit transfers .
148.7763	At that time we had to note on the one hand that freight transport had been made considerably easier , but that on the other there were still major barriers and costs associated with making the corresponding payments .
192.5223	In the European Parliament in our work in committee , we also very much regretted the fact that the offer made by the European Central Bank was not accepted .
133.9445	What is becoming important - and the report rightly refers to this - is consumer preference for electronic payments , and here we call for progress to be made so that here too an interoperable multi-currency standard for electronic purses can actually be introduced .
9.9391	Consumers are discouraged from shopping internationally .
23.8046	The documents I have looked at put their share as low as 0.2 % to 0.04 % .
339.7145	It is only right that the banking sector should be tackled and given a stiff talking to , for while the most important techniques and standards are in place , there is still no flexibility in sight for cross-border credit transfers for amounts up to EUR 50 000 .
32.7651	Just as Mrs Randzio-Plath said , we can not order banks to reduce charges as a result of political decisions .
94.4015	We in Brussels are of course experiencing this ourselves as Members , but our colleagues are too , that we do not make transfers abroad because of the high charges linked to the euro .
193.1791	After the European passport , this is the second concrete proof , which will actually make a tangible difference on a day-to-day basis , that we all belong to the European Union .
17.6409	The rapporteur ' s report also focuses on the declarations of statistical data which banks need to produce for each cross-border transfer .
3552.9989	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0267 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Montfort on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Council decision on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship , 2001-2005 -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 256 - C5-0274 / 2000 - 2000/0107 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RSB- .
5.7456	I hope the vote in this House will replicate the unanimity shown in the Committee on Industry .
41.2494	Greater differentiation ought to be possible here ; the regions need to be involved if we are to get an accurate picture of the impact of enterprise-friendly policies .
680.0060	And , along those lines , we too have tabled and pressed for a series of strong , concrete proposals for moving from words to deeds , in relation to SMEs , by giving them access to innovation and electronic commerce , simplifying certain customs formalities for them , ending certain disparities in administration and regulations , developing - and this is important - access to risk capital , developing the Euro Info Centres to broaden the scope of business information and support , and making the framework programme for research and technological development more open to innovative SMEs .
25.9108	The effective implementation of the acquis is necessary to ensure that enlargement becomes a win-win situation for the Member States and candidate countries alike .
19.6491	We must encourage them , promote local development using local resources , both material and human , and foster their relations with local communities .
40.9625	Mr President , Commissioner , small and medium-sized businesses , both in the manufacturing and in the service sectors , can only survive on the market if they have full order books .
24.4646	In our opinion , a third point of concern is the protection of intellectual property rights at European level .
89.1008	We all know that the pace at which we live our lives has become faster because we use mobile telephones , e-mail and the Internet , and this opens up entirely new possibilities .
656.2503	The explanatory statement emphasises that the term SME can equally relate to a business employing up to 500 employees and to a craft business employing only two or three people and that , taken all together , these represent 99 % of the Union ' s businesses .
389.9660	Because of its financial limitations , I think the multiannual programme merely acknowledges the problem and gives a positive political bearing and encouragement , but is not in a position to give any substantial help or , more importantly , to reverse the prevalent trends in the present economy , which are literally crushing small enterprises in every sector .
196.2067	The problem in small and medium-sized businesses is that they do not have a lot of resources to go out and get information , to find out what grants and help are available , to do the sort of administrative tasks that are increasingly being imposed upon them by national governments .
17.1251	Account should be taken of that in implementing the programme but there are no grounds for mentioning them separately in the legislative text .
3.5371	The multiannual programme will be committed to improving the modus operandi of small and medium-sized businesses .
19.5117	Border fortifications and repressive policing measures will not stem the tide of those seeking a share of the prosperity which we all enjoy .
53.2229	I think that this is a shame , although what the group has done is not wrong because it touches on the right problems and also tries to point out the right possible solutions .
2.9310	To achieve this , measures are needed which work in two different directions .
100.4031	Recently , we have , thank heavens , seen positive signals emerging from that part of the Balkans that has an indirect impact on Albania .
322.2013	It is very sad to realise that , today in Western Europe , we are trying to create laws that would punish those who are hiding Anne Frank ' s unborn grandchildren .
5.1687	The issue of schools and child reception must be addressed .
288.5516	What happened is proof positive that the European Union ' s aim must be to establish structures which will ensure that democratic rules are respected and that the rights of minorities in Albania are recognised and respected .
41.3319	For this to be the case , it is absolutely essential to draw up plans for a coordinated repatriation operation and , above all , to involve non-governmental and international organisations .
5.9954	Economic growth enables difficulties to be overcome in crisis areas .
4.0114	This is an awareness that we must all help to foster .
95.7402	Mr President , the conclusions of the European Council at Tampere called for firmer external action in the area of legal and internal affairs .
10.7507	I wish to raise three points for consideration , which the Commission regards as particularly important .
116.3663	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market explicitly calls on the Commission to resist the legislative pressure to which it has itself objected .
58.2500	We want a strong union which takes full responsibility for the tasks incumbent on it , which creates a well-functioning internal market and which actually makes it possible to strengthen social and regional cohesion .
421.8921	I was delighted to note that Amendments Nos 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , which I tabled myself , have been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
1899.1066	'' I hear similar things from residents of the Island of Islay , where the proposal for the protection of the local seal colony by a grand international body is resented , because the people have looked after the seals better for the last 2000 years than we think a grander organisation is likely to do in the future .
3.5540	They must be asked to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
29.1527	The second paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is utterly unintelligible .
128.0757	Regardless of the reasons that may have caused this mistake , it is certain that it is motivated by the constant initiatives , originating in the Commission , that are carried out with regard to legislation .
377.5682	In other words , Mr President , the principle of subsidiarity is probably the principle that fuses , brings together and sums up what the building of Europe is all about , because ultimately it is nothing but the political will that is included in the Treaty .
106.6826	Actually , this screening of the existing acquis communautaire is often a very useful exercise in showing that it is not always necessary to legislate at Community level or whether a law is too detailed for legislation at the Community level .
148.2624	I hope that we can continue this debate so that it is not only a routine matter on Thursday afternoon but part of the central debate on Community legislation as a whole .
0.2362	These charges still exist , both for exchanging cash and for making cross-border payments .
3.2479	His passivity is the best guarantee for permanent charges and continuing frustration .
748.7917	Faced with this situation and the imminence of negotiations which might begin next Monday in Brussels , I do not think the Commission will give us much information today , due to the fact that it will do this - we hope - on Monday 30 October .
8455.4277	From this rostrum and with the weight of representing European democracy on our shoulders , I call for good sense and wisdom from both parties , who will meet in Brussels on 30 October at the highest level - the European Fisheries Commissioner and the Moroccan Minister for Fisheries if , as I hope , his attendance in Brussels is confirmed , and the technical delegations , with the Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Morocco , if this too is confirmed , with the Director-General for Fisheries of the European Union as chair - so that serious dialogue may take place and solutions be found .
138.6421	Mr President , Commissioner , tomorrow it will be exactly a year since our last debate here in Parliament on the subject of Morocco .
20.8573	I wish the Commissioner all the luck in the world and bid a very warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation .
20.1517	Moroccan agriculture enjoys special treatment when exporting to Europe .
116.7001	The fishermen in particular can not be blamed for not understanding the situation and for being very disappointed about the fact that the negotiations concerning the Morocco agreement have dragged on .
699.8689	Mr President , we are debating the third agreement with Morocco , which above all concerns French and Portuguese fishermen , who make up the bulk of the fleet , even though a small number of French and Swedish fishermen are also concerned .
0.4504	It is actually easier to defend the suburbs than it is to defend Morocco .
13.7473	As this key date is so close , I believe that we must be extremely careful with what is drawn up .
26.0980	We are talking about a territory that does not belong to Morocco , but that is being administrated by Morocco .
165.5666	Mr President , this is not the first time that the right to fish in Moroccan and Saharan waters has been an item on Parliament ' s agenda .
513.4133	Firstly , it must be emphasised that the fishing agreement with Morocco is by far the European Union ' s most important agreement , representing more than 30 % of all catches by the Community fleet in third-country waters .
233.8006	Mr President , Commissioner , I am not going to repeat what has been said this morning in this plenary sitting and has been being said for almost a year .
101.7168	Historically , it is neighbours that seem to have so much trouble with each other and the idea of the European Union is to resolve problematic relations with neighbours .
726.0298	I think that if we manage to persuade Morocco to take a European outlook , then Morocco will do what it should have done long ago , i.e. it will discuss the question of natural resources , of common resources with us and will stop giving preference to ships from third countries .
9.7669	Thank you , Commissioner .
25.2202	But it is not about language teachers ; it is all about an example , in this case about a citizens ' Europe .
148.1618	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the case of non-Italian foreign language assistants in Italian universities is well known in the Commission and in most European institutions .
5.7783	Each Member State is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service .
9.8265	What is this injustice ?
59.5116	Mr President , politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance , or how strong its moral base , there is no legal remedy .
676.6937	Nobody disputes that the Italian Republic is fully within its entitlement , in 1995 or at any other time , to say for the future we will not hire people as lettori , we will bring in people for a new kind of appointment .
37.2174	So far the European Commission has proven unwilling to enforce the Treaties when the number of people affected are few .
8.7563	We support the internal economic market .
130.4979	We are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the Court of Justice will give its opinion as soon as possible .
35.7663	This said , I hope that our debate will go some way to promoting an equitable solution for language teachers in Italy .
464.2792	Ladies and gentlemen , as you will be aware , last month saw the names of four more victims being added to the intolerable list of those who have lost their lives in Spain as a result of terrorist attacks by ETA .
25.9070	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
0.4605	Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral to committee ?
3.0750	It would therefore merely be a matter of bringing forward the vote .
9.2750	Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo , I would like to make sure I understand you correctly .
22.4558	I would appeal to everyone that you at least make sure you know what you are signing if you sign this petition .
81.7750	70 % of Irish lorries , Irish transporters , must go to , or through , the UK land bridge to Europe .
8770.2056	-LRB- A5-0313 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Marinho , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on money laundering , the identification , tracing , freezing , seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime -LSB- 10232/2000 - C5-0393 / 2000 - 2000/0814 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RSB- ,
146.0443	The fight against money laundering is , of course , one of the Union ' s most important priorities , as rightly identified at the Tampere Summit last year .
102.1872	In conclusion , Parliament has considered attentively and positively this Portuguese initiative but we are unsatisfied with the limited scope of the proposed revision of the Europol Convention .
198.5235	Article 6 , for its part , provides for the making of supplementary requests for mutual assistance , and Article 7 states that fiscal exceptions can no longer constitute a reason for refusing mutual assistance .
628.5999	As I have said , that is why I support the proposals on the table today but , at the same time , I would take this opportunity to give you advance notice that there will be a real battle with the Council over the common position on the second directive to combat money laundering .
759.1055	Were the European police force to be offered this heaven-sent chance of potential self-regulation , it would do its utmost to curb the European Parliament ' s vague desire for democratic control , given the current deficiencies at organisational level and the lack of unity on the background issues .
9.6001	I welcome this debate .
64.4225	It has to be by a majority vote - we propose two-thirds - and we also want parliamentary involvement in the dismissal of the director , if ever that becomes necessary , by a two-thirds vote as well .
4.1194	It would have full public support and it is necessary for the future .
1602.6208	What I should like to know is if there is a country in Europe or area in the world , such as the USA , which already has a single area of justice and which has effectively combated the problem of money laundering , or are we endeavouring , ostensibly in order to combat a real problem , to communitise crucial institutions which are bound up with the national independence and grass-roots sovereignty of the Member States ?
735.7580	This report includes a recital on the Geneva appeal , and the Group of the European People ' s Party will vote against it , not because we are against the Geneva appeal , but simply because as Parliament we must ensure the quality of legislation .
69.0690	However , we must not forget to provide Europol with sufficient staff and funding so that it is actually able to assume the responsibilities which we are assigning it .
209.1642	The aim of this framework decision is to combat the major crimes that are at the root of money laundering , not small crimes punishable by a lesser sentence , which , if considered within the scope of this framework decision , could negate its very purpose .
13.3495	This is where Member States , through police and judicial cooperation , can act most effectively to combat organised crime .
19.4092	To be frank , however , I do not think that this initiative is the appropriate occasion to be adopting decisions in this field .
0.2065	I may paint a gloomy picture , but we do have reason for hope .
14.0801	The Gebhardt report places special emphasis on these three points .
50.7479	The Member States of the European Community subscribe to these on the basis of their existing legislative , executive and legal systems , in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values .
1910.4849	Like Mrs Palacio , we hope that the provisional unit for judicial cooperation will soon cease to be provisional , but we Radical Members are not prepared to repeat our experience with Europol , when the establishment of the drugs unit led to the creation of a continually changing and expanding superbody which was out of the democratic control of national and European parliaments .
3.0000	It must be founded upon common values and have broad political support .
60.2911	Without a certain degree of cooperation , it is simply not possible for us to uphold a law-governed society in an EU with freedom of movement .
5.2282	Criminals must be left in no doubt as to this supranationality .
19.2513	The Commission welcomes your report , Mrs Gebhardt .
23.0321	Part of this is , of course , also ex post evaluation , even if , in this case , it has definitely come rather late .
231.9959	I nonetheless assume , not least with a view to my hobbyhorse of fisheries , that we will put pressure on all three of them together so that we can guarantee positive developments in the future .
603.3413	It is sufficient to suggest that we need to look at the whole procedure again , not just in terms of the Court ' s annual report which will be published tomorrow , but also in terms of special reports such as this one .
94.6380	I should just like to touch on a few points which are , in my opinion , decisive for the future work of monitoring research in general .
0.2420	I must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected .
793.5502	I would nevertheless like to stress one thing , which is that joint financial responsibility can not , in a strict sense , be envisaged within the context of the framework programme , the aim of which is to set up consortia composed of various bodies , universities , SMEs , large companies , and public or private research institutes .
61.0252	The process is therefore under way , but we are now entering the domain of Member State jurisdiction and can not always dictate how long things will take .
25.9070	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
143.2010	Madam President , as a member of the European Parliament from Salzburg , allow me to start by thanking you for your words of acknowledgement and comfort yesterday .
100.0971	This Charter will , I think , need to be supplemented in the future , if it is to become the foundation stone of a European constitution .
41.7549	This is quite clearly a major political decision and a fresh opportunity to show the citizens of Europe the whole scope of this initiative .
11.9834	So , the Charter is a perfectly consistent text .
5.7148	I am sure the Convention members that are to speak here will be able to confirm that .
5477.2990	I clearly heard your rapporteurs once again expressing the desire to see the Charter form the preamble to a constitutional treaty and you know that I , personally , am in favour of this , but I should like to point out , because we are bound to be extremely precise regarding what is happening today , that the European Council in Biarritz was forced to note that the majority of Member States were not willing to discuss the matter of incorporating this Charter into the Treaties , at least for the time being .
161.0777	I should like on behalf of our group to offer express thanks not only to all the members of our group but , most of all , to Vice-President Ingo Friedrich , who coordinated our work .
11.3682	The European Union has long been more than an economic community .
8.7263	This is our proposal .
3.7107	It took many weeks of battling to incorporate the right to strike into the Charter .
11.0741	Secondly , because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the Union .
319.5307	Therefore , we feel that the Charter is only important as a position of principle , as a starting point for a debate : a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop , which must take place alongside the unification process .
297.5626	Behind the vote on the Charter , there is an ill-concealed agenda to create the first part of a constitution for what might be called a United States of Europe .
37.8314	And we want a Europe which blossoms , prospers and grows , which is why we wanted and were right to refer to our roots .
6.6628	Let me briefly discuss the scope of the text .
47.4221	Such respect , combined with a ban on discrimination , creates a basis for securing the position of minorities in the future .
9.0485	Nothing in life is perfect and it is also not perfect to declare rights but not uphold them effectively .
7.0650	It is never too late to set things right .
666.8393	I feel that the present Charter is nothing but a poor imitation in that it raises legal concerns such as the point in Article 2 , Paragraph 2 , where it states `` No one shall be condemned to the death penalty , or executed '' .
370.5384	Just one last word to the President-in-Office : as a former member of a supreme court , I can assure you that if the jurisdiction of various supreme courts overlaps , this will quickly give rise to diverging case law and diverging case law is only to be expected .
144.6193	I think that the reference to Article 6 is logical and I think that the President-in-Office of the Council should take note of what Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo said .
88.4608	If you think of the fragile political situation in one or two of our Member States , that is an important message to be setting out at this time .
109.8162	This Charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the Member States and , thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws , it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness .
50.6660	Mr President , the Charter gives visible form to existing rights , at the same time as historical steps are being taken on behalf of Europe .
12.4826	Mr President , the proposal and adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights should meet with very broad consensus .
48.2137	Attaque also notes that it ignores trade union rights and that , in actual fact , it is about establishing the free movement of capital .
44.0285	In this way , the Charter provides additional protection for the most vulnerable members of Europe ' s society , and that is to be welcomed .
8.7350	For a start , they must incorporate an amendment to Article 6 of the EU Treaty .
267.7320	The debate as to whether the Union should not simply accede to the European Convention on Human Rights just as the Member States do has gone on for years .
316.8997	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Charter which we are preparing to vote upon today with Europeanist conviction is certainly a step forward towards the political integration of Europe , in which we firmly believe .
5.5049	It is important that these two bodies should not lose their authority .
466.4038	My fellow members on the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms , and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs did me the honour of appointing me rapporteur on the issue of respect for human rights within the Europe Union .
39.9934	The Charter has many supporters but also many enemies , and we have heard the opinions of those who do not want a political Europe .
69.1486	Some find the text excessively binding , even too advanced in relation to a number of reforms which it would be liable to dismantle , while others find it devoid of content or not sufficiently binding .
780.1361	Let me remind you that ETUC , for example , representing 60 million employees in Europe , was consulted , that several hundred NGOs were consulted , that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the Convention .
21.6034	The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
2753.1403	The European Parliament will have to tell its Turkish partners very clearly in the debates in that Forum that they need have no fear of any European desire to interfere in their internal affairs and that , on the contrary , it is proposing a contract , the precise details of which are being thrashed out , in the accession partnership , Commissioner , and , of course , in the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
45.4981	If we had wanted to impose conditions they would have had to be imposed last year when the earlier decision was adopted .
375.8579	I feel that Mr Morillon ' s excellent report bears witness to your determination to bring Turkey ' s pre-accession process to a successful conclusion , while exercising the utmost vigilance , quite legitimately , regarding the still considerable reforms which this country has yet to undertake .
5738.8269	Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr SeppÃ $ nen for their highly constructive and politically intelligent reports and to say that this debate is taking place at a most auspicious time , a time when we are in a position to set relations between the European Union and Turkey on what may prove to be a decisive course .
544.6646	I agree : we should be worried that there is too little respect for human rights and the rights of minorities , we should be worried about the constitutional role of the army and we are still extremely worried about the situation of the population of Kurdish origin and about the state of emergency in the four remaining provinces in the south-east .
3.2238	Here too , I agree in the main with Mr Morillon 's report .
2738.1166	Given that this special programme of EUR 450 million , of which the European Union is guaranteeing 65 % , specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only EUR 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund , there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default , because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in .
38.6266	At a meeting which I , unfortunately , was unable to attend , my group decided by a majority to support Amendment No 25 .
13.7622	The Morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the European Union to Turkey 's candidature .
159.8081	In other words , I propose that the European Parliament should itself hold a debate on the Armenian genocide , the majority will follow on and we shall continue the debate in Turkey .
30.1469	Anything else would simply play into the hands of those in the EU and in Turkey who oppose this membership .
54.9653	Mr President , the Morillon report in itself provides a perfect illustration of the basic contradictions in the European attitude to Turkey .
179.4266	Incidentally , the ultranationalist MHP party was in deadly earnest when it underlined ` the superiority of the Turkish race ' at its party conference ten days ago .
6477.8170	Report -LRB- A5-0279 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs Paciotti , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the institutions and bodies of the Community and on the free movement of such data -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 337 - C5-0149 / 2000 - 1999/0153 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RRB-
924.7220	I would stress that in entrusting this huge power of monitoring the European databases to a monocratic body - notwithstanding the total respect and confidence which we have in the Guarantor - we would appear to have momentarily shifted our focus from the central concern of the human person which , in respect of the power of information technology , must be provided with a reference framework of guaranteed rights and freedoms .
885.1108	And yet there is a need for a set of data protection rules , for the institutions not only process internal data -LRB- such as data relating to their autonomous activities , budget and staff reports -RRB- but also data collected from citizens in the performance of EU duties -LRB- e.g. granting subsidies , investigating competition cases , public tenders , statistical research and studies , data relating to the preparation and implementation of legislation -RRB- .
670.3712	The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a far cry from the Declaration of Human Rights of the UN , the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutions of many Member States of the European Union .
16.7411	The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against this text , which is both useless and dangerous .
10.2932	Articles establishing new obligations without justification .
10.9550	. SOS Democracy rejects the Charter of Fundamental Rights on three grounds .
202.9280	Of greatest concern is Article 52 , which provides for the rights referred to elsewhere in the document to be set aside where they conflict with the `` general interest recognised by the Union '' .
27.9726	This is the way in which it will gradually pervade , through case law , all our national and European legal systems !
27.5338	Furthermore , I would have preferred a Charter that did not merely stipulate the ` rights ' of citizens but also their ` duties ' towards society .
69.7347	Everyday topical events , from maritime transport to animal meal , show us that the markets and economic operators must be much better regulated and controlled and that established short-term profit-making interests must be opposed .
190.5757	Given that only have two options , my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this Charter represents , however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text .
26.5624	The difference between not prohibiting access to work and taking action to make it possible to work is more than just a shade of meaning .
15.7954	Nonetheless , it does not substantiate the EU 's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens .
121.5528	In this catalogue of rights , the devotees of European federalism see the embryo of a future European Constitution , which the Member States ' national constitutions will have to accommodate .
8.6847	From start to finish , the framing of the Charter gave rise to a series of takeovers by force :
11.3934	The lot of processes of this nature is to produce texts which necessarily boil down to the lowest common denominator .
13.3245	The arguments put forward by the European Parliament are completely fallacious .
57.2094	In any case , the fight against money laundering takes place on a number of levels and , to start with , we see no need to establish maximum and minimum penalties for this at Community level .
5.6390	Yet they clearly run counter to the interests of human beings and the conservation of our environment .
0.4698	This will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across Europe .
10.8329	There you are . This is an example of what I hope will not happen when this document is implemented .
31.1719	Gebhardt Report -LRB- A5-0317 / 2000 -RRB-
8.4101	-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 12.52 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. -RRB-
11.0927	Turkey has not come so far as had been hoped .
178.2777	The residual guarantee fund reserve is now so low that it may prevent the Union from using the EIB as an instrument if new events should occur , requiring initiatives of this nature .
83.9171	This is the first serious step on the road towards Turkey 's accession and the accession process can now move into the practical application stage .
3.1924	Until that happens I do not think this Parliament should act differently .
13.2300	Turkey must come to terms with the truth .
49.1518	As far as the Armenian genocide is concerned I fully agree that it should not be a precondition to Turkey 's accession .
214.4602	Our rapporteur , Mr Morillon , deserves our congratulations for stipulating that a solution to the Cyprus problem must be one of the preconditions for Turkey ' s accession .
709.6726	There are also positive references to Cyprus , with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn , to the need to implement the decisions of the European court , as in the LoÃ ¯ zidou case , to the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question and to the bombings in Iraq .
13.1681	This , it seems to me , is precisely the balance advocated by Mr Morillon ' s report .
12.4992	It is not my place to give Parliament advice or to criticise - nor shall I do so .
2092.9681	I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing me to give an assessment of the current state of the European Union ' s Mediterranean policy since this is , as you know , the eve of the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers from the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership , which is to be held in Marseilles .
22.1462	Indeed , when we instigated the partnership in 1995 , we were aware that we were undertaking a long-term project .
20.5929	Mr Brok mentioned financial resources .
18.4679	Mr President , it is a sign of the President-in-Office 's competence that he has answered questions which I have not even asked .
331.9093	We should try and help to give the people of Palestine the chance to decide their own fate , forge their own future and build their own state on the basis of agreement with and the security of the state of Israel .
300.3877	We in fact completed our negotiations with Egypt almost 18 months ago and I wish that we could now rapidly proceed to initialling the agreement and then in due course to full signature .
1521.3675	In the next few years the success of that partnership will be even more important than ever and I hope that , at Marseilles this week and in subsequent weeks , we manage to ensure that this whole enterprise has even more impulse and energy in it than it has had in the past .
300.7021	In fact , we observe that the still-prevailing bilateral dimension , which is anything but easy to negotiate and takes a long time to ratify , is in danger of increasingly shaping the economies of these countries on the basis of their trade with the Union , hampering the development of the south-south dimension , especially because of the partner countries ' difficulty in establishing mutual cooperative relations .
1144.5866	A few days ago , in Barcelona , at various meetings of the CÃrculo de EconomÃa , the Secretary General of the Council , Mr Solana , told us that the priorities for European external activity are firstly with our neighbours , and our closest neighbours are the Mediterraneans .
138.0613	Next , we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions , but also environmental protection , the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking , emigration and integration , and to make progress towards human rights , as we have requested .
7.9376	-LRB- The President cut the speaker off -RRB-
186.7083	With these conditions in place , it should be possible for the special council in Marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the EU .
16.5424	If current tendencies continue we can be pessimistic about the future .
1468.9439	Mr President , I will come back to the conflict in the Middle East ; not two months ago , the Presidents of the Israeli Parliament and the Palestinian Assembly united in this House with the President of the European Parliament , in a plea for peace and harmony , and we all joined in hearty applause for that gesture .
224.1978	Marseilles too , the other summit , brought together the members of associations , trade unions and political bodies from all around the Mediterranean , and these people were together attempting resolutely to find solutions to meeting the needs of their peoples .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
3.3769	However , there are two key aspects of policy I would like to focus on .
21.0340	In quite concrete terms , this means reducing the influence of the Governing Board associated with the agency .
146.2596	It is vital that NGOs should collaborate in this field , and also that there should be some coordination among them , if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions .
6122.6744	At the same time , in order to include a specifically cultural angle , not in abstract or generic terms but in terms of solidarity , we have proposed amendments which have found favour in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and which , I feel , contribute to providing , on the one hand , economic , civil , supportive assistance while restoring the civil society of these very unfortunate areas and , on the other , the possibility for cultural and institutional - and I stress the word institutional - support , to give these areas a sense of association with Europe , association in terms of civilisation , in terms of cultural initiatives , as well .
79.6805	I also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members , where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time , should be avoided .
369.2144	A great deal of headway has been made in the space of a year and the internal dynamics in a number of countries are at long last enhancing the role of the international community , even though the Kosovo crisis is still fresh in the memory .
7.9260	Their political fate will also depend on how successfully the EU is able to deliver aid .
299.2648	To this end we have set two aims ; the first is to develop regional cooperation , and the second is to implement a genuine policy to encourage a rapprochement between these countries and the European Union .
15.0704	We would like to see the programmes assigned to it by the Commission implemented more efficiently and speedily .
8.3596	He has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region .
1827.8664	During the European Council , within the framework of the report on the development of European facilities for military and civilian crisis management , it was suggested that rapid financing mechanisms , such as the creation by the Commission of a rapid reaction fund , should be set up to speed up the provision of finance to support European Union activities , to contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund NGO activities , where appropriate .
172.2411	The constant postponement of the referendum , and the failure of negotiations in Berlin on 28 September 2000 , are raising serious concerns and engendering deep disappointment among the people .
62.8058	Whatever the result of the referendum - independence or annexation to Morocco - it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively .
5531.0836	The transport of radioactive materials in France is carried out in accordance with the legislation in force and , in particular , Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , and Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail , which apply to the transport of radioactive materials and set out various technical requirements in relation to vehicles , brands and packing .
135.0928	The European Union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries .
578.6888	The European Council in Feira last June called upon the Council to speed up the implementation of measures combating illegal rings , provided for in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999 .
241.2082	Mr Martin is right , as we are indeed concerned with fighting criminal organisations involved in the trafficking of human beings and not reviewing previous texts that enable potential refugees to exercise their right to seek asylum on Union territory .
20.5752	However , these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the Council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances .
64.5513	Not this evening , and here I come to my answer , as I know the Minister and I can give you the Council ' s response .
119.0443	The term of the Head of State and President of the Republic , Jacques Chirac , will , of course , come to an end at Vienna , this is clear .
172.6944	Having said that , I should like to make it clear , Mrs Flemming , that , in general , I like Austria and Austrian people .
713.6076	Will the Council give its response to the assertion in Mr Cem 's letter that in the partnership agreement there can be no link-up between the Cyprus problem and EU-Turkey relations and that such a link-up would constitute a violation of the terms of the Helsinki conclusions ?
268.7272	The situation , and I should like a response to it from the minister , is this : First , the Helsinki conclusions state that resolving the Cyprus problem is not a precondition to the accession of Cyprus .
49.4490	The agreement will also take into consideration the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector .
309.8493	The agreement they propose is for two years instead of five , and in addition they want the European Union to pay them the ESP 21 billion that it is currently paying .
24.8560	Question No 13 by -LRB- H-0854 / 00 -RRB- :
117.0683	Mr President , my point of order is that there remain twenty minutes of Question Time , there are very few Members in the House and there is no risk of exceeding time .
25.4271	As to energy efficiency , the Commission presented an action plan during last May ' s Council meeting .
2006.1017	The objective of the European Union regarding Cuba , as established in the common position on Cuba adopted by the Council on 2 December 1996 , is to encourage a process of peaceful `` transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .
5253.5501	Subject : Violation by Turkey of sovereign rights within NATO Turkey has , de facto , challenged the sovereign rights of Greece by intercepting Greek aircraft taking part in NATO 's exercise , Destined Glory , its failure to respect the Greek ten-mile FIR and the air corridors over the islands of Limnos and Ikaria , ignoring the opinions of NATO 's legal service , and departing from the plans for the exercise drawn up by NATO 's administration , which prompted the Greek Government to withdraw its troops .
22.9083	I do not know if it was to everyone ' s satisfaction , but it is an almost historic event of which we take good note .
75.2849	Commissioner and the few honourable Members who have found their way here , I must , of course , start by congratulating the rapporteurs on their work and excellent cooperation , especially the rapporteur who is here in the House .
0.1899	But where there is no will , nor should there be money from us .
1.7985	They create a framework for political initiatives which must be built up into new perceptions .
9.0642	The Member States make grandiose declarations of their intentions but these must be followed by a concrete financial undertaking .
105.0955	These two proposals respond to two key Union priorities : providing assistance to southeastern Europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible .
3.0647	These are the results of which the European Parliament too can be proud .
3684.3497	To be clear : we can accept the spirit , provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording , of Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , the first part of 11 , the first part of 13 , 16 partially , 17 , 18 , 19 partially and 20 , 21 , 24 , 28 in the first part , 31 and partially 37 .
10.8825	Thank you Commissioner .
33.1832	They pledged to promote and protect fundamental human rights and uphold respect for democracy , the rule of law , equality , justice and concern for the environment .
10.2433	Finally , leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework .
53.6097	It is good - I freely admit - that some agreement was reached on a framework programme for cooperation between Asia and Europe .
11.8919	We find it incomprehensible that the secretariat for the fellowship programme is to be located in Seoul .
106.2509	This monitoring should be transferred to an unequivocally Community body , so that the common fisheries policy can apply to all Member States and to all vessels and crews regardless of their nationality , thus avoiding any possible breach of the principle of equal treatment .
2925.5986	It would mean , first of all , not having to confine itself to reacting to actions like that of the Galapagos Agreement and its manifest intention of unilaterally extending the jurisdictional waters of four countries in defiance of the basic norms of international maritime law , or against attempts to arbitrarily expel Community fleets , which are among the few that are governed by strict standards and regulations .
3.5379	The development of a regionalisation of the CFP will be critical in ensuring local action .
47.4926	We are backing the regional fisheries organisations ; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the Commission to have more weight in them .
1.7058	This is an extremely difficult position to have to try to find a way through .
80.0026	The Commission therefore stands by its conclusion in the communication that , as far as controls are concerned , NAFO is an exceptional case and should not become the rule .
17.6443	COM in pigmeat
3.7326	Accordingly , the Commission has proposed incorporating a new tool into the COM : regulatory funds .
18.8242	The last one caused prices to fall by over 30 % from mid-1998 to early 2000 .
350.8144	The fact is that the pigfarming sector has been the only sector which has until now been able to compete on market conditions with just a relatively few forms of intervention such as export subsidies and private storage , and it must continue to do so .
11.4149	This is a model just like the American model .
5.1097	This is an honest and credible endeavour and I shall recommend that my group vote in favour .
972.5030	In this way , far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice , with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving , at reasonable cost , towards what is practised in certain third countries , such as the insurance-cum-income systems in force in the United States and Canada .
74.8265	The way I understand it is that voluntary funds in the future will help to ensure there is also balanced marketing in the pig industry .
53.3669	Mr President , the really positive thing about this debate is that we are getting a very clear idea of what can be regulated within the common agricultural policy and what can not .
34.9893	It is clear from market developments that , as ever , the pig cycle is exerting its influence and still applies and that good times will again follow bad .
52.9356	More importantly , we must not forget that in numerous countries farmers fatten their piglets themselves and hence have direct access to the compensation fund via the fattened pigs which they sell .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
208.0126	Since the last discharge procedure the Court has adopted 24 special reports containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community 's financial management can be improved .
1.4583	This reflection leads me to some comments on the reform of the Commission .
96.9834	The Court of Auditors quite rightly applies very high standards to the way tax-payers ' money is used , and the Commission is following these high standards in its own financial management reform .
241.9806	It is , of course , emphasised that it is the European Commission 's job both to avoid formal errors and to combat fraud , especially as people keep asking where the dividing lines lie and where things blend together .
20.7988	Mrs Schreyer 's report was just as interesting .
118.5538	A solution needs to be found here , and I would like to ask you , Mrs Schreyer , if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged .
5.1106	We are told that this can not be properly calculated .
28.7256	Once and for all , we can say : ` Here are the problem areas , and we want to find solutions ' .
236.9627	The Member States avoid responsibility , misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and , every time criticisms are made , a storm of criticism rains down upon those in Brussels , that is to say the Commission and others .
114.0523	I also call upon the Ministers , Heads of State and Government to endorse the proposal for a European Public Ministry at the Nice Summit .
20.4728	Proper management and control procedures , lack of planning , inadequate evaluations , loose or non-existent eligibility criteria frequently feature in this report .
25.9122	I should be grateful if the Court would issue its opinion on the reform of the Financial Regulation soon .
68.4777	But I find that the work of the Court of Auditors has not been done sufficiently well to help us to do our job .
8.5726	The whole process will take time .
724.9355	This headline relates to a press conference by Mr Friedmann , and I must ask , Mr Karlsson , why Members of the Court of Auditors are making different statements , first in our Committee on Budgetary Control and then apparently to the press .
179.7096	I would like to congratulate the Commission , and Commissioner Schreyer in particular , on the Court 's observation that many of the changes it has requested are being implemented or are on the way to being implemented .
91.6350	Finally , Mr Karlsson , while we , as a Parliament , make all these changes , perhaps you could go and help America count its votes !
143.8647	The Court of Auditors was asked - and a number of speakers have reminded us of this morning - to explicitly name the Member States in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered .
326.8779	These are excellent , high-quality documents , which are a `` drop in the ocean '' in a common agricultural policy that still gives special treatment to larger farmers at the expense of the smaller ones and to countries and regions at the heart of Europe at the expense of peripheral countries and regions .
10.0363	I am extremely happy .
319.6606	It was quite clear , in this particular case , that the Court of First Instance supported us by saying we not only have the right to mention these names but also a duty to do so .
22.9265	Thank you very much , Mr Karlsson .
37.1597	Another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow-up services .
963.1347	For this simple reason we have expressed a different viewpoint , and we can only advise this Chamber , on behalf of a majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , to accept Amendments Nos 38 or 41 in particular , as these relate to a weakening of export bans .
22.9618	For example , in many sectors , products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer , with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers .
548.9175	In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , under the wise guidance of our rapporteur , we passed a series of amendments which , again , my group would commend en bloc to the House today .
10.5360	Our Amendments Nos 1 , 8 and 18 bear on that point .
124.4341	There is a proposal to scrap this idea , one of the considerations being that producers should not have to incriminate themselves , and also in the light of professional secrecy .
0.2214	By its very nature , the service industry is less suited to this approach .
53.1425	Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her work , which addresses the fundamental concerns of consumers ' associations , which must be accepted as equal partners in a constructive dialogue .
0.2034	In other sectors , this directive has been extended to other fields of application .
97.2171	Although the review and revision of the directive are formally required by the directive itself , this coincides with the reinforced commitment by the Commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers .
47.5574	This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors and especially with imported products .
65.6927	The only new requirement is that distributors , within the limits of their respective activities , are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tracing the origin of products .
8.8671	Amendment No 7 proposes certain changes in the references to paragraphs .
20.7324	These are civil law aspects , regulated by the directive on product liability , and should not , therefore , be dealt with here .
12.9503	This is not acceptable , as these directives often lack provisions on market surveillance , notification systems and so on .
3.3911	That is not acceptable as this is a key improvement in comparison to the existing directive .
863.0093	On 30 June 2000 , at the end of a meeting of the Bureau , of which I was a member but where a few close colleagues discussed my case , in my absence and without my knowledge , Mr BarÃ ³ n Crespo informed me that I had excluded myself from his group .
19.3421	-LRB- Parliament adopted the legislative resolution -RRB-
168.5708	The first one was from Mr Katiforis about the word NATO , and the second question was about whether the present order is correct as shown .
45.9993	- -LRB- EL -RRB- The Mediterranean has always been , and still is , a particularly sensitive region with serious political , economic and social problems .
5.7265	The question of financing also requires a will to succeed which has thus far not been displayed .
283.8226	Mr President , despite the progress made in recent years within the European Union , within this Europe that champions human rights , structural discrimination on the grounds of sex still exists .
7.5872	The only reason why it is becoming widespread is the desire of companies to make ever greater profits .
0.2190	Furthermore , I think that a `` media code of conduct '' is impractical .
47.3228	As I left , I said to her , `` Do n't worry : we are going to debate the GonzÃ ¡ lez Ã  lvarez report which deals precisely with product safety '' .
137.0856	Let us not forget that it was my Labour colleague , Mr Whitehead , who introduced the amendments exempting charity shops , and we should congratulate him on his achievements .
70.5225	Amendment No 14 weakens the Governing Board vis-Ã - vis the Commission , by stipulating that its decisions are adopted by simple majority .
357.3432	- -LRB- EL -RRB- The remit of the European Agency for Reconstruction should have been extended to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a long time ago and should not be linked to the internal changes in Yugoslavia .
6.0688	Parliament ' s report will introduce still more aid schemes .
4.5895	We do not have a market organisation for pigmeat comparable with those for other agricultural products .
1.9400	There is no point in setting up funds to ameliorate the effects of recurring crises .
5.8205	This goes to show that one disaster can trigger off the next .
1138.2227	European governments do not want to offend Turkish reactionaries who refuse to abolish the death penalty and trample women ' s rights underfoot . Nor do they want to offend the Turkish authorities who now oppress the Kurdish people after having already massacred the Armenian population .
3.4159	The progress reports established by the European Commission are therefore extremely important .
6.6138	I voted for this motion for a resolution .
198.7407	Sadly , many issues are still unresolved such as those related to the Kurdish and Armenian situations and to full respect for civil rights , although a great deal of progress has been made in these fields .
243.9972	Nonetheless , the system that has been put in place will do its work and will impose its logic on us until the time comes when this awkward position will become so untenable that our relations with Turkey will be in serious and deep crisis .
16.3845	Mr President , as you are aware , the news is spreading throughout the world of fish that I am promoting their cause .
18.5062	The rapporteur 's answer is for the Community to be given the resources , effectively , to take direct control over fisheries monitoring .
3.1693	Some Member States are not at all involved in certain fishing regions .
18.9713	The need for conciliation soon became apparent because , as it turned out , the Council was not minded to adopt these amendments .
358.0954	Mr President , I share at least one certainty with the rapporteur , Mr Blokland : incineration may be a significant source of pollution but it is in fact necessary today , given the very low levels of waste recycling .
312.0789	First and foremost , a significant contribution has now been made to reducing discharges of hazardous and polluting substances produced by incineration - substances which are very harmful to people ' s health and which damage the environment .
37.3577	In some countries the best alternative , environmentally speaking , is that carefully sorted combustible waste can be burned in small municipal plants that produce electricity and heating .
83.3781	In particular , I welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on incineration plants and the obligation on plant operators to publish an annual report on emissions .
297.6350	The work of the countries to hold the presidency , Portugal and France , was constructive , and we have to mention in particular the role of the Commission , which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result .
195.1424	Burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste , due to the waste hierarchy , and the Commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy .
85.1591	The Employment and Social Policy Council adopted a European strategy for the fight against social exclusion in Luxembourg on 17 October .
1229.6940	However , they are also needed in order to compensate for the increasing shortcomings of national health services as the result of public-sector management , high costs and cutbacks in expenditure by governments , expenditure which has steadily decreased in all the Member States during the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s .
346.6294	That is precisely why it is so important - and in fact this is far and away the most significant achievement of this report - for the Commission to produce a Green Paper on supplementary health insurance in the short term .
10.1960	The debate on health insurance in the EU must not end up going down a blind alley .
44.7648	According to this concept , the purpose of the market in profit-making supplementary health insurance schemes is to increasingly and crucially take on the role of supplementing the basic state systems .
100.3883	It is , of course , the same doctor , the same nurses , the same hospitals and the same resources in the health care sector which are to be used , irrespective of whether it is ordinary or private patients who are being treated .
14.8819	My sincere congratulations go to the rapporteur , Michel Rocard .
18.6580	The national insurance system is not subject to the coordination rules because it is not employees ' insurance and only applies to nationals .
9.6156	We reject this socially unacceptable reform .
14.7260	Health care is financed in different ways in different Member States and the roles of private health insurers are correspondingly different .
1762.0293	Articles 34 and 35 of our fledgling European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognise and respect the entitlement to social security benefits and social services and , at the same time , proclaim the entitlement of everyone residing and moving legally within the Union to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices .
19.1641	Financing statutory health care and pension schemes is at the heart of the social and budgetary debate in Europe .
9.6878	This is an upwards trend owing to the reorganisation of the social security systems in certain Member States .
12.7272	Today 's Green Paper becomes tomorrow 's intrusive and damaging legislation .
4.6432	The Commission will immediately launch a study of supplementary health insurance .
338.2675	I thank you for your understanding during this procedure , which means that we are able to contribute to the European Union once again having a programme in this field , despite its limitations and shortcomings .
4.1989	They should be enabled to gain and update qualifications and skills .
68.7404	The countries outside the euro area present their convergence programmes , which to a great extent resemble the stability programmes , although the objectives to be achieved are different .
85.6046	Finally , we shall assess to what extent the national budgets presented each year are compatible with more ambitious medium-term strategies for public finances .
26.7362	In the case of Finland , the national debt is already much lower than this target and is falling all the time .
350.9840	First of all , the proceeds of the UMTS licences , as I said before , have been allocated to reducing the debt , so that the national debt is now practically down to the 60 % level .
3.8134	There is no doubt at all that inflation is a worry .
35.0761	At the moment the impression I have is that the formulas being used in the various Member States are moving in three directions .
31.8698	This action plan places public health and transparency at the top of the agenda , this being a requirement of the French Government .
80.4578	This meeting will compare experiences and approaches with regard to the test programme , the ban on animal meal and other measures that might be reinforced at a European level .
208.4300	There has been a worrying increase in the number of cases of BSE detected in France over the past year , in part due to the introduction of targeted testing .
212.5215	Finally , we must not overlook the huge progress in recent years , in the past year in particular , in putting in place a framework to tackle BSE .
64.7058	The European Parliament has been a consistent and strong supporter of such testing and I count on your support for the Commission 's approach .
1.7659	Public health and financial considerations , therefore , both argue for strict implementation .
23.8030	My only concern in relation to the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether it is safe or not to use in animal feed .
0.4061	It remains to be seen if this changes in the light of current events .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
49.6029	Madam President , I would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this House , because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later !
17.9068	In certain circumstances , it is necessary to slaughter the entire stock of animals , which must come as a real blow .
81.7206	The grass in our meadows , white clover and vetch - currently neglected by the CAP - may provide satisfactory solutions for the safety of animal feed and human food .
0.2327	Selective aid , such as market support and a grass subsidy , are essential .
36.9840	The scientific authorities clearly stated that the development of the disease in cattle was not under control and they pinpointed the alarming growth in the numbers of animals affected .
8.3243	Just now , I heard reference being made to random tests .
32.7918	-LRB- Applause from the UEN Group -RRB-
10.7524	Although a French action , it has widespread international implications .
6.3881	The health of European consumers must be a top priority in all decisions that are adopted .
109.3685	There is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals . Why should it cover pigs , poultry and fish , as some Member States and some Members here have been demanding ?
76.2359	Madam President , I would advise the Commission not to be so sure of itself or , more importantly , of its forecasts for the future .
1426.1500	Yesterday , the coordinators of the various parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development lent their support to the proposal to earmark EUR 600 million of the EUR 1.3 billion still available in the agricultural budget for the fight against BSE .
544.4344	There is a general acknowledgement that BSE , which began as a British disease and today is being presented as a French crisis , is really a European disease - a European problem - and it must be tackled on that basis .
72.2673	We must take precautions now , not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned , but on behalf of the complacent minority of Member States as well .
56.2386	In the future , when these MBMs are banned , we are going to need millions of additional hectares of oil seed crops .
10.6799	I have worked out the cost - 10 cents per kilo .
1.8662	This amounts to deliberately putting consumers at risk and , as such , is unacceptable .
3.0490	Parliament has voted half the budget to be spent on encouraging production .
13.3637	What is more , this regulation is continually tightened up and complies with requirements made at European level .
30.0819	However , we have learnt a great deal over the years as to how to put our house in order .
75.2672	France has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many French provinces have stopped school children from consuming home-grown beef .
101.4065	I believe that we must now try , following your debates , to define the key ways , in terms of both method and means , in order to ensure compliance with this imperative .
38.6528	We are talking about public health , and hence of serious events , which must be treated as such , in a strict and , of course , transparent manner .
174.2734	I believe that there has been compliance with the legislation and if I believe that - and I do not think I am being naÃ ¯ ve - I do not believe that it is essential to have a widespread ban on meat-and-bone meal to be fed to pigs and poultry .
349.2843	Mr Martinez took part in the first one , and right here I have , if my fellow Member would care to consult it , his minority opinion , which was expressed in writing at the time of the BÃ ¶ ge committee .
11.8071	In the later , more long-term stage , the objective will be to define a fully comprehensive common asylum system .
267.0631	On 12 December in Palermo , the United Nations is going to sign the World Convention on Organised Crime with a protocol on the traffic in human beings .
2063.0338	The programme presented by the Commission on the question of gender equality for the next five years contains five priorities , one of which concerns violence and human rights and we expect to work with governments , local authorities and non-governmental organisations here in order to put programmes in place in all the Member States over the next five years .
10.3723	As a result of the stability and growth plan , however , we have also launched the so-called stability programmes .
377.7105	From an external viewpoint , it is true there is a problem - and indirectly I am answering Mr Nogueira - which is , we must not forget , that savings in Europe are much greater than in the United States .
0.2495	During the measurement campaign elevated levels of sulphur dioxide were observed in some hot-spots .
12.2150	Questions Nos 25 to 28 will be replied to in writing .
8.2980	That concludes Questions to the Commission .
157.8514	Following the mass unemployment of the 1980s , social exclusion risks becoming the new evil which will gnaw away at Europe over the coming decade .
36.8692	This will form the background against which we shall acquire a more common framework of understanding , for the concept of social exclusion is not so simple to define .
60.9362	It would be useful to use some of the increased sum which is requested in this report to fund comparative studies to demonstrate how such developments might be managed .
13.7442	I believe , however , that social exclusion and poverty are caused by social conditions and that responsibility is therefore shared .
43.0502	If we are to achieve the economic and social cohesion to which we aspire we need not just a high level of employment , but also a high level of social protection .
26.7846	The simple fact is that social exclusion is a brake on economic growth , while an inclusive society enhances growth and the well-being of everyone .
2.9449	Naturally , labour market policy is part and parcel of this issue .
202.9775	Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent contribution to identifying the causes and the scale of poverty , which is an appropriate term for a social reality whose cruelty should not be watered down into a concept as wide-ranging and abstract as social exclusion .
109.8741	The proposed action programme has a legal basis , Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , and we had a new mandate after the Lisbon Council .
46.8447	But I agree that `` poverty '' is politically a very strong word and I agree that we can add poverty to social exclusion where possible in the text of the proposal .
20.9013	Finally , I would like to respond to your concerns about the involvement of different actors and institutions in the implementation of this programme .
105.9350	The proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the European Union 's strategy to double the share of renewables in energy consumption by 2010 .
187.6129	This makes it possible for Member States to determine the exact level of their respective contributions to meeting the EU 's target , in accordance with the principles of burden sharing , and , in this area , also the sharing of opportunities .
18.8728	This is a summit which intends to slow down climate change and at which the Kyoto Protocol will undergo its ordeal by fire .
6.7168	Renewable energy is by far the largest source of energy currently in use in the world .
14.1199	As I see it though , these subsidies should be no more than reasonable and only payable for a limited period .
51.3652	That is what politics is all about : making competition possible between the two instruments by protecting guaranteed prices and harmonising certificate-related issues .
29.1404	Hence my amendment to maintain the strict emission standards of Annex 5 of the revised directive for waste incineration .
4.2382	Many of us feel that energy from waste should be included .
78.8242	I think we not only need to develop renewable energy sources but a modern energy savings programme to run in parallel with that process , as this dependence is also starting to become a matter of security for us .
35.2757	Also , I would like to inform the Commissioner that Ireland can be competitive in wind energy in a very short time .
3.7897	The debate on renewable energy sources must not become a form of populism against nuclear energy .
0.2141	We need commitment from the government if we are to get the funding together .
9.5301	Renewable energy is no exception .
8.7067	This is what we must do at a European level .
461.1647	Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Rothe on the magnificent work she has carried out , as well as all the Members who have spoken and who have , on many occasions , tabled amendments to the text proposed to Parliament and the Council .
238.8573	The Commission rejects this part of Amendment No 27 , Amendments Nos 11 , 54 , 55 , 61 and Amendment No 57 , which are all related to it .
1737.7493	With regard to the principles on which the future harmonised support system must be based , the Commission can accept the parts of Amendments Nos 37 and 38 which stipulate that such a system must take account of the environmental objectives of the Treaty , the experience acquired with the support systems , which have proven to be effective and positive , as well as geographical conditions .
5.0445	Those widowed by conflicts are forced to bring up children and look after the elderly by themselves .
5.4824	Local participation in the peace and reconciliation processes is important .
13.5038	Preventative measures are needed , including the provision of special protection for women in refugee camps by segregating said camps .
789.9357	Finally , Mr President , I wish to express my disappointment at what I see as shifty manoeuvres that have lead to the watering down of Paragraph 12 concerning the rights and freedom of choice of women who fall victim to rape and states of war .
8.7859	We really need to be practical .
158.1867	We can not allow this state of affairs to continue , because the rights , priorities and interests of women are often ignored in peace negotiations and also because the few examples of women in decision-making positions in these areas have proved to be very effective .
7.0489	I will mention several of my own priorities .
1810.8012	I am convinced that if women , both Palestinian and Israeli , had a say and a role in the peace process , there is every likelihood that a fair and viable solution to the Palestinian question would have been found and we would not now be facing the present crisis , which is the outcome of 7 whole years of failed negotiation .
273.7963	Mr President , the report by Mrs Theorin includes many bizarre and curious elements , and I have to say we should avoid the notion that armies are some sort of social service and that their guiding motive should be political correctness .
16.3910	Mr President , please tell me who is representing the Council at the moment , or the High Representative for the CFSP .
113.2817	To create antagonism between the sexes , as there is a determination to do in this Chamber this evening , is neither peaceful nor constructive in my view .
107.3617	Mr President , what is clear is that we are witnessing an initial stage in which the gender dimension , the participation of women , is starting to become , if not the rule , then at least an element in various programmes .
114.6919	So I think both sources of funding should be considered , with a view to carrying out a comprehensive study of the issue and to finding out what kind of initiatives people are trying to get off the ground in particular countries .
6.9563	In some cases they are exploited and ill-treated .
7.4990	I shall evaluate some of these arguments .
3.4254	The second argument is that it would create a B team within the labour market .
269.3502	In Austria , and especially in my own region , an EU-assisted project involving a women 's advice centre acting as an agency for domestic helps has been very successfully running for three years .
586.1387	Now that the dark pages of the last ten years have been turned , your presence before this House bears witness to our common desire to see Yugoslavia quickly rediscover its rightful place in the family of Europe .
1015.0460	But now , in the wake of the decisive political turn of 24 September , or the even more decisive shift of 5 October , the major goal in Yugoslavia 's foreign policy is to approach in a comprehensive manner a family of nations comprising the European Union and then join it .
30.1110	Our most important task now is to begin to settle democratically internal relations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
258.8721	A democratic joint state makes it possible for Muslims and Albanians in Montenegro and Serbia to live in a single state , and enables us to join forces in building our equally joint state .
29.8535	Mr President , thank you very much for your address which , as you see , has had a great impact on the people assembled in this Chamber .
211.5517	Mr President , on page 27 of the annex to the Minutes my vote is recorded as having been cast in favour of Amendment No 20 to the Morillon report .
30.2158	My aim throughout the report has been to produce a proposal which is politically mature , eminently reasonable and practical for both the institutions and the citizen .
119.2995	Another important amendment is the proposal to have not just the Council , the Commission and Parliament fall within the scope of the regulation , but also all the external bodies .
355.5575	It is also excellent that the institutions should be obliged , or they should be allowed , rather , to release documents also to those not resident in the European Union , or who are not citizens of the European Union .
3.8713	The Cashman report is , therefore , not just any old report .
28.7490	Unfortunately , the wish to anticipate any eventualities and to produce a regulation that is as complete and comprehensive as possible seems to have prevailed .
5.0367	Mr President , a lot of wise things have been said regarding the background to this report .
19.4801	Mr President , the Cashman report can be summarised in four words : citizens ' power over bureaucracy .
21.0990	This is something that Parliament has supported and will probably also emphasise again today , which is important .
37.9400	It is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission .
72.3438	According to reports , this regulation on public access has rarely been discussed in the college , and has been regarded by it up until now as a predominantly official matter .
2.7314	It is citizens ' rights we are dealing with on this occasion .
70.8719	At the same time , we Members of the Bonino List feel that we must not go too far and introduce extreme regulations allowing indiscriminate access to information or opinions which are of no decision-making import .
6.8448	That provision could open the door wide to arbitrariness .
6.6369	There is a difference between words and deeds .
0.2163	It is a matter of legal security , an efficient administration and effective democracy .
7.0678	That is certainly what we as a Parliament should stick to .
20.7338	In any case , we need a new age of enlightenment and this is a great opportunity for us MEPs to show our true colours .
124.7420	In fact , it is important , as far as security is concerned , that the public can judge , using facts and documents , just how much confidence they have in European defence .
36.9464	I would conclude that the Council committed a serious error in July when it categorically declared all documents about military affairs secret .
29.8488	The fundamental principle is therefore openness , but this must be reconciled with safeguarding the public interest and respect for certain rights which warrant special protection .
11.7065	Forcing institutions to publish these internal notes could , in many cases , simply lead to confusion amongst the citizens .
515.8559	It is premature at this point in the legislative procedure to take a position on whether there should be a direct relationship between classification and access to documents , as proposed in Amendment No 29 , or whether rules to this effect should be included in the present regulation .
89.8840	Mr Cashman was right to say that it is not up to the Commission to tell the political groups how they should vote here in plenary .
344.4255	I would like to remind you of the pivotal role that the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Malta is playing in the ongoing negotiations towards the Republic of Malta ' s membership of the EU .
40.7648	We are not allowing them to set their own capital charges but we would be getting suspiciously close to that if we did not keep a close eye on their internal systems .
3962.9446	-LRB- PT -RRB- Mr President , I wish to inform the House that the amendments that appear under the name of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , which I have tabled in my capacity as rapporteur , are the result of discussions with the Council and the Commission and also have the support of the coordinators of the political groups that are represented in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
0.2164	We are dealing with a very important piece of legislation and with important articles .
15.4492	-LRB- Applause from the PPE-DE Group -RRB-
41.3123	Mr President , unlike Mrs Theorin , I do not suggest moving votes and debates to suit my own personal agenda .
8.6052	I am one of those Members who attends sittings quite faithfully .
19.4814	I voted against whole herd slaughter because I do not believe it is the best way to eradicate BSE .
27.2933	take measures at pan-European level ,
143.1737	Lesson number two : quality farming , which ensures a certain independence in regard to food , can not survive in Europe in the context of a global free market .
107.7573	The Union as a whole must be involved , for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual .
71.8045	The CAP has always promoted intensive production , the gradual ` stepping up ' of production and land concentration , which has basically served the interests of the agro-food industry and the big transnational food companies .
221.0411	This attitude is combined with lack of confidence in the European Union , which appears to the citizens not to be able to guarantee the safety of the foodstuffs on the market .
94.6056	Let me point to the key role the UEN Group , and also the very coherent draft resolution we tabled , played in ensuring that it took place .
34.3927	Blokland report -LRB- A5-0321 / 2000 -RRB-
22.0762	Parliament also succeeded with another point : plants in which radioactive waste is incinerated must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive .
81.3246	I am absolutely convinced that 99 % of the responsibility for social exclusion and poverty lies with the governments of our 15 States .
6.5643	Unfortunately , however , good intentions do not make a policy , even one of condemnation .
5.3181	Too many of our fellow-citizens are left by the wayside .
11.4490	Since Europe can not be economically strong without social justice , we can only welcome this progress .
23.1728	A more effective way of combating exclusion would be , for example , to establish a European minimum guaranteed wage .
269.4805	With a new , radical approach , I strongly believe that we can , not only turn the corner , but reach the finishing line too and , one day , banish poverty and social exclusion from the North-West entirely .
325.9987	The cold winter days and nights of both northern and southern Europe come to mind , where , sadly , many elderly people are forced by their low income to turn off the heating to save money .
1.9954	- -LRB- FR -RRB- Naturally I am in favour of actively promoting renewable energy sources .
17.9536	I therefore thank Mrs Rothe for her good report .
74.3226	This particularly applies to people who are not very well off and whose first concern , therefore , is that their household costs should remain as low as possible .
0.2459	The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
455.3595	There is just one aspect that we are unhappy with , which is not a problem of substance , but concerns item 5 of this resolution : we feel that , by adopting this item , the European Parliament has adopted an excessively paternalistic attitude .
1684.3355	We believe that , not only now but since Parlacen was born , there are people who wish it to have fewer competences and less of a presence , because a parliament always creates discomfort , but I believe that the vocation of Parlacen , and of this and other parliaments , is to be of benefit to the people it represents , even if this may make the established powers feel uncomfortable .
454.9508	This is one of those questions on which we all feel practically the same , not only in this House but also amongst those many Members who , as result of our own origins , view with great sympathy the processes of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries which we consider to be our own .
986.6278	Within our framework of cooperation with the area , we have paid special attention to all those institutions which support regional integration , the general secretariat of the Central American Integration System , the Court of Justice and especially Parlacen , which is one of our priority objectives .
69.8258	That is why we were so disturbed and sad to see the slow political , economic and human ruination of this country , orchestrated by the military junta of General GueÃ ¯ .
9.4382	The West bears a patent and overwhelming responsibility for the current collapse of the Ivoirian system .
5.9285	The leaders have now been given a new chance and let us hope they seize it .
217.4042	The European Union must also make sure that none of its members establishes relations with its former colonies - and let me emphasise this - that are based solely on economic interests or geostrategic location .
38.7937	When Watara ' s supporters took to the streets in order to demand new elections their protest was put down using violent means .
429.0225	The European Union has been asked , and has declared itself prepared , to help ensure that the elections in December , as well as the local elections in January , are conducted in a peaceful , fair , free and transparent manner .
1092.8054	Mr President , by means of various recent declarations , the European Union has condemned the abuses of General GueÃ ¯ ' s regime ; it has also expressed its regret at the outright exclusion of the main opposition candidates from the election of 22 October , which has to a large extent limited the credibility of that very electoral process .
12.5370	-LRB- B5-0861 / 2000 -RRB- by Vinci and others , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group ;
593.0569	Mr President , in an answer to me on Burma in the October session Commissioner Patten said that if things deteriorate in Burma , then holding the EU-ASEAN meeting planned for 11 and 12 December would be reconsidered .
2894.1116	As has been said , the truth is that the situation in Burma is getting worse ; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as Aung San Suu Kyi and that the Democratic League can not operate normally in its work for the re-establishment of democracy , especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom , that lack of union rights there .
682.5014	I know that it is of some small comfort that we continue to bang on the door of this evil and vicious regime and I hope very much that the suggestions that have been made by both Mr Deva and Mrs Kinnock will be recognised by the Commission and respected .
21.9592	Vietnam
41.7561	We work with Vietnam ; it is our partner , and so we can not afford to keep our lips sealed about the situation there .
8.9587	We adopted the resolution and we have had occasion to note that it brought about a few small improvements .
41.3831	Israel is probably one of the most obvious examples in world history of the fact that it is not so simple .
94.4219	Equally , consider how the special UN rapporteur ' s recommendations regarding religious intolerance were ignored , and think of the lack of freedom of expression and the ongoing media censorship .
249.6409	We in the Commission fully share your concerns about this situation and we agree wholeheartedly with the numerous criticisms expressed here today of the way in which the military regime usually makes a mockery of each and every principle contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
419.0078	I fully share the concern about the problems raised by some Members : although it is true that almost 23 000 people have already been freed as a result of general amnesties , we must continue to show concern for those are still in prison for their political or religious beliefs .
18.8880	The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m .
344.9740	The EU has a wonderful opportunity to really take a lead in this change to an ecologically sustainable society where we will not have to deal with floods partly caused by our own inability to face up to the consequences of our own actions .
154.0774	The Commission must make all speed to use its energies and funds to ensure that those affected in the hardest hit areas are helped immediately , through such instruments as the ERDF and the EAGGF Guarantee Section .
763.9807	And given the remarkable scale of the disaster , the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified , despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this House - on 26 October to be precise - and that a Parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well .
3.0967	As you know , we have a basic difficulty : the legal basis for taking action .
1.8763	The next item is the vote on the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
580.3623	Mr President , I have concerned myself very closely with this question and have taken part in many discussions both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
1.5484	I understand that this will meet with the approval of the other groups .
286.4001	We believe that the aim should be to strengthen the public health system and the system of social protection and to safeguard its basic content , in the sense of a universal service , by supplying high-quality medical care and preventative care to every citizen , paying particular attention to those living in remote or island areas , within the framework of a single public-sector system of health and social insurance .
416.2954	But let me specially emphasise the accuracy of the statement that all other health protection should be a matter for Member States rather than the European Union and that publicly funded healthcare systems should remain , as ever , within the exclusive competence of the Member States .
1.8625	The remainder of his proposals serve to dress the wounds that this option will cause .
90.2592	At least , the majority of my group voted against ; and after all we did ensure that the report was not adopted during the last plenary part-session , but postponed until today .
453.4455	So that means that if we manage to reach a decision at first reading , jointly with the Council and the moderation of the Commission , we will be happy to do so , but we will not give up our right to the codecision procedure from the outset .
1129.9941	But let us , after all , assume that the referee has not sold out to the other side and let us accept the idea that the texts by the Commission and the rapporteur respond to a real and growing problem , as the report has it , and that the fact that these matters are being considered here at the same time the Basel committee is considering them is a chance to settle them finally .
3.6791	It is the small and medium-sized businesses that create most new jobs and protect existing ones .
48.6163	It is therefore important not to dissociate ourselves from what is happening in Basel , even though we obviously have our own legislative procedure .
23.7487	A basic point for us in the process is the way in which we seek to maintain the present institutional balance .
125.6442	I apologise to the House for being tempted at the end of the afternoon at the end of this part-session to take some of my longings for home as my inspiration for the debate on this report .
10.8716	The public need to have the utmost confidence that the Ombudsman is completely impartial in his investigations .
19.0901	I would like to thank the rapporteur , Almeida Garrett , for her contribution in this important matter .
1230.8947	In relation to the Ombudsman , a matter we have just been discussing , there were several complaints in the past about the lack of transparency in regard to recruitment , and that is a very crucial point , because we entirely agree with the Ombudsman 's view that recruitment procedures are many young EU citizens ' first contact with the European institutions .
3.1913	If there are inconsistencies it must be open to the candidate to draw attention to them .
91.5155	We must not introduce more rigidity into provisions that may apply to institutions as different as the Commission and the Court of Justice .
89.7206	The Committee says that the Commission has informed the Ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of July 2000 .
125.8220	They are extremely clear , concise , pragmatic amendments which represent genuine reform , that is , the only reform worthy of the name which the European institutions ought to adopt on the recruitment procedure .
32.3190	It is a hallmark of a confident democracy if the processes by which selection is made is done openly and without any recourse to confidentiality or secrecy .
375.4497	For example , candidates are already allowed to take the examination questions away with them , the general evaluation criteria can be made known to those candidates who request them , the list of passes can be published in the Official Journal and the composition of the selection board may be published in the Official Journal -LRB- in the case of general public entrance examinations -RRB- or on the Commission ' s web site -LRB- in the case of internal or restricted examinations -RRB- .
83.8659	Some months ago now , President Prodi declared that this option would be available for all competitions as of July 2000 .
13.4908	For the moment our business is to adopt the Minutes .
11.4068	-LRB- Applause -RRB-
93.7475	I therefore agree that there should be a higher weighting coefficient - 10 % for example - but it must be totally fixed in all cases and all circumstances .
300.5685	I am of the view that , as a European Parliament , we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a European Police College under way .
516.4296	We know that there are still a number of Member States that support the creation of the College only as a permanent network of national institutes , but we feel that the majority will accept this proposal as a temporary stage that will make it possible to create a tangible institution within a maximum of three years .
13.5251	The term ` police academy ' makes me think of a humorous American TV series about the police .
313.6808	Let us make sure that if we have a police college it is , as Mr Posselt 's report stresses , grounded in the need to develop and enhance respect for human and civil rights in our police culture .
34.1659	As long as such matters have not been clarified , I have to say to you in all honesty that I myself can not consent to the basic idea .
21.6202	I note that the rapporteur wants to change `` law enforcement officers '' to `` police '' , which is probably a good idea .
27.6303	Coming from a different part of the political spectrum , it is very interesting to hear him repeat , with the same hysteria , the same concerns .
40.0635	You might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order .
23.5394	I would prefer a small-scale , trained and organised police force , constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function .
0.2116	The Commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided .
1465.1327	It is especially important to stress that the European Police College , which is expected to start its operations on 1 January 2001 , is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the Member States of the European Union ; it also involves the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
73.8569	According to what I have been told , this is the route that Europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course .
4.4647	There are constitutional concerns in some Member States , notably Germany and Austria .
126.7167	A Europe without borders has most certainly contributed to an increase in the number of marriages between couples with different nationalities from both the E.U. and third countries .
7.8583	Unfortunately , others separate on the basis of accumulated hatred .
658.0354	While it is true , however , that it is a great step forward from this point of view , I also share the opinion of Mrs Banotti and other honourable Members that it is deplorable that the scope of this regulation should be limited to the protection of children of marriages that are recognised as such by the law .
10.3645	Could I ask for clarification on your point about Article 17 .
588.5985	With regard to the proposals submitted by the major federations for certain sports , which are in support of a protocol that would exempt them from complying with some of the Treaty ' s basic rules , specifically those relating to free movement and to competition , it must be emphasised that this kind of exemption would , if we accept this definition of it , clearly be out of step with all of the objectives we are seeking to achieve .
34.7248	The EU must not shrug its shoulders and say `` tant pis '' if banning the transfer system does irreparable harm to football .
11.7650	I wish , before the Commission is granted new powers in this area , it would use those it already has .
957.0648	Provided that the details of its implementation respect the relevant rules , such a measure seems to be in line with current Community law which aims at the elimination of distortion of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and at harmonisation of levy systems within the European Union .
661.1343	It may be advantageous at this moment just to say what has actually been proposed by the UK government and also what they are proposing , bearing in mind the crisis in Britain and indeed throughout the whole of the European Union with regard to the road haulage industry .
61.5082	When an important proposal of this kind comes forward we , in this House , should have the chance to think about it and discuss it as early as possible , not necessarily for the last time .
7.3724	Precautionary measures are therefore required in this area .
222.0612	On the first point you made , Mr Miller , this proposal was put to the House by the President and it was the House which agreed to the change to today 's agenda .
12.5413	I agree that Irish trucks have a special case .
47.6942	I should like to express my deepest sympathy to his family and friends and to all those in Spain who believe in the strength of democracy .
11.2899	This has been noted , Mr Dell ' Alba .
737.0177	In order not to let the mandate of the Buenos Aires plan of action , that ran until the so-called COP6 conference , expire without any concrete result or follow-up , parties have decided to suspend COP6 and resume the conference in May 2001 .
15.6290	In addition to further coordination within the European Union , contacts with other parties should be intensified .
4.8187	This was felt by many countries , particularly the green groups , to be a huge loophole .
333.7282	The fact that after Mr Prescott ' s rather noisy departure , the Americans tabled new proposals , which came closer to the EU position , demonstrates that the French Presidency was right to hold firm .
103.6542	If the clean development mechanism starts working then they will receive between USD 5 billion and USD 25 billion in addition , annually .
23.5545	China will then have to stabilise its emissions , and then India will be allowed to double its emissions .
12.0328	The United States produce the largest amount of pollution per capita .
37.3032	The Environment Committee of this Parliament has been at the forefront in addressing the issue of climate change in the past .
27.4015	I should not , however , like to enter into personal squabbles , and I think we should refrain from that sort of completely negative discussion .
16.3814	Kyoto must not remain an empty promise .
39.0044	Secondly , I think that the section of commerce and industry which looks seriously at this problem and which would like to have some ground rules has also lost out .
713.4730	To put it frankly , if we have to make an assessment of what took place , we could say that out of the three parties participating in the Conference , only one tried to reach an agreement and tried to achieve a global policy on climate change , and that was the European Union .
30.4511	Of course we need some clear operational rules to regulate an emissions trading market worth twelve billion dollars .
26.2709	All ministers know that they can not escape this huge task of combating climate change ; this was also clear from the meeting in The Hague .
28.6989	The President of the Republic himself is coming here on 12 December to present a report on the Presidency .
5.5461	The Fifteen are now close to agreement on making enhanced cooperation more flexible .
1064.3921	On the other hand , the idea of a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6 , championed by the European Parliament in its recommendation of 14 November , and placed on the table at the IGC by the French Presidency , was vigorously rejected by several Member States .
359.4839	We will therefore have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the Cologne European Council and the European Union will have at its disposal a very strong benchmark , clearly setting out the rights and values in which it believes .
365.4213	Finally , the Nice European Council will reflect the priority the French Presidency accords to economic and social issues and all the issues where the European Union can really respond to the concerns of Europeans .
123.7343	Moreover , on the basis of the Feira conclusions for the implementation of a Commission Action Plan `` e-Europe 2002 - an information society for all '' , the Council has worked on progress indicators .
788.0148	There are several aspects to this debate , and I will touch briefly on three of them : firstly , the need to close the Intergovernmental Conference by adopting a treaty that has genuine added value ; secondly , our security policy on crisis management ; and finally , the need to mark out the way beyond Nice .
1.6494	Much remains to be done if we are to find a suitable solution .
315.4759	So we do need a reweighting of voting rights with a view to ensuring that a majority of states which are home to a minority of the European population can not ultimately make the rules ; the unequivocal democratic principle must certainly prevail here .
43.2606	I agree totally with the sentiment of President Prodi that this is an historic opportunity and one that should not be lost .
32.9591	My group , at this stage , would prefer a reweighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that other issues are under review .
238.4505	Our group strongly supports constitutionalising the European Union Treaties , and this also means that the reform of the Treaties should be open , with civil society being able to participate in this process .
72.8924	If democracy is to be strengthened , this naturally implies that majority voting must be accompanied by a right of codecision for the European Parliament .
39.0533	Let us not start again tomorrow with a new multilateral agreement on investment or new talks on agriculture post Seattle .
3.6399	Home affairs and legal policy are to be subject to majority voting as from 2004 .
63.9762	Mr President , the very title of this item on our agenda indicates the importance of Article 133 in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting .
12.6249	It is extremely sad that a situation has developed where large and small countries have come to take opposite sides .
150.5642	If we want to actually overcome the deadlock on qualified majority in order to enable the European Union to accommodate new members , then everyone has to make some small concession .
136.1560	Parliament has also proved itself a serious partner within the drafting of the Charter , and it would be especially refreshing should British Prime Minister Blair publicly recognise that fact .
425.3128	A decision in Nice to the effect that , for example , the applicant States must have the opportunity to participate in the next elections to the European Parliament could help put the necessary pressure on the EU itself , so that enlargement can become a reality .
345.6744	I would gladly give up these 40 extensions if we could achieve majority voting in five areas where substantive progress can be made , such as trade , social policy , justice and home affairs , structural policy and taxation , to name the most important .
7383.6636	It is now the eve of its conclusion and we are aware of the progress which has been made , the partial results which have been achieved , but frankly , over almost ten months of a major Intergovernmental Conference , there has been no rapprochement of the positions , Mr VÃ © drine , and no definition of agreements , not to mention the fact that some of the topics indicated by Parliament in its resolution of 13 April , ranging from the regulation of the economy to the institutional implications of the common defence policy , have not even been debated .
30.5022	The governments have lost sight of the urgent need for reforms because they are concentrating too much on their own position of power in the new set-up .
274.8574	Mr President I would like to remind the Council and Commission , and indeed the House , of a resolution that we carried on 26 October in relation to better law-making .
19.2520	I believe that all the speakers are very concerned about the results of the Nice European Council .
231.2416	Finally , not only has the Charter of Fundamental Rights not yet been incorporated into the text of the Treaty ; it has barely even been agreed to mention it in Article 6 .
989.0557	While not in any way detracting from the aspirations , and indeed the entitlement , of some of those countries to join the Community by 2002 , it would not , I believe , be in their best interests , or indeed the interests of Member States , to achieve this deadline without first ensuring an orderly transition with minimum disruption to the economies of existing Member States .
9.1812	Everyone will have to sacrifice some of their cherished exceptions if we are to reach a result in Nice .
85.3023	We know that a definitive solution must be in place for the parliament to be elected in 2009 , which will , after all , last until 2014 .
298.4779	I take the view that Nice must at least accept the compromise called for by the European Parliament , i.e. for the Charter to be combined with Article 6 , paragraph 2 .
143.4276	Our public in the EU and the public in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of Nice leftovers , of a second IGC in 2004 .
9.8302	Should we falter , this will provoke Parliament ' s condemnation .
802.1767	Although we now see the French Presidency , Mr President of the Council , playing a decisive part here , it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today , just a few days before the IGC ministerial meeting .
52.7026	Besides , the overall result of the coming IGC ministerial meeting , another small but unfortunately far from delicate detail is causing me some concern .
47.5113	Despite that , although this exercise is also very useful because it raises many relevant questions and suggestions , I have to say that I found the overall tone excessively negative .
4.0811	We are doing our best , if I may say so .
44.7618	They accept it in principle , they accept it for the long term , but they have legitimate democratic interests to defend , and in their view the right conditions are not yet in place .
463.2322	This is why it is so important that the Community method is consolidated at Nice , together with the value of the European institutions - the Council , Parliament and the Commission - and their ways of working together .
52.9428	This was an abuse of this Parliament 's proceedings , a gross discourtesy to a distinguished guest and an event that could have had very serious consequences .
316.0123	I shall give the President the name of the Member in question and ask her to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing such disruptive and aggressive individuals from entering the House . The shocking thing is that this incident took place with the aid of a Member of this House .
2055.7791	Virtually the same day , a leader from the Cypriot Parliament , who has , moreover , already visited the European Parliament , Mr Christou , was refused a Turkish visa even though he was travelling , if you can believe it , to a tripartite meeting in Istanbul between Turks , Greeks and Cypriots , in a totally peaceable context .
3.2033	This is evidence of the way verbal violence leads to physical violence .
292.8571	In 1966 , Ernest Lluch , his brother and myself , with more than 60 other members of the teaching staff were expelled by the Francoist regime from the University of Barcelona .
9.0243	Mr Gorostiaga , you are a disgrace to this Parliament .
1719.9154	-LRB- A5-0339 / 2000 -RRB- by Mrs LalumiÃ ¨ re , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the establishment of a common European security and defence policy after Cologne and Helsinki -LRB- 2000/2005 -LRB- INI -RRB- -RRB- ;
31.0238	Mobilisation orders are also a national responsibility , because each country takes a sovereign decision as to whether or not it will participate in a joint operation .
37.8886	First , a brief comment on a crucial issue : the relationship between the new European policy and NATO .
19.7213	Similarly the status of the High Representative must be clarified in relation to the existing triangle and the Commissioner responsible for external relations .
11.8560	The next issue is ongoing arrangements with third countries and NATO .
55.6032	Three common strategies have been adopted since May 1999 , on Russia , on Ukraine and on the Mediterranean region .
699.0700	An EU-Ukraine Summit also took place , on 15 September , and the fruitful political dialogue that resulted is now being extended to issues of conventional arms exports , security and disarmament , a subject highlighted by the OSCE as being a problem where Ukraine is concerned .
783.6489	I would not want to conclude this summary without mentioning the Union ' s action on what are today known as the great global or cross-sectoral dossiers , particularly in the field of human rights , where work is still necessary to improve the coherence of European policy in international bodies and to involve civil society more closely .
101.1340	I am delighted to continue in this vein by talking to you today about the results of our conference on military commitments of 20 November .
13.4027	These contributions therefore enable us , in terms of quantity , to fully meet the overall target set by the Council .
217.1949	By 2003 , when the bodies that have been established are in a position to fulfil their duties , the European Union will gradually become capable of accomplishing some of the Petersberg tasks .
150.8117	We all know that the genesis of the European Union , the main objective of the founding fathers was to prevent Europe tearing itself apart in yet another civil war .
49.0790	There is need for further reinforcement of coherence and effectiveness in the external activities of the European Union cutting across the pillars .
33.5502	Again , I refer to the sometimes not entirely balanced and objective media in my own country , who seem to have some difficulty in comprehending that distinction .
393.2683	The Talokan offensive cut off the only route of supply to the Panchir Valley and the Shomali Plains , where Commander Massood 's forces are concentrated , as also a large proportion of the uprooted people and refugees .
8.2081	The rapid reaction force is intended to implement the Petersberg tasks .
47.0139	It therefore seems a little unnecessary to regulate in great detail how , for example , European forces in space are to be organised .
184.7613	The same ideas about the greatest possible transparency were expressed in Mr Cashman ' s report which we adopted with a broad majority two weeks ago in Strasbourg .
130.9086	I would like to hear what Mr Richard has to say to this and ask him what he thinks Parliament ' s role ought to be if there is no such secret protocol .
8.8857	That has to stop .
590.9718	Nevertheless , the ` Republic of Fear ' , as Saddam ' s reign of terror was appropriately dubbed many years ago , is still greatly underestimated by many western politicians , also within the European Parliament .
1403.8685	I would like to highlight very clearly the progress made by the French Presidency in the field of common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence policy , and I wish to say this particularly because , in the previous debate on the European Council in Nice , certain reservations were expressed on the progress made in general during this presidency .
264.4612	I realise , Minister , that you are sceptical and that you have just said ` No ' again , as you did in Paris on a previous occasion , but this Parliament still believes in these principles , irrespective of party allegiance , and we shall go on campaigning for their acceptance .
8.7035	Concentration on purely reactive crisis management has thrown the common foreign and security policy totally out of synch .
351.8526	This means that curbing arms exports to unstable regions must be the first aim for the Council to pursue , that trade policies must be fair , that assistance must be given to encourage the sustainable development of countries in volatile regions and , above all , that the democratic forces in civil society must be supported .
149.3225	We also warmly applaud the efforts undertaken by Mr Patten - whom we hold in very high esteem , as we do Mr Solana - because something is being done at last .
109.2853	I have to say that there is much in the Brok report that we can support , in particular the importance attached to enlargement of the European Union .
199.5969	Thirdly , while I welcome the Rapid Reaction Force , we have to be clear from Europe 's perspective , as we only get one chance to get this right .
26.9346	Mr President , today we are debating two politically important reports , both of which basically concern the CFSP .
1.9386	We will never be philosophically neutral nor should that ever be confused with military neutrality .
551.0633	However , I wonder whether it would not have been possible to be harder and harsher in our criticism and even threaten to impose sanctions on the country which gives the regime the greatest support , support without which the Taliban regime would crumble , namely Pakistan .
8321.5326	Mr President , Paragraph 31 of Mr Brok ' s report on the common foreign and security policy highlights the following message : ' -LSB- The European Parliament -RSB- stresses the need , for the democratic legitimacy of Russia , given its political union with Belarus , that Russia 's president and government unequivocally reiterate the strong need for democratic reforms in Belarus , particularly in the light of the report delivered in Minsk on 16 October 2000 by the parliamentary troika from the European Union , the Council of Europe and the OSCE . '
2.7195	On the question of the concept : this concept was adopted in 1992 .
2473.5475	There will still be other forms of rapprochement to invent with the national parliaments , but at any rate one thing that is within our reach and that represents a turning point I believe we can all welcome , is the fact that the fifteen nations which make up this Union , which have already built a political reality that has a positive effect on the international balance of power , these fifteen nations have chosen to acquire the means to act jointly in cases where violence challenges our values .
64.8310	Following the reports by the independent experts , the Commission , at the initiative of Mr Kinnock , presented a White Paper proposing reforms to the way it functions .
111.8482	The leitmotif is the systematic reminder that , parallel to any legislative procedure , all budgetary decisions must be taken in the framework of the related annual procedures and the Interinstitutional Agreement .
21.6121	Our committee was very pleased to see the conclusions of the Bourlanges report on externalisation taken up in the Letter of Amendment .
98.2540	It will be followed by many other reports and , for my part , after these weeks of working together , I hope we adhere to this method in future too .
39.4291	This is the basis of the new philosophy for management of the Commission : each administrative unit will be expected to take responsibility for the regularity and legality of all its actions .
51.1796	Mr President , it is a special pleasure for me finally , and I emphasis the word finally , to be here tonight presenting this report .
2.6692	That is the core of what we are trying to do here .
118.6535	Is the Commission able today to carry out the tasks and , in addition , the political role which fall to it under the Treaties ?
18.3313	We will continue it in spring on the basis of the Nice conclusions and the new Commission proposals .
58.2553	Nevertheless , we will give the Commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal .
16.4675	The reform process is on track and being implemented as the Commission ' s progress reports have shown .
13.3612	The same practice needs to be followed in the payment of EU bills as in the outside world .
352.3347	Indeed , we believe that the establishment of new posts has been very tentative ; given the current tasks of the Commission and the forthcoming eastward enlargement , there will certainly be a need to increase the rate of staff recruitment in future .
4.0035	The new rules must therefore be tested as to their feasibility .
206.0222	The entire structure of the Commission , which is a fundamental institutional body of the Union 's current system , implements European Union policy as willed by Parliament and the Council .
21.7039	We are opposing the rest of the amendments as they either add nothing to the report or basically take us off into flights of fantasy .
26.3398	Consequently , our Group supports the Commission ' s proposals - the White Paper - promoted by Commissioner Kinnock .
1.6325	Delays in payment are mounting up and the bureaucratic obstacles are well known .
64.9298	We have all seen how the culture of fear has rather paralysed - totally paralysed I might say - the decision-making processes within the Commission , and by that I also mean the departments and the officials .
50.9352	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am going to be very brief , but first I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs .
386.7643	It is also appropriate for me to provide an up-to-date picture of the latest progress with the implementation of our strategy for applying modernising changes and for preparing the further improvements , which we outlined in our strategy eight months ago .
27.8578	With more time , naturally , I would be very happy to address the matters raised , and I am sure that there will be other opportunities .
51.9022	Some building blocks are being chiselled out , while others still have to be approved in formal decisions of Parliament and the Council prior to implementation .
96.5701	It must become a matter of course for the Commission to pay invoices within the prescribed time limit , and this is the target the Commission has set itself .
24.4163	The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m .
65.0986	We will see this next year when we are presented with the assessment we are asking for of the results of the reform .
43.6017	Thirty years ago , it provided 7 % of international aid ; today the figure is 17 % .
10.7132	We want clearer objectives .
4.4379	The Commission must also ensure that this happens at international level .
70.6515	This report told us how , in fact , poverty and under-development continue to gain ground and that a huge number of people are still unable to exercise their inalienable right to live in dignity .
29.6468	The process of implementing the Commission ' s decision of May on reform of external relations is going well .
82.0668	It is also necessary to make sure that programmes can in future be easily managed by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners .
7280.7414	Report -LRB- A5-0342 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 142 - C5-0175 / 2000-2000/0066 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB-
140.6809	The fact is that , on the basis of proposals we made last February , the European Commission put forward its own proposals with the greatest alacrity .
1424.4098	All lie at the very heart of the regulations of shipping as a whole and I want to remind you that , in addition to the three proposals which are to be discussed here today , the ` Erika II ' package , as Mr Gayssot has already mentioned , will be put on the table next week .
8.4199	Since then , sadly , there have been many other disasters at sea , we know only too well .
35.0582	Thirdly , we support , and there is a great amount of support , that a dangerous ship should not simply be detained and then allowed to return to sea .
377.6449	I may add that the Commission 's initiative in presenting this position was an important initiative because it acted like a sword of Damocles , effectively pressuring the Ã  Ã  Ã  into getting a move on .
110.6142	On the other hand , it requires that inspections only be carried out by specialist , exclusive inspectors , that they may not have a relationship with or be dependent on the shipowner in any way , and that the shipowner may not control the vessel classification society .
295.1521	Furthermore , although the direct dumping of industrial materials , including military dumps of redundant munitions , is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States , the sights of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases a threat to human safety .
3.1858	The cooperation includes exchange of information and mapping of munitions dump sites .
2075.8414	Vigorous action must be taken on the question of flags of convenience , including that of the Kerguelen Islands in the case of France , and against ships which fly the flag of states with above average detentions and delays during the 36 months preceding the adoption of these directives , which are blacklisted in the annual report of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding .
8.6460	The choice is yours .
9.6141	My first request to you is that the Council sign , seal and deliver this very quickly .
1.9235	If a flag state defaults , then the port state must be given increased responsibility .
183.9322	Eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub-standard in terms of safety , and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances .
8.2974	Many players have stressed that the lack of maritime safety is largely due to deregulation and lenient practices .
1897.3109	How , with the European Union under a French Presidency , will we be able to explain to the people of France that the European Parliament has abolished the necessary incentive and financial deterrence measures proposed in order to expedite the phasing in of double-hull oil tankers ?
31.0843	Speaking of the responsibilities of the port state , we must take care not to underplay the importance of the tasks to be fulfilled by the port authorities .
1366.1890	As we understand that it is the minimum text that the Council will accept , we are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading , but we will not vote against it because we recognise the excellent work done by the rapporteur , Mr Ortuondo , which resulted in some agreed amendments which show us the path to take for the next reading .
72.1392	All eyes were on the Erika in the first instance , but a tanker was sinking in other waters off Turkey at the same time .
4.6357	I have a few brief comments to make regarding single-hull ships .
6.5763	We have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected .
3.0920	We must have a full picture of all parties ' responsibilities and hence of their liability .
5.4526	That also goes for the matter of double-hull design requirements .
7.3847	Then perhaps we could have avoided a catastrophe .
146.7578	I think we can strike the required balance on the basis of the Commission and IMO proposals and the reports under discussion , on which the rapporteurs really do deserve to be congratulated .
29.0122	This is demonstrated by the fact that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have certainly had some success .
26.5539	Classification society performance must be assessed by common criteria : number of accidents , incidents or detentions of inspected and certified ships that cause pollution .
169.9100	When the Ievoli Sun sank , it was relatively young , it had a double hull , a crew from the European Community and it was flying the Italian flag .
94.7039	But the most important thing is the unshakeable will which must motivate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to establish maritime safety .
1.7660	Most of the amendments are focused on the proposed refusal of access to Community waters .
9.7448	Many are either outside the scope of the port state control or are already covered by this or another directive .
182.5971	For similar reasons , the Commission can not accept the new Amendment No 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation .
23.1722	I share Parliament ' s concern that there should be no undue influence from a shipowner over a classification society .
114.3943	Secondly , in our proposal on ` Erika II ' concerning surveillance of navigation , Member States will be required to intervene even on the high seas in such cases .
6.9569	Mr Poos , would you like to add something to the debate ?
26.9125	-LRB- Parliament approved the Commission proposal -RRB-
45.0268	We are withdrawing the resolution since its content has been reproduced almost in full and to the letter in the joint resolution signed by the Chairmen of the main political groups .
133.9468	The first part is an oral amendment , but the second part is a motion for a split vote , which I can not accept , because it has not been tabled in time .
3545.6955	Report -LRB- A5-0328 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Lamassoure , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the White Paper on reforming the Commission -LRB- aspects concerning the Committee on Constitutional Affairs -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 200 - C5-0448 / 2000 - 2000/2218 -LRB- COS -RRB- -RSB-
24.8548	Watts report -LRB- A5-0343 / 2000 -RRB-
39.5053	Merchant ships need to be inspected by government departments with suitably trained staff and proper technological facilities , with the active involvement of the shipping trade union movement .
142.8495	. -LRB- FR -RRB- I voted in favour of the Watts report , which aims to enhance the quality and frequency of inspections in the ports of the Member States of the European Union .
222.7782	If we had thought of it before , if Mr Hatzidakis had been here before , in previous years , he would surely have proposed the double-hull design and we would have avoided so many disasters .
28.1136	The risk of ships crashing into each other is so great there that without extra supervision and inspections , shipping accidents are becoming increasingly likely .
15.0462	We must stick with the Commission proposal .
255.8037	In the case of the Erika , the local fishing and aquaculture industries suffered a bitter blow and it is important not just to look at the harmful effects that are apparent in the immediate aftermath , but also to look ahead at the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution .
327.3680	The Commission and the Council must now follow up the request for environmental impact assessments -LRB- EIAs -RRB- and put it to the Russian authorities that all future oil trade with Russia will be conditional upon an EIA .
4.4796	What is more , the training of the inspectors of these societies differs from country to country .
10.6528	But the best result of all would be if harmonised inspections were to become the direct responsibility of the government .
40.9038	We reject the general extension of qualified majority voting accompanied by the simultaneous extension of codecision and the abolition of the Luxembourg compromise .
16.8661	Within foreign and security policy we take a positive view of the fact that crisis management has been given a prominent position .
518.6012	As we have also made known through the individual votes , we have , throughout the Intergovernmental Conference , been opposed to the much expanded agenda which , by means of repeated motions for resolutions , the majority in the European Parliament has been trying to draw up .
14.5822	The importance of the Social Agenda must also be highlighted so that it can be implemented speedily .
160.0942	As far as the general extension of qualified majority voting is concerned , I do not believe that this is a helpful proposal as it would pre-empt the right of Member States to take a decision at the appropriate time on whether a policy should be communitised .
503.6937	All the advocates of a liberal Europe are enlarging is the scale of misery of peoples already crushed by poverty and not only that but , on this occasion , they are imposing a political agenda which involves placing on an official footing a core of rich countries which will control an expanded European market .
4.9705	. -LRB- PT -RRB- Parliament has just voted for a resolution on the Nice Summit in which :
0.2458	Our debates within this Chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges .
8.1482	I am against the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a council of defence ministers .
83.8582	We feel that the conversion of the Commission ' s delegations into Community delegations risks leading to conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations of the Member States .
343.6087	Hence , it is clear that the way to strengthen the weight of European diplomatic action is to seek the harmonisation - where desirable , opportune and effective - of decisions which remain fundamentally the prerogative of the national actor , not through structural constraints which are totally ineffectual .
1171.3867	- -LRB- DA -RRB- The Liberals ' five Members of the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs LalumiÃ ¨ re ' s report on the common security and defence policy , because we are in favour of strengthening the EU countries ' power to act and , therefore , NATO too .
155.1881	We protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this Chamber , with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups , from the extreme right to the Greens and the Socialists .
79.8865	In Paragraph 49 , Member States who do not wish to or can not participate in a task are nonetheless obliged to make a contribution to the financing of the task .
184.5114	The rapporteur now cites a number of reasons for taking action outside one ' s own territory , one being justifiable outrage at ethnic conflicts outside the Union .
0.1994	Furthermore , there are many paragraphs to which we have specific objections , e.g. :
208.4170	A break of that kind with NATO , only to see a new partitioning of Europe , is far from the enigmatic words spoken following the fall of the Berlin Wall .
19.9048	Let me pre-empt any misinterpretation of my vote as an expression of opposition to women 's participation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
187.0297	. -LRB- FR -RRB- The only positive aspects of this report are that it calls for a ` European definition of domestic work ' and a ` clear limitation of the maximum number of hours to be worked ' .
30.7578	That , of course , almost sounds like a perfect world when I read all the proposals for possible exceptional arrangements that are listed in this report .
62.9961	Income taxes , social security contributions and VAT drive up the hourly rate to levels that almost no household with a normal income is prepared to pay .
48.5643	- -LRB- NL -RRB- Female labour has a long history of poor pay , poor working conditions , a poor legal position and sexual intimidation .
109.3372	This resignation , the outcome of a long process of deterioration , must not however make us forget that the ` Delors Commission ' bore heavier responsibilities than its successor .
8577.6648	But most of all I voted in favour because what I would like - and I want to say this in this Parliament - is that when the accounts are checked , that is , how the money has been spent by the Commission , attention should be paid not only to checking the figures - 4 plus 4 is 8 , 8 plus 8 is 16 , 16 plus 16 is 32 , 32 plus 32 is 64 - but also to checking whether these expenses have really been useful to Europe , whether they have really achieved the aims that they were meant to achieve .
20.7389	By the same token , lack of transparency and nepotism must be eradicated from recruitment , especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts .
89.8761	. British Conservative Members will vote against the report because of the well-rehearsed opposition to the extension of QMV and proposed incorporation of the blanket of fundamental rights into the Treaty .
11.4943	Adjournment of the session
11.4548	That is what I was told , but I shall seek more up-to-date information and I shall pass on your message .
7.2946	That is our group 's position .
10.4414	Madam President , Nice has been a particularly important summit .
0.4253	With regard to the assessments in question , I will give just one example .
64.9299	We believe that this report needs further consideration , which is why we would ask to be able to discuss it and vote on it in January .
75.5348	It is very important that he is present for this report because he is very interested in it and we are very much in the hands of the Commission for its success .
8.6318	We have a rule in this Parliament that smoking is prohibited in certain places - that includes the Chamber .
8.0047	Adjustments had to be made to the draft directive and some have been proposed this time round as well .
4.8897	If not , I have also spoken on her behalf .
9.2358	If this proves not to be the case , at least the responsibilities will be clear and easily identifiable .
125.1967	But ladies and gentlemen , if you truly acknowledged the health problems linked to tobacco , you would demand a ban on this drug , just as you continue to maintain the bans on other substances despite the fact that , quantitatively , they are far less lethal .
6.7681	Amendment No 2 concerning carbon monoxide is , therefore , particularly positive .
20.4495	History teaches us that it is dangerous to regard the goal - however noble and virtuous - as superior to the agreed rules .
1.5561	Mr President , I rise in defence of the workers in the industry .
2.9845	Although I was not present , my vote , of course , supported the Committee .
338.4910	Therefore , I am not concerned so much at the moment with health issues , which are , of course , important and considerable , as with the constraints that would result from our accepting such a restrictive interpretation of the legislative powers which this European Parliament would have .
111.3799	Mr President , if this proposal actually becomes law at second reading , this will lead to companies ' freedom being curtailed somewhat , and to a slight improvement in the protection of public health .
107.0514	The results of the research on that matter are so clear that it would be wrong for us , as European Union legislators , not to follow such advice .
82.6674	Following the European Court of Justice ruling the Committee then adopted the opinion again , admittedly this time by a large majority .
0.2134	This is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way .
5.5401	The power of big tobacco companies is all too evident .
222.6470	To the shame of this European Union , we require our taxpayers to subsidise the growing of the wretched stuff to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year .
9.8043	The testing procedure is inefficient .
412.9126	This directive was introduced to take account of the European Parliament 's Valverde LÃ ³ pez report of 1997 which mentioned many of the elements of the present text and called for a proposal from the Commission .
1.7270	Therefore , the need to regulate in the interests of consumers is clear .
162.6803	In this respect , let me point out that , from the point of view of international and Community rules , there is no exception for registered trade marks in measures taken for public-health protection , particularly here , where the effects on smokers ' behaviour are so dramatic .
11.8540	This is linked to the question of access to products , in particular where machines are situated in unsupervised areas .
21.7908	Summer time
269.8706	There are other issues we would still like to look at , issues like energy consumption and health and safety , as they relate to summer time ; but the strongest argument is undoubtedly that we want to allow new Member States the opportunity to come into line with the arrangements .
88.5616	Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again I see that a far-reaching debate is raging about the pros and cons of summer time .
99.5653	The proposal that has now been made is , in the opinion of our group , a good one , and our group supports it , and no more amendments to it are needed .
200.4397	It also causes problems for agriculture when during autumn threshing the morning dew ought to have disappeared according to the time by the clock , but , wonder of wonders , nature has not been following the directive .
187.4153	As regards the amendments tabled , the Commission can agree to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 since they aim at making the system more transparent and emphasise the precautionary principle .
23.6279	The compromises which we have agreed greatly improve the common position from the European Parliament 's point of view .
10.3916	Children are given medicines which have only been tested on adults , which means that children are badly treated .
16.1378	It may contribute to improving clinical research in Europe and hence the welfare of millions of sick people .
1335.2564	This compromise , which of course can be further improved upon by each Member State , constitutes a minimum standard , to ensure that we do not have a kind of ethical dumping in the European Union and to avoid a situation where it is possible to carry out research on those unable to give informed consent in one Member State and not in others .
296.3398	Finally , and here I am dissatisfied with the Council 's compromise proposals , I think that the main investigator during clinical trails should be a doctor , because only a doctor has the knowledge and experience needed in order to evaluate the benefits and deal with any side effects or risks which arise during the clinical trial .
11194.2639	The next item is the report -LRB- A5-0377 / 2000 -RRB- by Mr Trakatellis , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , concerning the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council extending certain programmes of Community action in the field of public health adopted by Decisions 645/96/EC , 646/96/EC , 647/96/EC , 102/97/EC , 1400/97/EC and 1296/1999/EC and amending those Decisions -LSB- COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 0448 - C5-0400 / 2000 - 2000/0192 -LRB- COD -RRB- -RSB- .
16.8319	I would even go so far as to say that we may well have inaugurated a new modus operandi for codecision issues .
3493.4313	It is precisely on this issue that we believe there is a notable lack of direction in the European Union , in the Council and the Commission , which , with the budgetary cuts - not wanting to reach the ceiling of 1.27 % which the regulations in force currently allow - is harming actions such as these at a time when coordination between the different Member States is becoming increasingly important .
24.1504	This is an area that can be looked at in the context of the new Community health programme which is due to come on stream .
50.9749	The text being agreed today on the extension of six public health programmes reflects what has been informally agreed between the institutions .
613.2071	All of these factors , acting separately , but multiplying their effects when acting together , have meant that every day millions of people quite simply cross the borders of their State of residence into another State of the European Union , whether to live , to work or just to travel .
46.2769	The European Union can not accept the idea that people might receive different treatment depending on the State in which they have been a victim of crime or on their nationality .
52.1537	That is why we should perhaps consider once again whether it is right for us to vote in favour of this initiative .
23.1649	Indeed , we can not talk seriously about a Citizens ' Europe unless we take account of victims ' rights .
84.6817	The Liberal Group feels that a very good report has emerged from the debate in committee and we will be supporting the committee amendments when we vote .
8.8046	Compensation for the victim must take precedence over the payment of the fine and legal costs to the State .
227.7892	I welcome the proposal from Portugal for strengthening the standing of victims of crime in criminal procedure also , even though I have every respect for the views relating to legal aspects expressed by Mr Lehne earlier .
2.1934	Who will then go out and vote if their problems are completely disregarded ?
72.8935	Several amendments refer to the official languages of the European Union , foreseeing the right of victims to communicate in one of these languages .
795.6084	As I have just said , in order to go further within the framework of following up its communication of 14 July 1999 , the Commission works on the adoption of concrete measures to support victims , in particular through the support envisaged for the European forum for victim services .
7.7104	We will take note of it .
628.9681	I think that the institutions , in this case the Commission , should work more responsibly to ensure that proposals reach this House in due time so that a rapporteur can be appointed , the Commission proposal can be examined , amendments can be tabled , they can be debated in committee and they can then come to the plenary , which they have asked us to do in a single plenary sitting , which is impossible .
4.9884	We have not set budgetary objectives in advance and then tried to tailor our policy to them .
3.8695	What worried us most right through the budget procedure was how to fund our foreign policy .
1025.8528	I hope that the person who succeeds me as Parliament 's general rapporteur and the Belgian Presidency of the Council , which will be taking over in the second half of next year , enjoy their discussions .
463.6971	Let me be quite clear here : we have a number of vacant positions here in Parliament , which save us several tens of millions of euros from one year to the next .
116.6852	Perhaps another reason why we should discuss this on our knees is the attitude of some Members of this House , as all they seem to want to do is blindly obey the instructions of the Council .
4332.0129	The first point of agreement between the Council and Parliament concerns external action , that is , heading 4 of the budget , on which our institutions shared a common goal , which was to release substantial funding for the Balkans region in 2001 , given recent developments in Serbia ' s political situation , and to do so without passing the costs of this on to the other geographical priorities of the Union ' s external action .
227.4402	Lastly , agreement was reached on 23 November on an increase in payment appropriations for the 2001 budget , which is an increase of 3.5 % over the 2000 budget .
381.9706	By the same token , within this Interinstitutional Agreement , the Council has left substantial margins within the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , largely for heading 3 - internal policy - and for heading 4 - external action .
13.3166	You must now give this outcome your approval .
73.2032	The Court of Auditors recently confirmed in a special report that this objective is being achieved and that the money from the Cohesion Fund is being put to good use .
490.3102	With regard to the specific cases that we have experienced for the last two years , in other words , Kosovo and Serbia , mobilising the flexibility instrument has enabled us to fund exceptional expenditure through an exceptional effort .
950.0657	If you consider that American companies receive the equivalent of three times as much aid and a capricious country such as Turkey spends in excess of 10 % of government money on agriculture and horticulture , then it is Europe that wants something for nothing .
11.2928	Output instead of input .
7.6215	Commissioner , fish is an essential element for a healthy , balanced diet that is rich in proteins .
173.8569	We believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the European Union institutions operate .
134.2315	It is important for the people in the Balkans to understand , following the long period of hostilities during which our side presented a united front , that they can also rely on us when it comes to reconstruction .
156.1505	You are undermining the Interinstitutional Agreement and let me assure you that we shall consider whether or not we intend to have a part in this next year .
21.6995	Constant use of the flexibility reserve is undermining the transparency of the budget and in time this too will lead to a loss of credibility .
56.3870	Today I join you , the representatives of the European peoples , to tell you the results of the Intergovernmental Conference on institutional reform .
52.8764	I know that Parliament considered the number of areas in which qualified majority voting will apply to be one of the priorities of these negotiations .
44.7507	I would also highlight the fact that this IGC resulted in an extension of the powers and competences of the European Parliament .
32.8814	In the last six months , Europe has also made progress in the field of growth and employment .
1914.1984	Two months ago , our Education Ministers adopted an action plan for mobility - a forty-two point action plan - and we agreed on a substantial allocation of EUR 400 million for the Media-Plus programme , which is so important for European cinema and audiovisual services and which - as you will be aware - the whole profession was hoping for .
524.4489	The Swedish Presidency , one of whose priorities , I would remind you , is the environment , now has the task of concluding the second batch of proposals , which includes in particular , the creation of a European maritime safety agency .
40.5625	The Union intends to use this military wing in complete harmony with NATO facilities and , if necessary , with their support .
14.6294	France has been particularly aware of this .
124.4011	Moreover , in your own address at the beginning of the Summit , you said that Parliament would judge the success of Nice in terms of quality as well as quantity .
46.1633	To respond to our citizens ' demands , we had advocated a double majority as the only solution which is objective , comprehensible and widely supported by smaller and larger countries alike .
84.6274	Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , finally the Summit concluded with a result .
619.9392	At the same time , the declaration on enlargement - which is a positive one - says that the applicant countries will be able to join the Union at the end of 2002 , and the Heads of Government of the countries that are in negotiations have welcomed Nice .
1024.8358	Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to give you a little history lesson , concerning a famous French doctor , whose name was CouÃ © and who invented a method - the CouÃ © method - based on the principle of autosuggestion and self-hypnosis .
664.2652	Besides , what a cruel illustration of the crisis which is not only institutional , but which , at a deeper level , is an identity crisis for European integration in the face of the titanic issues confronting the European Union !
273.9413	The technique is now tried and tested : always put off for another time the burden of proof ; take decisions that are void of content or which will not be implemented for a long time and finally present the whole business as a magnificent success .
1.7005	It upsets almost everyone , beginning with those known as the smaller countries .
23.8227	Taking into account these interests and differences within the Council would have avoided the debates on the number of Commissioners to which each State is clinging .
24.1050	Thank you , Mr Hager .
50.6357	And he adds that we have decided on a handful of targets which the Member States are free to apply if they want to . So that should not worry you ...
18.0913	Before the vote on Amendment No 22 :
131.6999	So use in paediatric medicine sometimes falls under the heading of empirical individual prescriptions , and we need to promote the development at pharmaceutical laboratories of specific products prepared for children and their pathologies so that the doses and forms of the medicines are suited to their bodies .
9.5582	Summer time has , in practice , become normal time .
568.2595	But when I got back to Italy , Mr Fatuzzo , '' continued Carlo Fatuzzo the tourist , `` in order to obtain another identity card and another driving licence , I had to report the incident again , this time to the Italian police .
96.4507	Madam President , I wholeheartedly support this report on better protection for victims of crime which demonstrates yet again in the EU 's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens .
7.3294	I am told he is due to be deported to Russia .
303.1642	Heartbreaking results for Parliament : the refusal to see majority decisions seriously extended ; the exclusion of Parliament from codecision and - I say this in passing - the shocking fact that the composition was fixed without Parliament even being consulted on that composition .
326.8828	For the decisions on Council voting and seats in Parliament a more suitable venue would have been the casino at Cannes rather than the Acropolis at Nice , with Mr Chirac playing the role of chief croupier .
55.2422	For the Swedish negotiators , it would appear to have been more important to please the large Member States than to fight for our own influence .
194.0468	The Treaty of Nice contains a series of quite decisive steps towards an EU of Ã © lites , together with corresponding steps away from a Europe of democracies and of the people .
56.9824	Our method must be a method which allows us to set up an Intergovernmental Conference through a convention at which parliamentarians , not chancelleries have their say if we are to take this continent forward .
14.7288	Mr Prodi , Commissioner Barnier , this is our task .
318.0298	As for the European Parliament , only the Commission defended its legitimacy and I therefore thank President Prodi and Commissioner Barnier for this , but they were alone in their endeavours and this was reflected in the final compromise .
316.3599	Before the Nice Summit the French Presidency was saying ` better no agreement than a bad agreement ' , and this morning , unless I misunderstood , we were in essence told ` better a bad agreement than no agreement at all ' .
43.4944	But the historic failing of Nice is that your resolutions are not based on any identifiable vision for a Union of 27 Member States .
301.1014	However , the national governments ' claim to be the constitutional legislator of Europe has finally been laid to rest , as has the hope that the heads of state and government think of themselves as the trustees of the idea of European unification .
0.4566	Old deficits have not been made good and now new ones have come along .
70.4222	Mr President , first I would like to join in with the praises you have heaped upon Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .
11.1475	I would just like to take up some of the criticisms , or lessons , I have heard here and there .
11.6088	I honestly believe we have a balanced system - though I will not claim that it is simple and straightforward .
4.3505	That is what I will take away from this debate , this Presidency and this Intergovernmental Conference .
229.3053	As far as the Treaty of Nice is concerned , we can say very little , because we do not yet have the conclusions of the European Council , and therefore , until we see them , we can not add much .
497.9561	For the rest the Treaty is a mixture of unsatisfactory and positive things - unsatisfactory but nonetheless better than the status quo , I suppose , at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting , the extension of the codecision procedure for the European Parliament , and the provisions for enhanced cooperation .
823.4264	There is the fact that under enhanced cooperation the European Parliament has no role , although certain leaders of national parties - including the leader of the Labour Party in his Warsaw speech - promised no reform of the structural funds in real terms until 2013 .
268.4149	Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are winners and losers , but Europe can not claim to be one of the winners and democracy and transparency certainly can not .
10.2621	It is totally unacceptable .
194.8641	The outermost regions deserve better and Parliament will continue to work flat out - with Commissioner Barnier ' s help , I am sure - to give them all the space they are entitled to within the Union .
57.2351	`` We were able to keep matters under our own control '' or `` We were able to block European decisions '' , they said in their own countries .
33.1431	It is deplorable and the only hopeful sign is that the European Commission has clearly recovered its sense of self-confidence .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
1294.3411	Mr President , I would like to start by stressing the fact that this year 's budget is due in particular to the work of all the Members of the committee itself , in addition , of course , to the work of the committee chairman , Mr Wynn , who has steered us with wisdom through the various situations , and tense moments which we have experienced .
82.3186	The Member States were not afraid of public opinion at home then and the enlargement to Spain and Portugal was accompanied by a major mobilisation of resources .
28.0086	We shall therefore be forced to accept a supplementary budget which will again seriously reduce , if not eliminate any potential savings in this category .
0.4365	Neither was there a qualified majority within this House to revert to Article 272 .
79.1846	Then when I discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding Article 25 of the IIA , I was , to say the least , somewhat disappointed .
0.6644	However , the European Parliament can not carry on forever reducing its external commitments .
612.8685	When we make use of 1.06 per cent of the Member States ' GDP , this gives us a margin greater than ever before and greater than that predicted in Berlin less than two years ago .
1172.3896	We must not lose our sense of environmental direction by promoting small , local measures , however badly they may be needed , or by blindly shelling out money to institutions which appear to produce little in the way of results , which applies , in my view , to the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen .
48.9981	First , the structure of the budget in 2001 : one speaker said that the agricultural budget would not rise sufficiently .
1962.5143	I think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving Serbia the help it needs on this occasion , although I fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a European flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of Europe to another , depending on where it is needed .
162.1587	I am expecting a more extensive discussion to take place next month via the topical and urgent debate , and would suggest that we only give a limited preview of this debate in these resolutions .
77.2173	There are various regions where we could start the ball rolling , such as the Balkans , the Caucasus region and Central Asia .
1.5677	Many of the transit routes for these are through areas of great conflict .
105.6841	This highlights the importance of the strategy towards the Russian Federation and , at the same time , the importance of your report , Mr Oostlander .
56.3478	The most important area of cooperation is energy policy , which is connected with superpower politics , which governs , for example , the transportation of oil and gas from the east to the west .
163.8895	A member of my party , a radical militant journalist , was murdered several weeks ago in Tbilisi , a city clearly under the control of Russian troops .
33.4174	A separate budgetary heading is being proposed for the Northern Dimension and increased aid to Russia , in general , is being recommended .
115.6780	It is this interest which has led the Union to develop specific fields of activity in numerous areas in the common strategy towards the Russian Federation and other documents .
15273.8310	Recital KK in the report states the following : ` given that Russia is in a political union with Belarus , it is appropriate in the interest of Russia ' s democratic legitimacy for President Putin and the Russian government to point out clearly and consistently the comprehensive need for democratic progress and reforms in Belarus , not least in the light of the report submitted by the parliamentary troika from the EU , the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe -LRB- OSCE -RRB- in Minsk on 16 October 2000 ' .
19.4186	The Northern Dimension , which is important , will receive its own budget funds under this proposal , which is a very important issue .
509.9928	Other areas where we seek to bolster European Union cooperative efforts towards Russia are the rule of law and democracy building , civil society , twinnings as well as regional and cross-border cooperation and , above all , the Northern Dimension Initiative , to which a number of Members referred .
93.7971	Just a word on Kaliningrad : the partnership and cooperation agreement already offers an institutional framework for our dialogue with Russia on trade , visa and border issues .
42.3803	If more favourable visa requirements are applied to the inhabitants of secessionist regions or if they are exempted altogether , this would imply support for the legitimacy of their regimes .
33.0371	The question was as follows : there have been cases where this directive has been breached and GMOs have been released into the environment .
34.8983	I fear that you are taking us into a fundamental debate which we do not have time to go into here and now .
144.0961	The Council continues to be deeply concerned by the situation in Chechnya , where violence continues and the humanitarian situation continues to be very worrying at the onset of winter .
215.1711	Could the French Presidency take the baton from us and contact Mr Nielson , urging him to go to Chechnya in the near future ?
16.3311	This is not one of them . You can see for yourselves that the Chamber is far from full .
5.5074	Mr President , I think the question was quite specific .
1.7679	You are right , the fight against fraud is never sufficiently well developed .
543.2441	I nonetheless believe that the proposal tabled by the French Presidency is completely unacceptable and that it really has only one aim , namely to keep asylum seekers out of the EU , something which may in practice lead to an increase in illegal immigration .
231.0892	Last month when I asked a supplementary question in Question Time , this President-in-Office simply avoided giving me a supplementary by saying : `` I can only repeat my previous answer '' and reading out the previous answer again .
58.6249	I can assure all the Members of the European Parliament who have asked me questions that the Council will take their comments into consideration .
19.5054	The Council ' s objective in all these decisions is to restore consumer confidence within the European Union .
20.4885	As you know , we continually act according to the latest state of our knowledge , and so I can not completely endorse this analysis .
16.2327	These are the initiatives which the Council has taken or intends to take with regard to the Algerian authorities .
871.6498	As regards your second question , the Council is in complete agreement with the point of view of the General Secretary of the United Nations that all the institutions concerned and also experts , research bodies or academic institutions which have a special interest in children ' s issues should be involved in this exercise .
174.8581	The Presidency is very pleased with this result , which marks a significant stage in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy for Turkey defined last year in Helsinki .
2229.1689	I refer to guarantees such as the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one ' s own choosing or , if one has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance , to be given it free when the interests of justice so require ; to have the free assistance of an interpreter if one can not understand or speak the language used in court ; right to trial within a reasonable time , or to release pending trial .
26.1159	So , as the Council stated in its previous answer , the programme for mutual recognition can only bring improvements in terms of fundamental rights .
6.4341	The decision to launch an operation would , in principle , take the form of a joint action .
1.9852	The honourable Member ' s question concerns the unofficial opinions expressed by the Commission President .
241.3018	Mr President , I have great pleasure in presenting the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Croatia and the European Union to this part session of the European Parliament .
8.9792	The European Union emphasised this again by the summit held in Zagreb on 24 November .
86.8165	I can see no contradiction between the one-to-one relations between the European Union and Croatia and the various Balkan countries , and regional cooperation .
85.3974	That issue must be based on other conditions , namely whether access to asylum in Croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum .
3.1881	Unfortunately , we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture .
5.2745	We hope to make swift progress in these negotiations and to be able to conclude them rapidly .
116.4280	I know that it is the strong view of the Croatian Government that countries participating in the stabilisation and association process must be judged on an individual basis on their own merits .
486.4209	Of course , in many respects the hard part is only just beginning , but I have every confidence that the people of Croatia are equal to the challenge , equal to the difficult path of reform , the path to Europe that now lies ahead .
45.2526	The problem the government is struggling with is seen most clearly in the regions that were used as migration destinations owing to over-population , and that were also misused as conquered land .
13.1342	The EU ought to take the same line .
0.5712	We are very concerned and expect the European Commission to respond to these developments .
4967.3689	But the level of this cooperation must take into account the effective progress the country may make in solving regional problems and the methods used for solving them , its respect for human rights , and also the country ' s collaboration in the positive development of the Timor Lorosae independence process , particularly in solving the problems faced by the West Timor refugees and in prosecuting and sentencing militia members who have behaved criminally and only recently murdered three United Nations workers .
9.9060	The revolution in the country and the way in which it took place , remain the basis for cautious optimism .
3.0052	Military influence may have been reduced but is still far too great .
1085.1427	Mrs Maij-Weggen has written an outstanding report and I would therefore conclude that Europe must do all it can to support the country on its way to democracy , but at the end of the day , it is up to the Indonesians themselves to erase the traces of the Suharto regime .
6.0623	She is quite forthright in naming the opposing forces of the essential and exacting process of reform .
22.5868	Any outside intervention other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory to all parties .
10.8643	Since then time has certainly not stood still in Indonesia .
8.4697	Only two years ago Indonesia was still ruled by a military-backed authoritarian leader .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
6.8435	Meanwhile parts of it have become out-dated and the Nice summit has not improved matters either .
12.8522	However , we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection .
24.8239	Mr President , I can be very brief because this is not the first discussion we have held on the issue .
192.7454	We do not believe that more solutions at Community level can improve the fight against crime because the efforts will be characterised by just as much indifference , slovenliness and secrecy as the EU ' s administration in general .
77.2118	My personal view is that the European Public Prosecutor is just the first step along the road to corpus juris , a body of common law across the continent .
1.8104	We lose serious amounts of money because it is not collected by the Member States .
20.1484	You know that the Commission would have preferred OLAF to be set up as a totally independent authority .
331.2818	We must not forget that it was the reluctance of Parliament to give the green light to the way Euro-taxpayers ' money was spent in 1996 that precipitated the fall of the Commission in 1999 .
9.4239	We depend on the Court of Auditors to provide us with the ammunition to fire at the problem areas .
17.4766	We are trying to watch the Commission and the Member States and this report is an attempt at doing that .
108.3602	Mr President , I would like to start by commending the timeliness of this initiative and the diligence with which our rapporteur , Eluned Morgan , has carried it out .
7.4278	In the final analysis , we must be able to assess whether it is getting better or worse .
29.8876	For in fact , the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions , especially with regard to the FlÃ © chard affair .
141.7423	I am sure that this House wishes her every success in that particular project , although I am slightly worried that the baby 's first words might include the words `` discharge '' and `` procedure '' .
69.2482	Let me point out to Mrs Stauner who just raised certain questions that under this agreement the committee chairperson puts questions regarding confidential information to the Commission or forwards them to it .
15.7390	Once again , congratulations on your report .
87.4980	To inscribe in a directive that shareholders must be paid an equitable price is about as useful as saying that an apple will fall from the tree when it is ripe .
61.3188	So I can only ask this House to endorse the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market 's compromise amendments .
1702.4432	To be effective , useful and in the public interest , such a directive must : first , avoid direct involvement of the courts , but rather have a regulator with wide powers of discretion under the rule of law ; secondly , clarify and have workable rules on jurisdiction ; thirdly , clarify definitions of equitable price and set proper thresholds ; fourthly , ensure management can not improperly frustrate shareholders taking their legitimate decisions about the future of the company in which they own a stake .
181.4846	It is true that the European Parliament Rules of Procedure do not make this easy , making these debates into a pure and simple dialogue between the deaf .
33.2155	Lastly , the issue of clarity : the lack of this is especially evident in the debate about jurisdiction , an issue of which I have a little experience .
20.4071	The European institutions care little about the job losses and closures caused by almost every company takeover or merger .
84.7455	If , moreover , we open the door to defensive measures , we shall perhaps make it more difficult to restructure European markets and , especially , to protect small shareholders .
19.9118	Hitherto we have not had binding rules on take-overs either in Community law or in the legislation of a good number of Member States .
573.7927	Mr President , I would like to thank Parliament for the attention it is giving this proposal and for the work that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and particularly the rapporteur , Mr Lehne , have carried out .
20.5341	These only concern holders of securities in the first case and the supervisory authority in the second .
22.5823	The third part of it is unacceptable for the same reason that no so-called ` social amendments ' are acceptable .
12.3261	That is not acceptable in the European market and is contrary to the requirements of the single market .
59.7008	This is based on the quite mistaken assumption that it is compulsory to involve collective management firms , as has hitherto been the case in Austria .
186.9153	The Socialist Group did not therefore want Parliament to discredit itself by accepting proposals which make a mockery of the votes cast at the first reading .
13.2064	The opinions expressed on the right of resale reflect the views not of the political groups but of the Member States .
17.5054	There is KÃ '' nstler gegen Folgerecht .
225.9294	At any event , why as a matter of principle should it be right to impose a levy on the sale of a second-hand picture and not to do the same to the maker of a second-hand car or the tailor of a second-hand suit ?
73.9524	Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 7 which relates to this issue should also be rejected for the same reasons .
72.5954	It seems to me an impossible state of affairs when we are debating a very important subject and amendments have come in late , together with those that went to committee , and we do not have them in our mother tongue .
5.1045	For that reason , conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation .
9.2050	We decided in committee to leave the question of special services as it is regulated in Directive 97/67/EC .
117.0115	Madam President , there would be much more to say , but I shall confine myself to adding that only rarely has there been such political consensus on an issue among the various committees called upon to express their opinions in this Parliament .
8.7353	That is our responsibility .
48.8190	However , my group also takes the view that we as a Community and as Member States must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too .
19.4469	Yet we are expected to go along the lines that the Commission wanted without ever seeing those so-called studies .
3.3225	We often pontificate here about being the representatives of the citizens of Europe .
12.0684	We are now facing a peculiar situation , really .
11.4422	Secondly , reference is made to the 1997 Directive .
12.2251	I would be very clear on one particular matter .
15.7245	While electronic communication , such as e-mail , has enjoyed a real boom , former state monopolies are mainly turning inward .
5.7170	There is a connection between all of this .
3.9990	I speak in support of the 150-gramme limit for reasons of caution .
248.5457	I am not a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the market or of liberalisation , but the request that was made for a systematic , professional and painstaking analysis of all the implications of the directive has not been met , and that is why I am prepared to accept the present compromise proposal .
77.8297	Fortunately , there is a directive in place which prescribes transparency for public companies , and I can assure you that gross subsidies will be monitored at very close range .
18.7642	You do not appear to have learnt anything , and you do not appear to have listened to the arguments that were put to you .
9.9180	Consumers will lose out , employees will lose out , Europe will lose competitive strength and growth .
24.2082	The proposed liberalisation has sweeping implications for the services in rural areas , for employees of postal companies and for private users of the post .
59.1622	It is regrettable that the Commission opted instead to bulldoze ahead with the ideological proposal that fails to pay attention to the views of the people .
3.1024	This sector is already suffering from enormous competition from those new technologies .
49.4791	When the left-wing coalition cites realism in an attempt to obtain a compromise solution with a right-wing party , it is a way of disguising its own capitulation to private interests .
18.5883	This is more than enough to support the public tasks , such as adequate universal provision of services and a uniform rate .
0.5754	I do not take any lessons from the Labour Party about the rural areas .
32.7215	Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , who indeed had a difficult task .
6.7986	It is a decision that you will regret .
74.5578	Mr President , the Commission realises from previous discussions the great importance of this subject for Parliament and I have carefully looked at the numerous amendments to the proposed directive .
62.9881	In short it would be too little , too late , and would bring to a sudden halt the much needed momentum for further change , gravely harming the incumbent adaptation and threatening long-term employment .
139.1735	Firstly , the chief executive of the UK post office , Mr John Roberts , has talked about competition leading to improvements in quality and efficiency and lower prices .
11.7553	The monopoly of postal services would cause them to ossify and lose volume which would lead to losses of jobs .
20.8746	We must maintain the momentum for change and achieve a solid first step , plus a timetable for further change .
30.6245	I notice that the postal services are helping us to warm up the House a little , and I am glad about that .
349.4071	In particular , the report proposed rejecting the automatic transition to a ` tariff only ' system , a rating preference for the ACP countries of at least EUR 300 and an assessment and possible revision of the COM ' s internal aspects .
2620.2146	Other than that our position thus remains the same : apply the system for at least ten years in order to guarantee producers ' and operators ' legal security and then re-examine the system at the end of the ten years ; no automatic transition to a ` tariff only ' system ; and a rating preference of EUR 300 for the ACP countries .
44.5197	Mr Schwaiger said during the previous debate that you should have information which further supplements all the different points of view on the problem .
1267.0251	The workings of the compromise that has been reached , which comes within the WTO rules , must be studied by the European Commission in a report which will have to be studied by Parliament within a reasonable time limit and , in accordance with the result of that report and the study made of it , the appropriate corrective measures will have to be proposed , as Mr Dary ' s report suggests .
10.7455	Mr President , for perplexed observers such as myself , this issue is moving from the bizarre to the surreal .
7.6760	Strong forces are lined up against us .
32.1205	However , I believe that we can forecast negative effects on the smaller commercial operators and on producers in the ACP countries .
218.6107	Mr President , may I first of all highlight Parliament ' s effort in reaching a balanced solution to this complex web of interests that surrounds the COM in bananas .
108.4182	The dispute with the WTO has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in Member States who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors .
45.5765	The important thing is to gain time in this final straight and I propose that we vote in favour of Mr Dary ' s report .
132.7953	Mr President , once again , the House is going to deliver its opinion on the banana issue , and I congratulate Michel Dary on his remarkable work .
221.8672	We wish to strengthen our cooperation with the Republic of Korea and we now have an excellent opportunity to discuss the events that have recently taken place on the Korean Peninsular .
26.9125	-LRB- Parliament approved the Commission proposal -RRB-
92.8593	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I confirm the position which Mr Bolkestein set out yesterday evening on behalf of the Commission .
6.6114	-LRB- The President declared the common position approved as amended -RRB-
14.6422	It therefore now reads `` Croatian citizens of Serb origin '' .
19.3762	-LRB- Parliament accepted the oral amendment -RRB-
491.4724	I wish to support the decisive decision by the EP to vote for the introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets , This is a huge breakthrough for public health as we now have labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the real cost of smoking .
8.1487	The European Court of Justice has now confirmed that my position was correct .
19.2383	So this move will not lead to healthier cigarettes being smoked - but simply to export jobs from Europe .
7.8641	They have misled people for far too long .
59.9111	Note that these are major programmes aimed at improvements in public health , the fight against cancer , AIDS prevention , the fight against drug dependence , health monitoring and pollution-related diseases .
13.6508	I do not see why we can not entrust the management of their own social welfare to the public as well .
72.9121	Well , in my opinion , we should also do something - I would advocate in the near future - about artists ' pensions .
44.5964	This is why I am of the opinion that the international art market will move outside of Europe as a result of the directive .
379.8860	- -LRB- FR -RRB- Apart from its seeking to make an impact by setting out good intentions regarding stability , the rule of law and the fight against corruption , the Oostlander report is in fact nothing more than a vote of confidence in Mr Putin .
31.3138	Maij-Weggen report -LRB- A5-0323 / 2000 -RRB-
84.8055	And if we add to the corruption of the European public employees the corruption of the employees of the national State bodies , then the result will be an increase in fraud .
4.9333	The creation of this new authority must not lead to any transfer of sovereignty in core areas .
6.1908	I should like , therefore , to apologise to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the House .
0.2195	I have received many letters about the fact that it is an emotive issue .
6.5129	There must be a balance as a whole .
38.8771	However , the Commission can certainly give you this information annually in Parliament on the basis of the information available to us at the time .
702.2895	On Amendments Nos 19 and 32 , concerning organically produced bananas , may I say once again that there are already horizontal measures in place to guarantee the equivalence of organic bananas from third countries with those produced in the Community .
1.8293	The better the relationship , the safer the world and the better off our people .
111.5136	There are some differences in our approach to these matters , but I hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including tiered pricing .
294.4138	From Kosovo to Belfast , millions of European citizens have cause to be thankful for the contribution he has made and I know that the House will join with me in paying tribute to that contribution today .
6.3813	I believe you touched on an important point there .
6.7982	'' Lesotho has said : `` What has the WTO market liberalisation brought to Lesotho ?
131.6098	I believe that advantage should be taken of the dialogue that exists between the European Union and the United States in order to finally achieve this objective .
211.6358	I was interested by what Mrs Lucas said about world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that increasingly free trade works in the interests of the poor as well as the better off .
9.4631	That concludes this item .
96.1668	I am stressing this because some of the amendments intend to establish a zero rate of VAT for services which , in my opinion , are not of an essential or social nature .
9.2406	In my view , this solution resolves the problem of eliminating previous discrimination and achieves the objective of simplification .
325.1363	Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission and Parliament have in recent years made great efforts to achieve harmonisation in the levying of VAT within the European Union .
4.4710	The Industry Committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three .
64.0521	There are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context .
43.0070	Plenty of reason , therefore , to take a close look at whether aviation is carrying its external costs and not prejudicing the train or bus owing to unfair competition .
21.7829	If the transaction takes place within the European Union between two Member States , VAT is levied .
41.0902	It is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day .
73.6132	Therefore , we Liberals share the Commission 's ambitions , but we find it very hard to understand the specific proposals put forward by the Commission .
5.8673	I think it is important to establish some criteria .
984.6979	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal of the European Commission intended to make the purchasing of digital products which can be downloaded directly from the Internet by consumers resident in the Union from extra-Community firms subject to VAT is a heavy blow for the development of e-commerce .
34.1993	Therefore , as to the Commission 's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced , I can only express my neutrality .
175.5001	I oppose Mrs Torres Marques ' call for harmonisation of VAT , but what I would really like to address is the GarcÃa - Margallo report on e-commerce .
311.2071	All States redistribute at least 30 % , often 40 % and occasionally more than 50 % of their national wealth created during the year .
42.3247	Minimum rates , and possibly a maximum rate , are needed , but the States need to be allowed room for manoeuvre to enable them to pursue their own microeconomic policies .
1239.9048	I personally tabled an amendment on the harmonisation of VAT rates , which would correct the effects of unfair competition resulting from third country operators ' power to choose when it comes to registering , since there is a very broad range of VAT rates available to them - between 15 and 25 % - while domestic operators have no choice .
170.6319	If we were now to go it alone in Europe and tax aircraft fuel , European operators would scarcely be able to compete with airlines based outside Europe .
31.2150	That is not how we are meant to organise society , and that is why I think this proposal is an excellent one .
1381.3884	Not only would our air fares increase dramatically - possibly by Â # 80 per ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carriers - but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers , tourism , businesses and , of course , the freight carriers - they now carry a third of freight world-wide by air .
163.1983	Like Mr Skinner , I think that the proposals from the rapporteur , Mr GarcÃa - Margallo y Marfil , regarding VAT on e-commerce are good .
4.4556	I only intend to speak about the taxation of aviation fuel .
172.2052	To levy VAT on third-country suppliers , largely American , is not only impractical but , in the case of newspapers and books , it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop .
72.0870	One last point is that the EU should not legislate in haste and should make every effort to strengthen e-commerce and to avoid undermining it .
1.0156	The outcome of that consultation was discussed within Ecofin at the end of November .
0.1881	All in all , a number of details still need to be looked at .
203.6194	It is in the light of this that this proposal is seeking to maintain the existing level of harmonisation in the field of VAT rates by confirming the minimum level of 15 % for the normal rate .
66.2825	I would , however , like to point out that current Community tax legislation does not allow for only national and intra-Community flights to be taxed .
181.5641	One year after the sinking of the Erika , we must all ask ourselves whether or not we have really been able to meet the expectations of Europe ' s citizens .
258.8486	In the event that the IMO does not adopt the necessary measures , the Commission would submit a proposal to Parliament and the Council on a Community system for responsibility and compensation in the event of pollution by hydrocarbons .
17.7739	Parliament took its decision on 30 November ; you presented a good document , and we decided quickly .
143.6130	With regard to the issue of responsibility , I will only say that the current fund is not sufficient to provide compensation for all the damage caused by the Erika oil slick .
571.0692	Mr Ortuondo , in relation to your intervention on Article 6 , on responsibility in the case of less serious pollution , I can tell you that the first thing I am going to find out is what the Council thinks , but Parliament has already adopted a position on this issue .
152.9175	The overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the EU internal market .
7.7995	I thought mine and this would be coupled together but apparently that is not the procedure in this House .
3.5107	Policy towards imports from third countries will be decided in the light of this assessment .
9.2198	The role of the European Union can not be to fund incitement to hatred and warfare .
15.4103	I have asked you about the Commission ' s participation in educational programmes , and you avoided the question .
0.4199	Will he look at ways of expanding that section of the Community 's budget ?
431.2361	Let me say about Texaco that the Centre for Economic and Social Rights says that in Ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates .
572.6467	How does it intend to guarantee the survival of what remains of the industry from January 2001 onwards in the face of unfair competition from Korea , further evidence of which is contained in its latest report ?
44.3090	Commissioner , firstly , to a certain extent I feel reassured because I notice that the Commission has been concerned with , and has perhaps also done something about , this problem .
1559.0291	We believe that would not be represented by an across-the-board continuation of the existing operating aid but rather by the Commission being prepared to come up with a focused and specific instrument in the event of the actions undertaken by Commissioner Lamy on behalf of the Commission not being successful for the European Union industry .
13.1491	The increase in prices which would result from the anti-dumping measures should enable the coke industry to become profitable again .
78.2415	This proposal , which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the Community in favour of least and less developed countries , is aimed at promoting the integration of these countries into the world economy .
6.9248	I am sure all my colleagues are very grateful .
18.5448	This ties in with Mrs Kinnock ' s question .
521.7825	To that end , could you perhaps reassure me firstly when the impact assessment will be available to us so that we can cite it to perhaps explode some of the apocalyptic claims that have surrounded your proposal and , secondly , give some more details about the safeguard clause which I think you are considering introducing into this measure and also the transition period before the measure finally gets implemented ?
10.2517	These different instruments are also open to organisations like ECPAT and their partners in the countries concerned .
6.0957	We have had a particular project for that .
10.0727	This is why the patent office is based in Munich .
2.7069	That is certainly an understandable point of view , which I share .
5.5054	Accordingly , the Commission will take all measures which it deems necessary .
25.0269	The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that a complaint is pending regarding the Thessaloniki underground rail project .
523.1782	In this context , I would also like to point out that the plaintiff , from the time that the franchise agreement was made public in Greece , has taken eight months to make up his own mind and lodge his complaint with the Commission .
0.2121	It is up to the Member State to decide whether a strike is legal .
3511.1132	I should like to thank the Commissioner for attempting to answer my question , but I should point out that students in Greece are currently somewhat confused because the free study centres are claiming that they are able to issue study diplomas which qualify for recognition under Directive 89/48/EEC , if , and provided that , the course in question is completed in Britain , while the Greek authorities and the competent bodies are refusing to recognise diplomas issued for courses completed in Britain .
39.6548	declaring the island of Raippaluoto off Vaasa an independent kingdom , through which shipping firms can pass and thus continue their tax-free sales .
283.3626	However , I am certain I can say on behalf of my colleague Michel Barnier that the facts which have been mentioned by the honourable Member will duly be taken into account when an analysis is made of that proposal .
93.3079	If I can say briefly what is important in my report and what I believe is the key priority for this Parliament , it is the issue of linguistic diversity .
48.5302	It is essential that we sell to them the potential gains and opportunities of investing in companies that are taking on board linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information .
173.1380	This means that digital content offers an opportunity to all those who have not had access to schooling , be it lifelong training or because they are handicapped , and I want digital content to make a better approach to such people possible .
30.1058	Similarly , we need localisation of content production , which is a means of adapting products according to linguistic and cultural needs and the liking of consumers .
4.7755	Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Gill on her report .
68.8521	The content providers , the creative element , the people who are ultimately responsible for the production of content , the very people who are targeted by the e-content programme should therefore be involved in the consultation process .
10.7803	Before I conclude , allow me to raise a final important point , a final question addressed to the Commission .
3.5216	I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for the budget of the programme .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
11.4041	I now give the floor to the rapporteur , Mr De Roo .
7.3664	Too much noise from infrastructure affects the health of human beings , and reduces their quality of life .
54.7020	In this proposal , the Environmental Committee lays down specific standards for the years 2006 , 2012 and 2020 .
451.6301	All the more reason , therefore , for a People ' s Party such as ours , the PPE-DE , not to let aviation escape European legislation and to scrap the distinction made between military and civil aviation .
35.7317	My group , however , does not support the rapporteur 's intention to use the directive to introduce limit values for ambient noise in the vicinity of airports .
274.8905	I therefore agree with the rapporteur , Mr De Roo , when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive .
5.5494	Another group may claim that the proposal contains technical problems .
9.9851	It would be the Member States who would determine the length of that period , according to their own customs .
17.3324	I have certainly been astounded to hear one or two speakers say that we need daughter directives .
445.7285	So we do need a framework directive and we need the combined approach , and I therefore regard much of what the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided as right and proper .
7.3915	That is not what we want .
0.2547	Getting comparable information about the noise around airports will be a big step forward .
9.8064	The debate is closed .
7.1776	This study has never been carried out .
198.1804	Mr President , at this late hour and with a piece of carrot stuck in my throat , I doubt whether I have much else to say to my fellow MEPs .
22.7182	These people have knowledge , accumulated over many years , about cellulose as a binding agent , particularly in bread .
7.1881	As I already explained during second reading , there is a crisis underlying this directive amendment .
46.6190	In my opinion , our Parliament is tightening up on the Council ' s common position considerably and I recommend approval of the common draft text .
154.3201	I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support of the European Commission 's position and the remarkable effort made to meet the concerns of the Council .
227.2848	We know that the Commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the European Union , and that should be ready in six months ' time .
3.7241	As a legislative institution we should not seek at any time to exacerbate the urban/rural divide .
301.4336	The appropriations would be mainly allocated to networks of towns and cities organised at European level and in order to support their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices where sustainable urban development is concerned .
33.8963	In practice , it is also at the local level that the environmental decisions we take here in Parliament are to be implemented .
0.2287	I believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow .
236.5112	The Commission can not accept Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 31 , 38 and 39 .
84.1656	Indeed , even if it is only recently that the media have begun publicising it , the precautionary principle has not only just made its appearance on the international legal scene .
309.5238	- -LRB- DE -RRB- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Legal Affairs Committee identified a few key points concerning the precautionary principle , reflecting concerns which are also expressed in Mrs Patrie 's excellent report .
155.3627	The public no longer wants to bear the brunt of hazardous technological innovations which several or many years later prove to have entailed unnecessary risk to public health or the environment .
15.8381	I am in favour of the precautionary principle , but I would like to mention one area of concern .
0.2228	There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well .
70.7717	Firstly , that there is no minimum threshold of risk below which the precautionary principle must not be applied and , consequently , even in cases where there is little risk , it would have to be used .
13.0955	In my amendments which I have tabled , I attempt to clarify these matters and delete a number of redundant paragraphs .
185.7660	It is incomprehensible that the European Union should remain insensitive to the dozens of independent scientific studies that point to the possible risk posed by mobile telephones to human health .
7.8821	Producers and manufacturers must be able to present proof that a product is in fact safe .
44.6195	Mr President , adapted to every contingency , according to the circumstances and interests of the moment , the precautionary principle may be either the best of things or the worst of things .
33.2079	We consider it as a general principle which should be taken into consideration in the fields of environmental protection and human , animal and plant health .
17.7562	Thank you , Commissioner Liikanen .
7.3253	Our European Community is above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law .
530.5584	We know that we are not important individually , but we believe that what unites and motivates us is important : the rejection of ETA ' s criminal terrorism and explicit support for the Spanish rule of law , which today is being threatened by a totalitarian project for violent secession .
40.9224	Ladies and gentlemen , as democrats , we are , of course , in favour of dialogue between different democratic parties , because democracy itself is embodied in that ongoing dialogue .
18.3371	We have now signed the budget for 2001 .
14.6711	-LRB- In successive votes , Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions -RRB-
21.3054	-LRB- Parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment being tabled -RRB- -LRB- Parliament adopted the legislative resolution -RRB-
58.1999	Before we proceed to the explanations of votes , I would like to wish all those Members I will not be seeing afterwards a very merry Christmas .
468.5402	Since it was set up , the Cohesion Fund has had a considerable impact on two areas of great Community interest - the environment and trans-European transport networks ; it has been effectively implemented in the Community budget and has had one of the highest implementation rates in the entire Community budget .
61.2044	We are asking for a considerable supplementary and amending budget in January to demonstrate the interest that Parliament intends to give to this dossier .
126.7040	This also means , of course , that the Government of Luxembourg is once more being called upon not only to be vigilant but also to guarantee compliance with contractual agreements .
72.7301	This needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future , partly so as to provide room for the enlargement of the EU .
28.4775	Mr President , I voted for this report on food additives and , in particular , for the ban on using sodium alginate to preserve carrots .
150.1854	I suggest that he also sends a copy to Malta , since the only time he has failed to give an explanation of vote was , I believe , when we were discussing Malta .
876.7576	Today I voted in favour of the Ferber report on `` European postal services '' because , given the current balance of power in Europe and within the European Parliament , we obtained as much as we could to prevent the total disappearance of public postal services in Europe !
49.6169	I am truly sorry that Parliament voted to support a policy that is very harmful as far as consumers are concerned .
10.5470	I emphatically reject such insinuations .
3.8928	It is not good enough to call for liberalisation without realising the effects of our decisions .
26.5568	In Sweden a number of these proposals have already been implemented and we can already see that this has exacerbated the situation .
49.5201	We hope there will now be speedy negotiations to agree arrangements compatible with our WTO commitments and safeguard our traditional suppliers .
30.8954	Let me make this quite clear : I am aware of the importance of this body , but what I , like others , refuse to accept is globalisation !
3.5929	Secondly , the report takes an approach to linguistic and cultural diversity which is too negative .
527.4082	Europe is clearly in a position to respond to the challenge of the markets , due to its advantages in economic and employment terms , and , of course , due to its cultural wealth and linguistic diversity - which are shown clearly in the concept of linguistic minorities and regional languages - over the monolingualism that characterises much of the `` Web '' .
499.0478	Mr President , I asked my daughter Elisabetta , who , as you know , is the regional representative of the Pensioners ' Party for Lombardy - to give me her opinion on the Nice Council and to tell me whether she felt I should vote for the motion .
10.8634	The European Union is now ready for the candidate countries to join .
134.9035	They may have succeeded in this , at least for the moment , but at the cost of serious problems , such as greater supranationality , less democracy and greater German influence in the decision-making process .
39.9287	Some people may consider this development to be perfectly legitimate , because it tends to transpose the weighting of each country into the institutions according to the size of their populations .
117.5815	There is thus a real risk that it will become more difficult to implement essential legislation on the environment , consumer protection and the working environment , and we strongly recommend the states to demonstrate responsibility and to make the decision-making procedures in the Council more efficient .
23.4852	The negotiations were tough but the strength of the Union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all .
1121.9140	This situation is exacerbated by the extension of decision making by qualified majority , under which , in certain circumstances , only 14 countries can make decisions on behalf of the 27 or 28 , thus , in practice , eliminating the right of veto on policies that are highly important for Portugal , such as the Structural Funds or commercial policy agreements .
7.3335	Unanimous decisions , and hence an inherent incapacity to act , remain largely the norm in the Council .
376.4229	In our view , for as long as Europe is what it is , questions of a constitutional nature or of fundamental interest for the States , such as those that were debated in Nice , should not be resolved by any other means ; that is , they should require unanimity .
1.5803	It increases the power of the big countries at the expense of the small countries .
7.6116	Not only reduced staffing levels and other cuts , but also government policy have brought the prices down .
1.5280	' ` Well , let 's go to bed and make love . '
3220.7997	While the Commission proposes a switch from project-based to programme-based funding , on which opinions may well be divided - I , for one , believe that it represents a loss of European added value , visibility and closeness to the people and , moreover , not all Member States have established the requisite regional authorities - the financing of innovative measures from the European Social Fund remains project-based .
133.1856	The trick is to know which will succeed and flourish but we should also have the strength to know that when something has failed we should not prop it up at public expense and develop a strategy that takes this into account .
1.7666	Tourism is an important means of livelihood in many remote areas as well .
0.3833	It is a good report , based on a good paper from the Commission .
63.5213	I particularly agree with his consideration that regional policy instruments should be directed towards sustainability , strengthening economic and social cohesion and , above all , creating skilled , economically viable , lasting jobs .
1019.4984	One is that we - and the people out there - see that the innovative measures have been a very important stepping stone for local authorities and local communities who are not really into the Structural Funds , but should be , to learn how to do it through small-scale projects and then be able to become more effective parts of mainstream programmes in future years .
92.2036	The door is closed to them and we have lost that added value provided by the direct relationship between the European capital and the public institutions closest to the problems of the citizens .
64.1286	That is why we selected these three priorities - technological innovation , the information society and regional identity and sustainable development - as our strategic priorities .
19.6428	I understand your wish to maintain direct links between the European Union and regional and local players .
9.7669	Thank you , Commissioner .
11176.1773	The decision taken by the Council and the Commission to negotiate for four months without continuing the payment of aid and then , after 1 May 2001 , to reconsider , on the basis of the progress achieved in these negotiations , whether there are grounds for resuming aid payments for a further period will mean that European shipyards will receive virtually no new orders in the first four months of the year 2001 , at least not for the shipping categories in which competition is fiercest .
7.3871	Other countries - Japan for one - are also suffering from this .
127.0139	We are also worried about the sixth framework programme for research and development : the ` marine technology ' line in the fifth programme appears to have disappeared in the draft programme .
16.1528	Mr President , it seems to have become an end-of-year tradition to hold a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding industry .
299.1432	In recent weeks , the Commission has told us that the system of subsidies , thanks to which our industry is subsisting , must be removed as from January as a result of a supposed improvement in competitiveness .
9.5293	In other words , the state is paying a large chunk , if not all of the company 's profits .
8.1082	And that is due to the fact that we are incapable of condemning a situation of unfair competition .
49.4290	Discussions in the OECD have made little progress , very little progress , and the possibility of an internationally binding agreement on shipbuilding seems remote .
263.7295	It requested the Commission to continue with its market monitoring , to follow up closely on the TBR case with a view to bring the problem to the WTO if required and to address the issue in all relevant international fora .
32.4254	British submarine at Gibraltar
1.4758	There , showing themselves to be fully in charge , they parked it .
101.5091	Mr President , with regard to the repair of the British submarine Tireless in Gibraltar , we should remember what we want from the Commission .
1.8488	I would modestly like to suggest that they vote for our motion for a resolution .
15.5939	Secondly , it must demand that all possible information be given to the population , as laid down in the Euratom Treaty .
111.4684	Honourable Members have asked a number of questions relating to the presence of the British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless in Gibraltar for repairs to her nuclear reactor .
173.9590	The British authorities state that there will be no shipment of radioactive waste that will transit through any other Member State ; they also state that they are in regular contact with the Spanish authorities .
18.2443	This is a technical problem with a technical solution and the sooner the repair is completed , the better it will be for all .
7.3866	We all support the right of self-determination .
365.4924	It is significant first and foremost , and this is the point I should like to stress , because it illustrates the current state of our so-called united Europe and , from this point of view , sovereignists may even find it amusing .
646.3838	It is scandalous that , at this moment , 11 out of the 12 hunter-killer submarines in service in the Royal Navy are non-operational , with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts HMS Tireless .
144.3022	This specific issue is more serious than all that , since it affects hundreds of thousands of human beings on Community territory , not only Spaniards , but people of all nationalities and British people in particular .
398.6789	I would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the Commission that it is not the view of the UK Government that the Euratom Treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind .
169.1796	Those feelings have understandably been reflected during this debate , but honourable Members know that in responding on behalf of my colleague , Commissioner WallstrÃ ¶ m , I have to restrict myself to setting out as clearly as I can what is and what is not Community competence : what we can do and what we can not do .
17.8447	B5-0928 / 2000 by Watson , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
6.1594	The suicide rate is particularly high among young people who can no longer endure their bleak situations .
92.1731	It has taken part in specific operations when asked to do so by the Secretary-General or another authority of the United Nations , in agreement with the countries concerned .
219.1053	We will continue to follow that model for our proposals on the successor instrument to the Dublin Convention , conditions to qualify as a refugee on the basis of the Geneva Convention , and on subsidiary forms of protection .
23.6323	The Commission is also working closely with the UNHCR in trying to ensure a smooth transition between relief and development .
18.9166	B5-0929 / 2000 by Haarder and MalmstrÃ ¶ m , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
244.0868	We were told that Mr Solana was understanding of these demands but it was also pointed out that - and I quote - the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to do business with a regime such as that of Milosevic .
1.5594	That may be linked with an amnesty , or their release may precede the amnesty .
2222.9554	The request to President Kostunica to release all political prisoners from the Milosevic era , requires , as before , unrelenting diplomatic effort on the part of the European Council and Commission in Belgrade , especially since most Serb political prisoners , if not those of Albanian origin from Kosovo , have , as far as I know , now been released .
248.5662	I can assure honourable Members that it is an issue which I will take up - not least as a result of this debate - on the next visit I make to Belgrade after the elections on 23 December .
9.2854	Mozambique - B5-0907 / 2000 by QueirÃ ³ , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
19.4333	on Tunisia .
311.2133	I recall that in the European Parliament mission to Argentina , former President AlfonsÃn said to us that sometimes democracies only remember other democracies post mortem , that is , when there is no longer democracy .
639.2264	Mr President , although this Parliament is bringing southern Africa back to our agenda and particularly Mozambique , one of the poorest countries in the world , which , as we know , was devastated exactly a year ago by a huge natural disaster .
3.6213	We regret that the other political groups were not willing to do so on this occasion .
79.0494	Therefore , what we are kindly asking the Commission here is that there should be strict monitoring of the conditions in that country which , of course , does not deserve to be considered to be respecting human rights .
21.9592	Tunisia
54.6287	One example is Mehdi Zougah , a French-Tunisian citizen , who was arrested at Tunis airport on 11 August .
14.1950	The Aloes publishing house , which has been closed down several times , is prevented from publishing freely .
8.4463	The reasons for prosecution are very unclear .
177.6818	Mr President , first of all I would like to express my thanks for the solidarity expressed by other colleagues due to the recent assassination by the terrorist group ETA .
58.9839	The call for a meeting of the Association Council on the human rights situation in Tunisia should be followed by real action ...
30.1224	Our experience in Chile in the field of democracy and human rights has therefore been crucial for later projects in other countries .
206.2618	We will , over the coming weeks , have to take account of the results of the dialogue between the two political leaders , or of the absence of such a dialogue .
1.7601	The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions .
43.1239	It is no coincidence that the OAU and numerous African Heads of State have condemned the concept of Ivorian identity outright .
107.5697	The collapse of cocoa prices , the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices , among other factors , have led to an internal situation of growing tension , a notable decline in the social climate and an increase in unemployment and poverty .
89.4254	We in this Parliament must stand up for the rights of the people of CÃ ´ te d'Ivoire - and everywhere else - to a fair and properly organised democratic system with a non-partisan judiciary .
602.9815	I want to make it clear that the Commission shares Parliament 's view that the process of transition from military coup to elected government in CÃ ´ te d'Ivoire has fallen , to put it mildly , far short of the sort of democratic standards that we want to see .
62.8056	As for the slanderous allusions directed at me , I have to say that it is not my normal attitude and that at no time did I wish to alter the normal conduct of the debate .
135.2520	As the honourable Member knows , I have already addressed the Parliament twice this afternoon on this issue , but what I discussed was the Commission 's competence , not its omni-competence .
113.4268	It must respect the Treaty , and the Protocol appended to the Treaty states quite clearly that the twelve monthly part-sessions are to be held in Strasbourg .
3129.0340	This issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part , and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile , substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and , most importantly , to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource : first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource , a cultural resource and , lastly , that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations .
580.2463	The problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time , as the European Union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress , the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens .
17.7600	Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier .
45.0174	In fact , this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it .
40.0157	The OESO has been carrying out research into this area for some years now and has published reports on this topic .
2.9491	Their valuable contribution to our society is hugely neglected in this report .
77.2397	Mr President , the Commission communication is , I think , a milestone in the history of social policy because it marks the end of a period in which senior citizens were seen as a generation of outcasts or veterans .
26.1155	As the markets are only interested in young people and their purchasing power , it falls to politicians to attend to the issue of older people .
486.1715	One colleague has said that it is not we who are living for too long , it is not our society which is too old , but that centuries ago people had to die much earlier than the good Lord had preordained in our genes .
272.2015	This is a miscalculation , considering the current and future demographic situation , and also considering the fact that today ' s working population will be tomorrow ' s non-working population , in economic terms .
260.3658	The fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of age was , of course , confirmed in my report on Article 13 , which I was able to present to the House in October .
78.1923	I do not necessarily think that all women should go out to work either , because we are after all calling for the labour force penetration rate of women to be increased through changes in family and tax policy .
13.1677	I have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in Mont-Dauphin and BrianÃ § on .
30.7385	What is more , age-related issues are amongst the most important objectives setting the agenda in the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection .
14.8514	We shall now proceed to the vote .
41.1899	This approach is a welcome one , and is similar to that already employed to promote agricultural products in third countries .
81.8271	Perhaps this fact will instil a spirit of unanimity in us , which would , doubtless , knowing the great-heartedness of the Commission , lead it to accept all our amendments .
733.5182	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the WTO working group and as someone responsible , in particular , for small and medium-sized enterprises , I can only congratulate the Commission on this report and on this initiative , because it is far-sighted in already anticipating developments , which bodes well for the future .
496.5002	Obviously , this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant , and new opportunities are emerging which , at the end of the day , need to be taken .
102.2433	We now hope that Parliament will fall in line with them across the board , and I , of course , urge my own group to give you its complete support .
198.4485	The practice of mixing a fat into calf feed which comes from meat meal production - which in any case is highly dubious given the risk of BSE transmission - creates in my opinion a centre of infection for young animals .
34.1042	The system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the EU ' s agricultural policy .
41.2065	I sincerely hope that it is not anyone 's ideological view of what is safe and right that will be put forward , but information with a proper scientific basis .
103.6269	This concept of thematic information provision and promotional measures complementing national and regional measures requires strong commitment on the part of the Member States , in the form of co-financing and support for administering and monitoring the measures to be implemented .
12.2994	I appear to be the last speaker in the year 2000 , although not by design .
212.0145	To return to set-aside , if you looked , you would be able to see that , in practice , set-aside is not caused by crop rotation , but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals .
47.1374	Please think of the extra few seconds that I gave you , Mrs Lulling , as your Christmas present .
32.2003	I can fully concur with the view taken by my colleague , Mr Jan Mulder , in this respect .
