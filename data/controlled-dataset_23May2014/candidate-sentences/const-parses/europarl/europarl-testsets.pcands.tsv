0.1737	I have listened to all these proposals - I am not insensitive to them.
0.1812	That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it.
0.1865	I will, of course, inform the President of what you have said.
0.1881	All in all, a number of details still need to be looked at.
0.1899	But where there is no will, nor should there be money from us.
0.1905	There is a good chance of this, but particular efforts are still needed.
0.1937	For both these reasons, my own group cannot be expected to cooperate.
0.1994	Furthermore, there are many paragraphs to which we have specific objections, e.g.:
0.2015	However, I am not very comfortable with some of the wording in it.
0.2034	In other sectors, this directive has been extended to other fields of application.
0.204	We have, alongside this, an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation.
0.206	It is also what we want, namely trust between the producer and consumer.
0.2065	I may paint a gloomy picture, but we do have reason for hope.
0.2069	However, this does not mean that we could have done more or better.
0.2087	We abstained on this report, even the amended version.
0.209	If the author of the amendment agrees, we could proceed in that way.
0.2092	Clearly, however, there are many losers following a conference of this kind.
0.2101	It has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes.
0.2113	But that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them.
0.2116	The Commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided.
0.2121	It is up to the Member State to decide whether a strike is legal.
0.2121	The advantages are already there; they are visible and everyone stands to gain.
0.2128	Subsidiarity must serve some purpose, however, and not act as a screen.
0.2134	This is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way.
0.2141	We need commitment from the government if we are to get the funding together.
0.2151	But I would also urge Parliament to be prepared to negotiate in these matters.
0.2157	Unfortunately, we believe that some of the proposed amendments do not improve it.
0.2163	It is a matter of legal security, an efficient administration and effective democracy.
0.2164	We are dealing with a very important piece of legislation and with important articles.
0.2167	It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate.
0.2172	Both are based on a three-pillar model with state, company and private provision.
0.219	Furthermore, I think that a media code of conduct is impractical.
0.2195	I have received many letters about the fact that it is an emotive issue.
0.2202	The work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement.
0.2214	By its very nature, the service industry is less suited to this approach.
0.2228	There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well.
0.2228	They carry out statistical programmes and are responsible for inspections and the monitoring system.
0.2243	The environment is the area which will constitute a stumbling block in the negotiations.
0.2245	The recruitment procedures must be transparent to avoid all abuse; that is obvious.
0.2256	Consistency and honesty should be the hallmarks of our dealings with any applicant country.
0.2278	Mr President, what is being asked for here is a recipe for chaos.
0.228	In this respect, the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided.
0.2286	This is a consumer protection measure and also a measure to enhance consumer confidence.
0.2287	I believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow.
0.229	I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point.
0.229	The main focal point of the reform is the effort to improve financial management.
0.2297	I totally agree with all the proposals tabled by the Commission on this issue.
0.2301	I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch.
0.2302	The existing schemes, which lacked uniformity, will thus be harmonised and simplified.
0.2302	We are also critical of the decisions taken with regard to the LIFE programme.
0.231	How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act.
0.2322	This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified, independent, self-sufficient lifestyle.
0.2327	Selective aid, such as market support and a grass subsidy, are essential.
0.2341	We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same position as holy marriage.
0.2355	If hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended.
0.2362	These charges still exist, both for exchanging cash and for making cross-border payments.
0.2371	We must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests.
0.2388	If this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome.
0.2392	Since the honourable Member said she would vote against, this amendment is repealed.
0.2404	Modesty has prevented you from ending the list of rapporteurs with your own name.
0.2404	We should actively seek such cooperation and develop joint strategies with the applicant countries.
0.2409	Out of precautionary considerations, it is useful to be clear about these substances.
0.2415	We cannot find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains.
0.242	I must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected.
0.2437	But they also often destroy countries' long-term development potential by contaminating entire regions.
0.2446	That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion.
0.2458	Our debates within this Chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges.
0.2459	The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
0.2462	It is important to ensure that aid funds are not used for military purposes.
0.2483	The report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established.
0.2495	During the measurement campaign elevated levels of sulphur dioxide were observed in some hot-spots.
0.2519	Special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.
0.2521	We must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises.
0.253	That is why we must link development aid to progress in human rights abuses.
0.254	There is clarification that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted.
0.2547	Getting comparable information about the noise around airports will be a big step forward.
0.255	But we must also understand that nothing lasts forever, not even fish stocks.
0.2557	We must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled.
0.2584	We must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective.
0.26	The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option.
0.2671	Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life.
0.2724	Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs?
0.299	Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur.
0.3007	The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points.
0.3011	I would warn our Heads of Government against taking an over-minimalist stance in Nice.
0.3713	Marketing schemes for these bananas are also part of national and regional rural-development programmes.
0.3833	It is a good report, based on a good paper from the Commission.
0.3837	Need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote?
0.3878	It cannot serve as a basis for the establishment of a European constitution.
0.3983	For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised.
0.4033	We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points.
0.4061	It remains to be seen if this changes in the light of current events.
0.4066	In this context, the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention.
0.4079	Moreover, the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject.
0.408	Allow me to make a comment on Portugal, which has been mentioned here.
0.4082	Slyness does not become us: we must build a Europe of economic cooperation.
0.4108	That is to be welcomed, not feared as Mr Bonde seems to think.
0.418	A future Constitution could set out in a clear and (relatively) concise way
0.4183	Unfortunately, we all hoped that we would not have to discuss Colombia again.
0.4185	With the exception of the British delegation, our group unanimously supports the Charter.
0.4187	Any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law.
0.4199	Will he look at ways of expanding that section of the Community's budget?
0.4208	Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so.
0.4219	Mr President, we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports.
0.4253	With regard to the assessments in question, I will give just one example.
0.4268	In future, recourse to the capital market should be the only option available.
0.4275	What we need is an intelligent and flexible way of interpreting the present rules.
0.429	The EU must have the highest possible standards of food safety for its citizens.
0.4324	The reality as described in the annual report is, however, more sobering.
0.4339	We will follow the developments in Russian society and internal politics with great interest.
0.4365	Neither was there a qualified majority within this House to revert to Article 272.
0.437	We urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes.
0.439	People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another.
0.4432	However, as these provisions now stand, this mechanism cannot function correctly.
0.446	The third block contains those amendments that have been most controversial during the procedure.
0.4504	It is actually easier to defend the suburbs than it is to defend Morocco.
0.4532	The second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life.
0.4566	Old deficits have not been made good and now new ones have come along.
0.4572	I feel that this resolution marks a key point in Parliament's political initiative.
0.4594	Mr President, I am totally opposed to what is happening here in Parliament.
0.4605	Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral to committee?
0.4649	Without the facts we are fighting fraud with one hand tied behind our back.
0.4651	Mr President, first of all I must say that I welcome this report.
0.4695	The NATO war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake.
0.4698	This will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across Europe.
